in a small house the sound of congratulations Applause and fireworks echoed continuously living up the entire space a little girl with purple hair placed a crown on her brother's head smiling brightly I wish you a happy 18th birthday what did you wish for just now come on tell everyone he winked slightly and said a wish that is spoken will not come true she excitedly hugged him tightly don't keep us in suspense please tell us their parents sitting beside them also laughed and teased fay fay don't make it hard for your brother that's right he's already an 18-year-old man shouldn't we let him have some little secrets he shyly exclaimed men men you know he cleared his throat scratched his nose and smiled brightly if you want to know then I'll tell you I hope our family will always be like this happy and joyful before he could finish his sentence a sudden slash pierced through cutting his sister directly in half the blood of all three people gushed towards him like a flood leaving him Frozen in shock at that moment the entire city was engulfed in flames the sounds of explosions from various objects the crashing of buildings and the Thick Smoke Rising swirling around their parents and sister fell from the roof of a building down to the ground he hurriedly called out father mom yanf but he could only feel helpless as he watched his family members die one by one before his eyes suddenly a large creature approached leaving him in shock it roed loudly causing him to be terrified ah hearing the scream his classmates all turned to look at him still dazed he realized it was just a dream the teacher angrily shouted vwoo was it my history class that was so boring or did you understand everything if so come up here and explain to everyone what the Earth o era is Yu scratched his head quickly explaining I'm sorry teacher I stayed up late studying last night so I wasn't careful Yi Wu intended to continue answering the teacher's question sir about the Earth o era the teacher immediately cut in all right you don't need to say anymore stand at the back of the class to wake yourself up ye W obediently follow the instruction at this moment the teacher also broke out in a sweat muttering to himself almost forgot this y Woo is really a good student luckily I'm smart enough otherwise I would have been embarrassed by him having said that he continued the lecture you all must take careful notes this is a mandatory part of the exam the teacher performed a few actions on the screen and immediately a reflection of the earth appeared he explained the so-called the Earth o era began in 2036 when the sky suddenly became chaotic turning the entire Earth into a game filled with dangers thus this era is called the Earth o era which is the era we we are living in now he continued apart from the demon Beast that can appear at any time humanss also have levels that can be increased and evolved into various professions abilities and skills after the first Evolutions eventually the demon beasts were suppressed by the five major lead towns and a new world order was established our yiu yiu is currently in grade three he stood at the back of the class listening to the lecture while pondering indeed in this era full of risks anyone can risk their lives to raise their level as for me after class thousands of students poured out but a loud voice attracted their attention why woo stop right there y Wu turned around puzzled L Fang what do you want the big blonde guy L Fang who was at level five raised his fist to threaten are you still pretending to be innocent it's time to pay this month's protection fee ywu crossed his arms and calmly said L Fang two years ago you were bullied by seniors and made to pay protection fees at that time I protected you now you come to collect protection fees from me Lu Fang did not hesitate lunging forward and punching ywu straight in the stomach it's me who's blind I thought I made friends with a genius you came into this school as a level three fighter but it's been 2 years now and I've Advanced from level one to level five while you're still at level three you're worthless absolutely worth worthless he pressed y Wu's head down to the ground constantly cursing you are a worthless piece of trash a worthless person who can't level up he laughed loudly just about to say more when suddenly a voice rang out stop what are you doing to my brother at that moment a powerful kick struck Lu Fang knocking him far away Lu Fang's minions were startled to see who had arrived Dam it it's y Yan Fe even though she's only 16 y Yan FEI is already a level seven fighter it said she once defeated a level 10 demon beast when she was at level seven she growled get out of here now the three bullies panicked and fled in disarray boss let's go Yuni is not someone to mess with as they ran away they turned back to taunt y Woo you're worthless just hiding behind a woman don't let me catch you alone again yanf stood with hands on hips and shouted what did you just say ye W sat on the ground and upon hearing this his face darkened he fell silent only using his hand to wipe the dust off his face Yun Fay turned back reassuring him don't listen to what they say although you only have a high school education you will definitely become the strongest fighter Yu put his hand on Yan's head and smiled silly don't worry your brother won't give up easily letun go home yes yanf replied on the way home Yu couldn't stop thinking that's right I'm a worthless one who can't level up I've searched through all materials and I've never seen a case like mine am I really the only worthless one in the earth o era no I absolutely will not give up upon arriving home his parents and yanf came forward with a cake to celebrate sh wo happy birthday brother happy 18th birthday Yun Fay exclaimed cheerfully the wishes made yiu even more determined I still need to protect my family protect my happiness I must become a strongman suddenly yiu recalled the dream he had this morning which startled him wait the birthday and the danger how could they coincide like this that nightmare can't become a reality I don't want things to turn out like they did in the dream Yu suggested how about we eat at a restaurant instead of at home parents it's been a while since we had Mr Le fish Hot Pot on lindu Avenue I suddenly crave it his mother grumbled I've already prepared food Yu's father spoke up in support come on leave that aside today is xia Wu's birthday let's indulge in for a meal Yeun Fay exclaimed joyfully awesome the whole family went out to eat and happily returned the little sister with a satisfied belly said Woo I'm so full at that moment ye woo sighed in relief thinking to himself nothing happened it seems I was overthinking suddenly a flash of lightning struck Yun f and a loud explosion echoed Yu's father shoed his wife and children from the ruins a large Circle appeared like a door connecting to the vast Universe yiu was astonished is this a PL crack the people present immediately started to flee in panic shouting it's over the monsters are about to appear quick scatter and inform the Defense Forces at that moment a gigantic spider crawled out of the circle causing even more terror among the crowd they shouted loud L damn it how can there be monsters in a safe Zone run away if it looks at you you're definitely dead at the same time the spider also known as the ghost ey demon spider of level 15 charged straight towards Yu's group I'm done for Yu's father saw the danger and without hesitation charged forward he turned to instruct sha Wu F protect your mother run quickly y Wu Panic stricken at the sight of his father rushing in hurriedly called Dad come back Yu's father prepared to unleash his attack I'm only at level 10 but I won't let you harm my family even if it costs my life I will temporarily hold you back he jumped up channeling his strength into both arms unleashing a series of powerful punches at the gigantic spider however these Relentless blows seemed to have no effect the demon laughed mockingly is that so too weak humans are inherently weak creatur creates it swung its legs striking directly at the father resulting in the direct Severance of both his legs causing him a scream in pain husband the mother screamed upon seeing her husband injured she instructed y wo and then charged forward sh woo quickly take fay fay away I will hold it off but before she could act the monster swung a powerful blow sending her flying far away the spider looked down on her with disdain its tone dripping with contempt eyesore Get out of the way soon it will be your turn the husband witnessing this was heartbroken but with his legs severed he could not stand up he called out to his wife in despair wife the gigantic spider next to her was still salivating licking its lips a level 10 human fighter The Taste must not be bad at all in a situation hanging by a thread two arrows suddenly flew in piercing straight into the spider's leg a voice echoed you vile cre teach if you're so skilled then come at me it turned out to be Yan Fe but her provocative action only drove the monster into a greater frenzy dare to provoke me die seeing that she had drawn the spider's attention y Yan Fe turned and said to her brother brother I will hold it down you quickly take our parents away however Yu was now very frightened his whole body trembled incessantly nightmarish thoughts seemed to materialize what should can I do I'm just level three and this is a level 15 demon Beast taking advantage of Y Yan F's moment of distraction the monster swung its leg striking fiercely at her left shoulder it licked its lips hungrily feel the despair before absolute power y yanf fell down clutching her wound her mouth moaning in pain the spider slowly approached mockingly saying just obediently become my meal young human girl you must taste delicious too under the tremendous pressure the spider exerted y Yan could only sit still despairing I'm done for my body can't move blood splattered everywhere as she said brother y wo rushed in from nowhere using both hands to support the leg of the monster he trembled and shouted loudly what are you waiting for go hurry up if you don't leave now I won't be able to hold it anymore even if I become its food at least I can before gu wo could finish his sentence another pair of legs charged from behind the monster and struck him directly block me are you enough yanf said in fear brother at this moment ye wuo had taken a fatal blow but still forced himself to shout don't worry about me go quickly after confirming that his sister had left the sounds of Moaning from pain finally came from y wo he continuously blamed himself if only I were strong enough none of this would have happened why can't I level up why am I so weak I'm not reconciled I'm not reconciled at this moment the constant beeping began to ring out the monster clicked its tongue disdainfully saying a level three trash Dar is to block me I'm not even interested in eating you get lost suddenly a strange voice echoed from Yu's body the experience the host has accumulated has met the standard the king the count system has been activated because the host has currently lost the ability to move the system will randomly select a k account the system is randomly selecting a k account it turns out that was the voice of the system the legendary Golden Hand of Y Wu and the Kan account the system chose for him was Emperor Chyenne gun Fe was running while regretting that she had left her brother behind she murmured I'm sorry brother I'm sorry the monster still would not let her go it leaped in front of her laughing coldly want to run didn't you want me to eat you I will satisfy you she spoke while crying her heart aching he sacrificed himself and only exchanged it for a little time is that all Yun Fe was cornered despair filled her as she decided to fight the monster to the death if I can't escape then even if I die I must take revenge for my brother suddenly a familiar voice rang out get out of the way yiu rushed in with lightning speed accompanied by dazzling rays of light he he punched the monster hard causing it to fall to the ground yiu stood up surrounded by brilliant Flames Yan FEI couldn't believe her eyes brother is that really you she panicked and quickly tried to stop him brother hurry a loud explosion echoed from the ruins as the monster madly charged toward guwu it roared impossible a mere level three human dares to challenge me let me see what you can do Yu Crouch down his hand raised accumulating power into a sharp spear he activated the skill sword come to me then he charged forward at a break neck speed fiercely stabbing into the gigantic monster it couldn't believe its eyes screaming in pain no you're clearly just a level three fighter how do you have such tremendous power suddenly Yi Wu felt something was off with his body he quickly stepped back coughing cough cough it feels like my body is about to break apart this overwhel in power has exceeded what my body can endure he kept coughing up blood seeing this the monster sneered is that all your battle power for 3 seconds humanity is so weak relying on the body a level three fighter you forcibly Unleashed such battle power I wouldn't even need to intervene you explode and die on your own Yu looked at his status panel pondering that's right my blood is almost depleted now I can only rely on this yellow bar before it runs out I must defeat this guy otherwise I'll definitely die noticing y wo couldn't last much longer the monster contemptuously turned away I have no interest in trash like you it took Master migration forever to help me open the teleportation Talisman of the safe Zone I need to take the time to devour some highlevel Fighters you can just wait here to die as soon as the words were spoken a fire Circle appeared blocking the path of the monster Yu gritted his teeth and shouted stop and die that was his explosive Health skill the monster bewildered thought W what that gaze and pressure how can it appear on a level three fighter at that moment a group of people rushed in and reported the reinforcements have arrived we found injured civilians and are starting rescue operations the target is a level 15 ghost eye monster we will proceed to eliminated immediately Yi Wu was surprised and quickly stopped them wait you all shouldn't go there to die but the group seemed skeptical as he was just a level three fighter one person in the group scoffed ignoring his warning die I think you're the one who will die don't think that just because a small level three fighter like you is wearing a Superman outfit you'll actually become strong get away don't be a hindrance here another person also spoke up even if there's a level difference we have the advantage in numbers a small difference like this isn't scary moreover its blood is is only at 30% oh is that so the monster murmured suddenly the ground beneath their feet cracked open gigantic webs shot up from the earth and snaring the group members and refusing to let go one of them panicked do me what is this spider silk we can't escape the monster was very excited at this moment it said its voice full of disdain I love this aspect of humans you don't know the heights of heaven or depths of the Earth yet you willingly offer your lives just obediently become my experience points just a bunch of newbies in no time the reinforcement team had their life force drained away you couldn't help but be astonished above the giant spider's head appeared the line of text indicating it had leveled up three times just leveled up three times in a row good at this rate it will be your turn to die at this moment the monster had changed slightly moving towards yiwu and delivering a punch forcing him to strouble to block it its Newfound strength made it even more SMUD how about it is my power different from before it continued demon beasts like us are different from you humans leveling up is incredibly difficult but out there it's rare to encounter humans of a lower level than us however just by leveling up an Earth shaking metamorphosis can happen therefore I've decided to First make you half dead then eat you haha yuu now in a passive position thought to himself its strength has indeed increased considerably what should I do my own strength is running out the monster laughed hardly continuously thrusting towards y woo mocking haha weren't you quite impressive just now so what now why do you no longer have the strength to fight back the Relentless lethal attacks bombarded guwu overwhelming him and sending him flying far away the monster laughed hardly haha worthless is indeed worthless in the moment of difficulty the voice of the system echoed detected that the host strength and health are below 10% the ultimate Red Storm is ready will you use it yiu staggered to his feet muttering 3 years have passed and because I couldn't level up I have been mocked and ridiculed by countless people today I will show you just how powerful the worthless in your mouths can be with that he raised his hand and sword gradually materialized from the air it was a killer move the ultimate Red Storm creating a fierce swirling ring of fire that cracked the ground and blew the gigantic spider away it screamed in pain aha under the impact of the Firepower the monster screamed in agony ah this is not a normal flame it also contains the rhyme of an emperor realm Powerhouse who are you really Master migration will not spare you as it spoke it slowly began to dissolve the system's voice sounded again defeated ghost eye monster received 20,000 experience points after confirming that the monster was dead you will lay down on the ground breathing a sigh of relief I'm alive but I need to quickly collect the equipment and items seeing his vision fading he strained with the last of his strength to reach for the items the sound of chimes from the system echoed continuously you have obtained 15,000 money one level 15 magic Crystal one ring of Lucky five poisonous spider silk and one gland of ghoste monster spider due to the host being severely injured 10,000 experience points will be automatically converted to heal wounds remaining experience points 10,000 healing in progress healing completed Health restored to 100% a flash of Golden Light startled Yu awake he wondered am I in the space of the system but this space is vast like the endless Galaxy completely different from my small system space what is going on the system space since the global change has given every player their own system space to observe and allocate their attributes as well as to collect equipment and items suddenly yugu saw something that left him incredibly astonished who is this person could he be the source of my power yiu said before him appeared the account Emperor chaien at maximum level Yu was extremely surprised unable able to believe his eyes Emperor chenne the system explained welcome the host to the king account system in this system there are countless the king accounts from various games and the host can use their experience points to unlock each of these the king accounts as the host has accumulated experience points to level 10 the system has automatically activated the account Emperor chai random hearing this y Wu couldn't help but feel delighted level 10 so the effort of 3 years has paid off but being forcibly absorbed by the system is the maximum level the king account with this wouldn't I be rising straight to the top while Yi Wu was still lost in self-adoration the system continued to explain although Emperor chaien starts at the maximum State the host still needs to use experience points to increase the connection level with the account the higher the connection level the more power the host can unleash from the account it is recommended that the host quickly earn more experience points to increase the connection level this statement immediately extinguished y Wu's thoughts he exclaimed oh my God indeed there's no such thing as a quick rise to power I was thinking too much but right after that he reassured himself however with the abilities of the account Emperor chaien earning more experience points shouldn't be too difficult even so yubu still felt a bit worried but even that may not be enough this world has many known and unknown instances ye W continued while force is the foundation it cannot resolve all issues we must quickly think of a way to utilize this system in the most optimal way introducing Emperor Chyenne the max level strowman from another world who led his Clans using the power of Chyenne to unify the world becoming the Supreme Being and was designated as Emperor Chyenne by his descendants max level link level 10 attributes of inflammation and darkness basic weapon with inflammation attribute basic skills include inflammation blast flame prison level 10 Yuan real fire level 10 explosive fire dragon wall level 10 fatal skills with inflammation attribute include limit kill level 10 red flamestorm which has not been unlocked dark attribute skills are not unlocked yet hearing this you will suddenly realize the attribute distribution account that's right after the o ER of the Earth the mutual generation and restriction among the attributes have become crucial so ywu became somewhat excited I have identified my first Target quickly level up unlock as many accounts as possible and create an army of Kings with all attributes this way there won't be any issues regarding attributes at that moment the system displayed a message you have 10,000 experience points remaining in the system you can choose to increase the link level of the account or unlock other supported skills ye W thought without hesitation it's time to upgrade the link the Urgent thing is to enhance survival capabilities and unlock some skills account everything else can wait the system notified confirmed suddenly a stream of light wrapped around his body and the system announced account link level increased by two now at level 12 ye Wu felt excited this is it I feel full of fresh energy could it be that my attributes have also increased he hurriedly checked open attribute panel damn it why am I still only level three is this forcing myself like a pig to eat a tiger before he could process this surprise a familiar voice rang out why we need so much money Yu was startled turning around that voice fay fay he opened his eyes and realized he was lying in an unfamiliar bed Yu sat up and scratched his head is this a hospital at that moment he noticed my body not only has it restored blood volume but even the wounds have healed but just thinking about the 10,000 experience points wasted makes me heartbroken outside loud arguing could be heard doctor are you kidding why is the treatment fee s High someone else said f Fay don't get agitated your wounds haven't healed yet ye W secretly rejoiced great everyone is fine but from the tone of their voices it seems like their situation is not good outside Yun Fe was arguing with a doctor even if the hospital provides us with high-grade recovery medication it can't be 500,000 the doctor feeling helpless tried to explain wait can you let me finish don't you all understand the situation a family of four all of you were affected by the deadly debuff from the monster and you must use special medication and undergo long-term treatment to fully recover of course you can choose to recover on your own but you will have to live in a long state of weakness though it won't mean death but the two men are not as fortunate if you don't use the medication your father can only last a month at most and your brother won't survive a week you should consider it and decide at this moment y yanf felt despair her emotions causing her to cough incessantly her mother reached out to support her and said fay fay don't be anxious I will think of a way regarding the money if it doesn't work we can sell a house the doctor know noticed this and quickly advised against it you're still weak don't get overly excited at that moment a voice suddenly rang out no need to sell a house it's the root of our family the three looked at Yu in Surprise Yu continued my parents have worked hard for half their lives to get this house no matter what we cannot sell it for the treatment costs I will find a way to earn enough quickly the doctor couldn't believe his eyes patient how can you you clearly have a life threatening injury yet you can still she said brother why did you get out of bed cough cough y wo hurly supported his sister and comforted her I'm fine don't talk anymore fay fay you'll make the illness worse the doctor beside them was still puzzled this how did the toxin in your body disappear you were the one who suffered the most severe poisoning and injury among the four how can you recover so quickly yiwu didn't answer but got straight to the point the cause doesn't matter what matters is that I no longer need treatment besides me how much is the treatment cost for the other three the doctor replied 300,000 each the doctor still found it hard to understand secretly thinking this kid is unusual on the surface he only has a high school education but his recovery speed is faster than anyone at level 60 I ever seen youu seem to be contemplating something 300,000 although this is indeed a large sum of money after thinking he grabbed the doctor's hand and promised all right please treat them give me 1 hour I will quickly earn enough for this 300,000 the doctor had a slight disbelief 300,000 in 1 hour although I find that nearly impossible as a doctor I agree to give you 1 hour thank you Yu replied after leaving the hospital he sat on a nearby bench opened his status panel and began to ponder I have always had a habit of saving money but even with the money earned from killing the ghost ey monster it's still not enough for 300,000 the fastest way to make money now is to sell props or equipment hu took out a red Crystal from the space the most valuable item in my space is this level 18 rare Magic Crystal I hope it can sell for a good price the level 18 rare Magic Crystal can be traded which further explains magic crystals after defeating monsters there's a certain probability of them dropping they are the basic material used to create Magic equipment with higher levels being more valuable yugu pondered if I auction it officially I might get a good price but that would take too much time and 1 hour is simply not enough furthermore auctions have level restrictions as a level three fighter I have no right to participate after a while of thinking he stood up and walked into a narrow alley I've heard that in safe zone no nine there's a place where anyone can trade freely regardless of their level Yu continued the underground Black Market the value of items in the black market is secretly manipulated by large groups which can be sent to be a mixed place if it were in the past I wouldn't have been able to come here alone but now it's different as soon as he approached the door Yu was blocked by two tall men one of them said stop what are you doing this is not a place for little ghosts to come and play where did you come from get back there do you even know where this is that you dare to barge in ye woo unfazed replied of course I know no one comes to the black market to play I'm here to sell Goods isn't this black market open for anyone to trade freely one of the guards sneered selling Goods haha we don't accept stuff from kids around here get lost Yu slightly annoyed said if I'm brave enough to come here then I definitely have good items please step aside I'm in a hurry the other guard hearing this became angry and lunged at him grabbing his shirt and shouting what could a little kid have that's any good get out of here I don't have time to play with you just as a fight was about to break out a voice rang out wait this brother here is not wrong we open the door for business all for the sake of profit as long as there are good items everyone can trade freely from inside the building an old man with a cane stepped out upon seeing him everyone had to Bow their heads yes yes Elder lie he stood on the balcony stroking his beard and asked loudly I wonder if this brother has any good items to show me for my Enlightenment y Wu joyfully replied finally I have met someone I can have a normal conversation with he quickly took off his cloak and pulled out a magic Crystal I wonder if this item of mine would catch your eye the old man was a bit surprised this is a RAR level magic Crystal I didn't expect that a level three person like you would possess such a thing this transaction action will require further discussion saying that he raised his hand and commanded The Bodyguard next to him let him in the door was open unlike the simple appearance of the building the interior was vast and luxurious this was the underground trading Hall of the black market as Yu walked in he looked around constantly evaluating is this really the legendary Black Market it's completely different from what I imagined it looks more like a bar suddenly a beautiful girl waved her hand in greeting not forgetting to wig at him she was probably a staff member here Yu was somewhat surprised it seems the boss has quite the strategy getting buyers drunk to spend lavishly suddenly a large hand rested on Yu's shoulder holding him back hey he mocked a little kid from high school dares to come to this place it's milk drinking time oh hurry home and find your mom haha the other guy chimed in surely the little kid came to sell something to get for snacks right let go take a look at what Treasures you have be good at that moment a bodyguard approached grabbed the hand of the fat guy and warned get lost this is Elder Li's guest if you dare to disturb do you want to die they had no choice but to let y Wu go but one of them still felt uncomfortable and muttered Tex relying on being a representative of Wong Jen group causing trouble here Elder lie isn't exactly a good guy this kid I fear the guy next to him quickly spoke up to stop him keep your voice down are you asking for trouble in the VIP room of the black market when elder Li saw that yiu had arrived he raised his hand in greeting brother you've come please sit thank you yiu replied as soon as he sat down the old man went straight to the point let's skip the small talk business should be straightforward but there are a few things I need to clarify the magic crystal in your hand is indeed good stuff but it's only level 18 after all therefore the price not allowing him to finish his sentence y Wu immediately interrupted therefore right from the start you pressured me on the price if we're doing business we should be straightforward can we cut down on the tricks and add a little sincerity although I only graduated high school I'm not a child I can tell whether something is valuable or not just give me a number I'm in a hurry Elder lie with a contemplative expression smiled and said haha interesting little brother although you may not have a high level your aura isn't weak if it's an ordinary magic Crystal it's only worth 1 or 2,000 for your rare Magic Crystal I'll offer you 100,000 ye woo smirked 100,000 haha truly a cunning Fox is not a businessman do you really take me for a child even if the price in the black market is lower than auction this magic Crystal of mine is worth at least 200,000 you offer 100,000 sorry I think I should find someone else who can offer a higher price after saying this he prepared to leave but was blocked by two large bodyguards the old man loudly threatened it seems you have misunderstood little brother now that you are here whether to sell or not is not up to you moreover no one has dared to refuse something that the Hang Jen group has set its sights on he anxiously speculated is this a preparation for a robbery or a fight this is the black market where anyone can act at will using the emperor chaien account should allow for an escape but he calculated the situation even if I could Escape causing chaos wouldn't benefit me furthermore I can't even hold a single penny I'd only delay the treatment for fa Fe and my mother the man threw a stack of money before him this is 100,000 for a little kid like you it's a large amount I advise you to be smart take the money and leave if not he threatened he couldn't help but worry thinking is there no choice but to accept I never expected to encounter a situation requiring violence so soon damn it I wonder if there's a top tier wealthy account in the system in this moment of peril suddenly a voice appeared from nowhere oh the esteemed Guang Jen group is actually oppressing a high school kid what a disgrace the unexpected appearance of another person caught the two bodyguards off guard one mask individual with a character s had silenced the two bodyguards ordering get out from nowhere a beautiful girl with ideal body measurements appeared I heard there are delicious things here so I came to join the fun that was none other than moai level 20 he looked at her his tone humble so it turns out to be Miss Mo of hanm Mo group why you have the interest to come to such a chaotic place and even snatch the business of this old man miss Mo squinted her emerald green eyes her voice low snatch don't say it so harshly it's a rule of equal trading whoever offers a higher price gets it in the black market you've been around long enough you should know better than I do her words made the old man Ponder thoughtfully Yu recall Moy I think I've heard that name before Miss Mo leaned closer to Yu tempting little handsome I'm very interested in your rare Magic Crystal I'll offer 300,000 sell it to me hearing her offer Elder Li shouted what 300,000 this guy just offered 200,000 and you raise it to 300,000 what do you mean she smiled and replied I have money so I'm just being Whimsical I'm not like your hang Jen group she continued even the stuff from a high school kid is something I want to take spending 100,000 it's enough to make hang Jen group lose all their face this deal I think it's worth it provoked by her mockery he angrily said you then he turned to leave seeing him walk away Miss Mo cheerfully waved goodbye take it easy Elder lie if there's ever something like this again remember to call me he pondered the relationship between the two groups I've heard that the Hang Jen group and Han Mo of safe Zone number nine are always at odds I didn't expect to witness it today and thanks to that I've actually gained some benefit if she has that much money why not after all she was the one willing to let a hand to save him so it was only natural for him to thank her thank you beautiful I still have some other items I wonder if you're interested but before he could introduce them she interrupted him no and you don't need to thank me I just seized the opportunity to humiliate Wang Jen your matter has nothing to do with me you just happen to be within my line of sight having said that she casually handed over to her subordinates and confidently walked away you give the money to that little kid as for how to deal with the magic Crystal you all decide you can throw it away if you want The Hired Hand heard this and bowed his head obeying yes eldest Miss he looked at her with interest haha truly a proud eldest Miss no matter what I will remember this kindness at the same time in the emergency room of the hospital a man was unconscious and had to breathe using oxygen the data on the monitor did not seem very promising the daughter seeing the situation worriedly asked the doctor doctor how much longer does he need treatment the doctor reported the current situation is very hard to say just then a bald man appeared shouting I heard that these poor ghosts haven't paid the hospital fees yet why are they still here the doctor replied director they have paid for the emergency treatment as for the hospital fees indeed the man referred to as the Director angrily grabbed the doctor's shirt what are you doing we opened a hospital not a charity these people still haven't paid for their medicine the doctor weakly responded but their son said he went to earn money shouldn't we wait a bit longer a slap like lightning struck the doctor's face the director shouted wait is there something wrong with your brain a level three fighter and a little kid at that where would he borrow 300,000 the other person said trembling this the director turned to Yi Yuni and said this nutrient treatment is rare selling your parents wouldn't fetch this price want to cure them she anxiously pleaded director please wait a moment my brother is coming back with the money he was just waiting to pull the respirator from her father shouting gather money the only Hospital in this safe Zone isn't for the common class to pay for if you don't have money then go home and wait to die she worriedly blocked him crying out don't he angrily reached for her injuring her in the process at that moment Yi Wu burst in kicking the door open cooly he called loudly fay fay then he shouted stop seeing this the director grabbed his shirt threatening who are you dare to break the hospital door pay me for it he couldn't back down his anger reaching its peak did you use that arm to harm my family just now the director's hand suddenly burst into Fierce Flames he stammered in fear this this is saying that he ran off yelling loudly ah my hand what's happening where's the fire extinguisher somebody hurry treat me a doctor worriedly asked him what did you do to him why did his hand suddenly Catch Fire he calmly replied although he has the authority to drive us away he harmed my family I cannot accept this this is just a small punishment don't worry I'll provide an additional 10,000 consider it for medical expenses completely different from the 10 attitude earlier he happily said if he were also a good doctor with the same ethics as this doctor nothing would have happened the doctor heard this and stammered that is of course in his mind he was secretly pleased that director deserves it relying on being the principal's Uncle while being rude only concerned about his own interests many colleagues are also uncomfortable with him today is his retribution he will think twice before acting so viciously in the future he handed the doctor doctor a card and asked this has 310,000 in it can it be used for my family to continue treatment the doctor replied of course don't worry our Hospital may be expensive but we are definitely not fraudulent your family will receive the best treatment he expressed his gratitude saying thank you doctor I am willing to trust and give me time to gather the funds I owe you a favor the doctor smiled no need to thank me this is what a doctor should do he Sil thought besides being able to heal debuffs this kid can also gather 300,000 in such a short time interesting after the doctor left only the two siblings remained ye woo and Y Yun Fe cried harly blaming themselves I'm sorry brother I didn't protect our parents well if it weren't for me being in such a weak State he patted her head to comfort her no need to blame yourselves silly it's my fault for not returning in time that caused everyone to suffer don't worry anymore her Amber eyes were filled with tears damn it if I hadn't been hit by this debuff I could have participated in the dungeon competition of the academy tomorrow I was planning to win used the prize money to improve our family's life but now I can't join won't get the prize money and I still owe 300,000 her words made him suddenly remember he shouted out in Joy the dungeon competition it's the dungeon competition that the school organizes every year I've heard that the prize money is very high she was still downcast yeah that's right I've heard that this year's prize money has increased to 500,000 I've been preparing for it for a year he shouted loudly 500,000 KN he about such a large prize ye wo was filled with a winning Spirit he confidently said to his sister fay fay you just focus on your treatment leave the money matters to me he wore a Victorious smile secretly thinking this prize money is definitely in mine the next morning at the Academy many people had already gathered in the auditorium the principal's voice rang out with excitement everyone welcome to the dungeon competition held once a year at the Academy surely the news about this year's prize money has spread around the academy raising his voice he shouted I want to tell you all that the rumors are true this year's prize money has increased to 500,000 depending on the level of completion of the instance there will be additional rewards his statement ignited a fiery atmosphere everyone enthusiastically shouted yes that's amazing the principal continued so why is the prize money so high this year he paused to build suspense among the crowd then announced that is because we have received sponsorship from hanm Mo group let's give them a round of applause standing next to him was none other than Moi mini with her stunning alluring figure radiating the aura of a distinguished young lady along with a group of followers the the crowd once again shouted loudly the atmosphere felt like it was about to explode there that is the Harris of hanmo group so beautiful someone else exclaimed the dazzling glow is overwhelming just looking at her makes my heart melt not stopping there the principal continued to stir up the auditorium by announcing a shocking news the winner of this competition can directly enter the mo attack team of hanm Mo group as expected this news ignited the fervor of the students every one excitedly shouted Mo attack team that is the team ranked 10th on the dungeon score list oh my God compared to the prize money this is the greatest reward being in the mo attack team means getting closer to the Pinnacle of one's life unlike the ordinary boys Yu was deep in thought I have heard that the competition among the teams of various groups is extremely Fierce the eldest Miss is looking to select talents from the academy is she being too hasty but that has nothing to do with with me my only goal is the prize money while everyone else aspired to become members of the mo attack team his gaze remained Resolute with a singular aim that is the prize money of 500,000 the principal declared so the dungeon of this competition is on the stage images of be withered trees appeared everyone was surprised by this dungeon what I never expected it to be the Shadow Forest this is the highest level dungeon of the academy moreover no one has ever successfully cleared it unlike their initial excitement the students faces turned pale they gaped the average level of our students is only level five isn't it a death sentence to go in there Yi Wu was only curious about the final boss of the dungeon quickly he got the answer that is the level 10 Shadow dryad predictably some people muttered aloud indeed it's a level 10 Elite who would dare to go another student despondently exclaimed I knew it no Academy would provide us with such benefits for free they are certainly not Ordinary People Yi wo with a face full of excitement for this challenging test confidently thought level 10 Elite Shadow dyed he confidently reflected it's just right for me the principal continued to explain don't rush this dungeon is indeed difficult and the mode also has a dual mechanism of PVB and PVE for this reason the competition will allow a maximum team of five people like a drowning person grabbing onto a pole the atmosphere suddenly returned to its Lively State as before team up doesn't that mean we can cling to the legs of geniuses if we can Team Up defeating the level 10 Elite Shadow drad won't be difficult at all but then everyone suddenly realized but there is also the PVP aspect doesn't that mean even monsters will have to fight over it and we have to guard against being ambushed too Yi Wu pondered thoughtfully team up plus the two forms of the dungeon the school wants to train real Combat and survival skills here suddenly someone raised their hand to volunteer to speak principal what will happen if a teen wins the wise principal explained haha there will definitely be quite a few students with the same question as you the competition is about individual accumulation but the accumulation from the shadow dryad will be shared according to the team the principal added the higher the accumulation of the Shadow dryad Victory will only occur within the team's strategy there is no personal Victory but you can still go and experience it the principal enigmatically stated moreover to allow everyone to feel the battlefield atmosphere in advance in the PVP sector defeating another team can transfer their accumulation points to you the group of students realized this and shouted what that sounds too brutal isn't this encouraging them to slaughter each other the principal's dignified voice rang out now I officially declare the competition to begin a massive black hole appeared surrounded by Electric Sparks promising a Fierce and challenging battle yet also incredibly exciting a group of people gathered together to find teammates voices echoed level five Swordsmen seeking a team someone called out is there any brother who needs to bring someone along I am treated at level five here A bunch of unpleasant individuals surrounded and mocked Yu this is really pathetic oh my God how can there there be a worthless level three over here sha our school really is how can we still have this kind of trash shouldn't it just withdraw and go clean the toilets could it be that it's y wo the legendary one who can't level up hurry and leave watch out for it coming to find us to team up y wo paid no mind to the snear of those despicable people rest assured even if you ask me I won't team up with you I don't want add any burden acting alone is the most convenient y Wu then notified the registration lady standing nearby excuse me I would like to register she was curious to see that y woo was alone where are your teammates y Wu confidently replied just me please help me register seeing y wo seemed a bit complacent the girl in charge immediately urged but you're only in high school it's really dangerous to go alone why don't you think it over Yu didn't seem to agree with her advice much hay from somewhere a voice full of provocation and disdain echoed from behind Yu it turned out to be luu Fang that guy is really despicable a worthless one who can't level up living is just wasting air just ignore him let him go die y Wu unexpectedly turned around to look Lu Fang why are you here Lu Fang's companions came up from behind and judged y wo truly a case of like Master like pet a worthless high schooler how can she talk to our boss boss let me go teach her a lesson Lu Fang looked pleased wait no matter what she was once my boss can't we show some respect how about this if you crawl on the ground and bark for 2 minutes I'll take you into the dungeon to see what it's like Lu Fang's companions took this opportunity to mock yo haha our clever boss listen to this it's just too great bark quickly Yu showed no signs of being shaken by L Fang's oppression how is a dog bark Lu Fang answered of course it's woof woof the stick hits the man who wields it back and in an instant Lu Fang slapped himself in the face how satisfying realizing he had been played Lu Fang rushed over intending to give Yu a beating damn it you dare to mess with me I'm going to beat you to death before he could throw a punch he was stopped by the registration girl stop if you want to fight take it into the dungeon fighting here won't earn you any points ious Lu Fang walked away but didn't forget to leave a few challenging words vwoo if you're so tough don't hide I'll be waiting for you in the dungeon Yu showed no signs of being shaken by Lu Fang's words hide how do you write that that word doesn't exist in my dictionary the registration girl quickly intervened adding fuel to the fire you shouldn't say that anymore the confrontation between Lu Fang and Y Wu temporarily came came to an end all right so miss can you register me now seeing Yu's determination the registration girl decided not to stop him anymore while your courage is commendable ultimately we must rely on strength to speak if you stubbornly insist on entering then all I can do is wish you luck y Wu confidently responded yes thank you with an air of confidence yiu boldly approached the entrance to the dungeon thinking all right the show is about to begin the dungeon gate opened with an announcement congratulations to the host for successfully activating the first dungeon of their life earned a reward of 2,000 experience points from a distance moai spotted Yu M isn't that the guy I saw at the black market yesterday she must have also recognized yiwu's potential this guy is interesting only level three yet not only dared to venture into the black market but also Brave level 5 to 10 copies all on his own let's see what skills he possesses aside from being bold ke's followers voiced some doubts a level three fighter Miss do you really think he can win in this type of dungeon she appeared quite curious waiting to see what y Wu would bring to the table haha let's just sit back and enjoy the show yiu officially entered the dungeon before charging into battle uncertain of the outcome ahead Yu did not rush into combat but gradually made predictions the starting location of the dungeon is random to prevent different teams from gathering in the same place avoiding immediate clashes as soon as it starts this is quite convenient for my actions you thought using the fastest speed eliminate all the little monsters around and then consider my next move every little monster was swiftly eliminated by Yi Wu and the reward points continued to accumulate after wiping out the little monsters yiu realized that this process was taking too long so we had to devise another plan to speed things up the area of this dungeon is too vast and the monsters are quite scattered taking down the monsters will take longer than I anticipated to win I need to hunt highle monsters instead suddenly ywu saw the little monsters heading towards the forest but was unclear where they were going huh where are they headed curious about this yeu decided let's chase and see yiu became a bit careless and soon lost track of the little monster saying a bit careless I've run into the forest Yu was taken AB by the seene before him this is a girl was trapped in a red spiderweb and he said on this red spiderweb that girl is the girl was slowly waking up where am I before fainting I remember when she was fully conscious she recalled captured by the spider monster help help me someone saved me in a panic ye woo rush to rescue t tan if you want live be quiet fortunately tantan was saved and she said brother who are you ye woo quickly climbed up a branch near the spiderweb that was trapping tnen if you keep screaming like that you'll attract monsters I won't risk saving you like I'm doing now tyan was surprised to discover y Wu and knew a bit about his identity you are Yun fe's older brother yiu the one who can't level up she was scared but still tried to pretend to be concerned for yiu why are you here how did you end up in the dungeon you are only level three do you want to die just leave me alone and run away if the demon Beast comes back you will definitely die too yimu also noticed tyan you are fa's good friend right if she finds out I saw you in trouble and didn't help she definitely won't let me off the hook so just keep your mouth shut and wait Ty tan still thought y wo was just a weakling thanks for your kindness but stop being foolish after all you are only level three there's no way you can cut the spider silk of a level eight Elite Yu's hand burst into flames gradually burning a strand of the monster silk is that so it's just level eight Elite the entire red spiderweb was burned to ashes in an instant and T tan was finally saved you you can burn this spider silk I'm saved after rescuing tnan yiu did not forget get to remind her quickly leave here and find your team because it's not safe to go alone suddenly a slimy substance fell right onto Yu's shoulder what is that yiu jumped in Surprise and looked up but it was too late the level eight Black Widow Island spider had returned without him noticing he thought to himself I'm done for having just been rescued tyan tan was startled by ywu scream what's wrong what's happening the thick slime continued to fall from above Yu noticed and immediately jumped to push tantan away get back this substance is poisonous he thought he had narrowly escaped danger but unexpectedly both of them fell into the monster's web trap Yu realized this is the web it had set as a trap without us knowing both were in a difficult situation not easy to escape quickly what a blunder this is the hunting Instinct of the elite monster in this dungeon why is this girl here the spider's web continued to tighten binding the two together in this dangerous situation they could only wait for death Tian Tian panicked mumbling we're about to die it's over we're going to be eaten y Wu tried to reassure her stay calm if not the web will tighten more and more ye W thought to himself how unlucky he was damn it do I have a debt with spiders these days to be ambushed like this even though I have the can system system my practical experience is still too little this is truly deadly in the future I need to work harder While y Wu was blaming his fate tantan was terrified only able to scream waiting for death who I don't want to die here death seemed to be near unexpectedly the Black Widow Island spider turned and left surprising both of them T Tian joyously exclaimed oh why did it leave could it be that it found us unappetizing just as they breathed the sigh of relief y Wu suddenly spoke up like a bolt from the blue tan according to the behavior of the Black Widow Island spider after finishing its hunt it will lay eggs into the body of its prey using that as a nurturing place for its young it must not be full yet waiting until it's satisfied before coming back Ty Tian panicked and shouted Dum you what no way I don't want to give birth for it haa seeing her scared and struggling Yu couldn't help but worry he tried to reassure her hey don't struggle anymore that scene of fear was truly intense as both of them pressed closely together the web trap was getting tighter due to tant's frenzy crashing the more y Wu reminded tyen tin not to panic the more frantic she became he thought to himself damn it at this rate something is bound to happen we are both tied up too tightly if I forcibly use the flame power of Emperor ch an she will get hurt with no choice left y Wu pressed his face close to tant Tan's chest taking advantage of the situation while being forced tanan shouted what are you doing what kind of thing is this at a time like this ye W immediately halted tyan Tan's inappropriate thoughts stop imagining things if you want live don't squirm anymore Ty tan still didn't understand what Yu was doing when he bit down hard on the spider silk fortunately this spider silk is not poisonous and since it was just spat out it hasn't hardened yet using my mouth I can barely and slowly bite through it as he strugg to escape the spider silk trap tantan unconsciously let out a few strange sounds making it difficult for yo to focus don't please don't these sounds made Yu flustered and he snapped stop making strange noises it's throwing me off hurry bite along with me once the spider silk hardens we won't have any chance to escape tyen tyan froze when she heard yiu speak and only knew to follow along naturally a poetic scene unfolded leaving y wo a bit confused what is this strange atmosphere a series of foolish actions continued making both of them even more bewildered suddenly yiu shouted loudly when tanan bit him by mistake tanan could only apologize occasionally making some strange sounds that made the atmosphere even more Awkward finally after much effort they both escaped escaped from the spider's web what a relief tyen tyan said her voice still filled with fear finally finally rescued who in contrast y Wu immediately regained his composure and snapped now is not the time to let your guard down get up and run tan faint weakness but after going through all that my legs are too tired Yu frowned I told you not to say things that could be misunderstood suddenly some strange noises came from the forest y Wu immediately realize not good the Black Widow Island spider is back but this time yiu was not scared at all and walked straight towards the monster speaking to Tin you have your team right go find your teammates I'll handle it here tan quickly stopped ywu are you crazy you need to know when to choose your battles you're only in high school facing an elite level eight means certain death come run with me it seems that there is no word for running away in Yu's dictionary he smirked A Satisfied smile playing on his lips haha I'm not entering the dungeon to be a prey chased around my purpose is to hunt Yu's hand ignited with a fierce flame showcasing his confident and courageous demeanor he continued the debt from earlier I must collect facing a level eight Elite ye woo remain calm while tan fearfully shouted it's not good the Red Widow is getting closer seeing her so loud you w turn to remind her I don't care whether you leave or stay but don't obstruct me tyen feeling somewhat scared still decided then I will stay back to be your therapist after all I am a level five therapist as heu emanated a powerful Aura tan was stunned such terrifying pressure how can a level three person have this kind of Aura could it be that he has hidden his level this is scientifically impossible ye woo concentrated his strength forming a sword and gazing at the Red Widow is it you in the end you are just a spider let me unleash the anger from my family harmed by spiders upon you the Red Widow lunged to attack first but ye W effortlessly dodged he laughed oh you can't speak human language seems like you are far inferior to the ghost ey demon spider that's fine even better because I don't want to hear the pleas of my prey saying that Yu leveraged his power to LEAP into the air the blade sweeping powerfully and cleaving the creature's body in half Flames erupting fiercely at this moment tan was stunned by his display this attack power I can't believe he could kill a level eight Elite Beast she thought to herself it seems my guess was not wrong he indeed has the ability to hide his level the system announc Yi Wu has successfully slayed the Red Widow level eight Elite earning 1,000 points of raw points the assist points for the the kill reached 500 points congratulations to the player the kill outside the system has awarded 5,000 experience points tyen tyan couldn't believe her ears why do I get points too I didn't contribute anything is this really like in the Legends where you can reap rewards without doing any work Overjoyed she danced in front of Yu chattering away great God tell me how do you hide your level like that she continued to ask I told you I was already a level three genius when I entered the academy how could I be stagnant at just one level you definitely have your own plans right great God please tell me seeing yugu still keeping silent tyen Tian immediately climbed onto his neck yugu frowned and said let me go if you keep hugging me like this do you think I might make you disappear right now I'm regretting saving you yumu thought to himself besides the 1,000 reward points from the dungeon the King account system also rewards an additional 5,000 experience points this is truly wonderful but the secret about the system must never be revealed to anyone he bent down to pick up the loot and turned to tntn saying the points will go be you but you won't get a share of the loot I'm keeping everything okay tyen tan quickly replied of course not as long as the great God helps me earn points I don't need anything else yiu suddenly exclaimed that's upon seeing the notification from the dungeon guwu has obtained the loot broken Venom gland tough spider silk and the battle item Red Widow Fang with one usage chinan exclaimed that's terrifying Yi Wu thought to himself luckily although there are no equipment pieces this type of battle item is in high demand in the black market it can be sold for a good price immediately afterward the system announced the loop Red Widow Fang has randomly leveled up upgraded to Red Widow deadly Fang adding effects of blood loss poison weakness and the number of uses increased to three Yu was satisfied to see the item it can even level up right after dropping Yu suddenly remembered that's right the ghost ey demon spider dropped the ring the system notified airing of Lucky with it I will have a random enhancement effect for items he sighed inwardly this ring is truly powerful I didn't expect it to be a legendary class ring it can randomly upgrade items it's like finding a treasure with this ring I will equip myself like a tiger with wings I just don't know how the enhancement rate will play out at that moment tyen tyen tightly wrapped her arms around ywo and Yu frowned saying I advise you to have some self-respect don't cling on to people for no reason I am not a lecherous person T tan immediately replied no no I'm not lecherous it's just that I'm scared only next to the great God can I feel secure everyone in school says you are worthless but actually that's just a disguise right she continued to curiously ask what tools do you use to hide your level I'm very curious great God what level are you actually at y wo shook her hand off his tone serious things you should know don't ask I have my own calculations and reasons if you mourn be with me then keep quiet and keep this a secret from others if not his eyes were filled with killing intent causing tyen tyen to be immediately frightened falling silent and not daring to ask any more questions Tian tyan covered her mouth nodding her head rapidly mumbling um um um at that moment a voice rang out from behind oh isn't this ruin tanan you're still alive not eaten by the Red Widow you really have a great fate the speaker was Lon tnn's former team captain a captain with a score of three ,000 Tian Tian shouted loudly liong how dare you come back liong sneered why can't I I can go wherever I want besides you've been kicked out of our team a clueless idiot like you only knows about love and Magic what right do you have to question me if it weren't for the sake of our classmates I wouldn't bother bringing you into the dungeon with us hearing this tyen Tian angrily pointed at liong shouting kicked out of the team clear clearly you used me as bait for the Red Widow and ran away scared and what's wrong with love and Magic what right do you have to mock someone else's dreams liong laughed do you think of yourself as a magic girl I see you're beyond help suddenly one of Leong's underlings noticed that the Red Widow had been killed he panicked brother lie that's not right the Red Widow seems to be dead look it's being burned liong was shocked by her words what Red Widow is is dead it took me so long to gather my team preparing to go back and kill it Ruan T don't tell me you did this tyan ran over to Y Wu saying I teamed up with great God to take down Red Widow it still depends on whether you guys bow down or not you bunch of scumbags you were never a match for great God in the first place they mocked tant tan for saying that he is y wo the famous worthless one in the academy right this is the Great God you were talking about haha ruin T has your brain been burned by magic or something great God haha a team of Fools and workless people suited each other perfectly ttin tan felt like crying at their words you can mock me but you can't insult great God if not liong intervened all right all right just 1,000 points we can still earn them elsewhere but I'm sure Ruan tanan only got lucky to kill red widow there's no way I believe it was because of worthless ewo so at that moment the system announced liong invites you to join the team do you agree liong expressed disdain it seems you were still somewhat useful so if you want return to the team or not tianan angrily replied do you think I still believe your words liong smirked slightly this is an opportunity to win without effort don't be ungrateful being able to be a shield for us would be your greatest contribution moreover if you follow this guy you won't even know how you'll die later Ty Tian furiously said you guys have had enough don't insult the great God suddenly a strange sound burst forth tantan was so scared she clutched onto ye's arm how yelled ah that sound is terrifying the group led by liong showed interest is this the Roar of the devil tyranosaurus it's a rare elite worth 5,000 points I can't believe it appeared so close to us this gives even more points than the Red Widow just as they were about to deal with the monster Yu reminded them wait you think you guys can take down the devil Tyrannosaurus that's just looking for death liong shouted angrily damn it what are you saying Yi Wu smiled and replied I'm saying that with your current strength going over there is just sticking your teeth out for it I advise you to know your limits and not seek death lie young charged up to reprimand Yu I will deal with you first but his underlings immediately stopped him brother lie don't pay attention to this worthless guy if we wait a bit longer the monster will be stolen and then we'll be a loss before leaving he shouted a warning remember this ye woo we are not done yet tyan angrily shouted it's really hard to persuade a deadbeat the great God wants what's best for you guys when that time comes don't come back crying and asking the great God to save you after liong and his group left Fantan immediately suggested great god let's go around and take down little monsters with me here it will be easier you didn't say anything and just walk towards the devil tyranosaurus take down little monsters no no the map is too large the little monsters are too scattered we won't get much done to win just taking down little monsters isn't enough tyen Tien hearing this was a bit curious is that so then how you plan to do it yiu smiled and replied of course we will chase them down and become the ones to benefit switching scenes at this moment a piercing scream came from a corner of the forest an injured bird was running and crying out but just a few seconds later it was eaten by something the dinosaur dark red all over covered in sharp spikes was a level eight devil tyranosaurus the group of liong K behind the bushes and observed brother lie it seems the devil Tyrannosaurus has been fighting other beasts and has lost 15% Health looks like looks like we are lucky brother lie or should we just liong said we are four level five guys and we can't defeat a level eight Elite it is the only rare elite in this dungeon it has a lot of treasures on it are you telling me a give up like this damn it don't be afraid I'm the one scared here what are you afraid of killing it even if we can't loot the final boss it's enough to make it into the top 10 lion thought then I will go find that y w The Settle scores so Ruan tyen tyan can actively throw herself into my arms tyen tyen said brother Li you are truly courageous liong said worthless I have to let you know not everyone can pretend in front of me y Wu said boss I was wrong liong thought to himself feeling smug haha let's decide on that everyone then charged together let's go rally my spirits today I must achieve Victory together brother Le's dominance at that moment someone in the team noticed something strange no no brother lie I remember in the strategy for the devil tyranosaurus it was clearly dark green why has it now turned dark red liong said what did you say he replied the black and red color seem seems to be a berserk State could it be that it was provoked by the demon Beast before liong said damn it why didn't you say it earlier if it's berserk what are we going to do hurry up and run feeling the danger the three of them turned to flee but they were still a step too slow they were struck by the tail of the dinosaur in an instant two of them died and he shouted help the devil tannur breathed out a bright red flame incinerating the bodies of the two at this moment Leong's face turned pale second second kill liong said this this is indeed the berserk state of the rare elite too terrifying how could this happen all the hatred from the Devil teratosaurus is directed at me now but I still have faith in my speed after all I agile it means that one day if I can't fight back I can still run the monster hatred demon beast in the dungeon won't just disappear on its own as liong ran he formulated a plan I have to lure it to where there are people diverted hatred away from me the person closest to me is y woo so that works out perfectly haha you are going to receive this great gift from me y woo at this moment y wo and Tian Tian happen to be passing by liong secretly thought I found them I've almost run out of breath yet you guys are leisurely strolling around as if nothing happened tyen tyan saw him running back and felt a bit smug liong you really ran back LOM just smiled wickedly don't talk casually like that this time I won't come back empty-handed she said ha what do you mean liong said nothing and just ran quickly towards the two of them I brought you both a very special gift y Wu chuckled lightly there's no need to be so polite your score is the best gift already he thought to himself his speed is very fast he intends to launch a frontal attack but what about his team mates it seems there's something hidden in this matter lion ran past tan and shoved her forward towards the charging demon tyranosaurus I'll talk about it later go haha Titan tyan shouted loudly ouch liong yelled go see what kind of gift I brought for you too tyen tyan lost her balance and fell flat on her face it hurts lie on what do you want to do why so suddenly at this moment tan tyan felt a chill run down her spine as she turned around just in time to face the gigantic mouth demon demon tyranosaurus in moments of fear tyan tan casually cast a spell oh no don't come over here yiu shouted loudly idiot don't take the initiative to attack its hatred isn't on you after pausing for about 2 seconds tyen tyan suddenly realized it was already too late although she didn't harm the devil tyranosaurus she had instead provoked it who great God saved me liong wore a pleased expression haha someone who has never cleared a dungeon your performance truly doesn't disappoint me Ruel and TN on so how does it feel to team up with such a fool haha aren't you always claiming to be great at fighting I brought a big gift for the two of you you must be grateful my big move is coming I'll leave the rest here you don't worry after you two get torn apart by the devil Tyrannosaurus I will definitely have the kindness to pick up your corpses after saying that liong used a stealth spell making himself completely disappear ha Yu had a face full of murderous intent did I let you go Yu surprisingly grabbed liong by the throat making him very astonished although Ruan tnen is a simple-minded person she is still useful to me you on the other hand are worth even less than her the stealth spell was broken in an instant at this moment liong seemed to ye wool like a weirdo who spent all day doing things like what's going on clearly I have completely stealth how could you still see me Yu said it seems that your big move level is not high huh you only stealth but haven't completely disappeared so don't be surprised in my eyes you are just a heat signature liong said what you mean you can sense me through temperature how is that possible seeing the devil terar osaurus approaching he shouted vwoo damn it you quickly let me go that devil tyranosaurus has gone berserk at this rate we are both going to die Yi Wu laughed lightly is that so saying that he kicked liong down crushing the ground the red Flames surged along the cracks rapidly spreading toward the devil tyranosaurus Yi Wu quickly executed explosive hell and easily controlled the devil tyranosaurus liong having caused this but wanting to save his life had no choice but to kneel and plead this immense power oh my God you are worthless and cannot level up yet you possess this kind of power saying that he switched to a flattering tone a hem you just need a resonance point I don't care about how you equip your tools yigu found him flip-flopping and couldn't help but feel resistance form an alliance your thick skin exceeds my expectations but ask her she agrees liong shamelessly flattering sister ruin let's be class buddies you can join me in the dungeon time Tien who was scared away earlier rushed to hug y woo great God he's so intimidating My heart keeps racing seeing that she wasn't reacting liong held her leg tightly beautiful lady do you agree even if you don't want to team up with me just spare me please help me plead with Y wo tyan IGN ignored him and quickly demanded a scumbag like you doesn't deserve forgiveness lion pleed I used to treat you like a punching bag I was wrong give me a chance at that moment the devil tyranosaurus was tightly Bound by explosive hell Waring loudly it managed to break free from all of Yu's techniques T reflexively screamed not good great God the devil tyranosaurus has escaped from its trap what should we do he thought can it really use its Roar to break through the firewall and the destruction indeed it should not be underestimated liong had a Sinister expression pulling a weapon from behind his back right now it's my poisoned head this is my one hit kill skill useless y Wu go guy a scythe lunged straight down towards Yu's back but it was blocked by his sword liong was astonished when did you have a yiu replied his voice calm you still dare to sneak attack me at this moment is your hand only for show I was originally planning to spare you for your hard work and luring the monster for me without saying much yiu turned around and thrust straight through liang's chest liong screamed in pain ah Yu continued now it seems there's no need for that anymore he smiled at liong I accept your gift fully as soon as he finished a notification screen appeared yiu receives 5,000 personal and team points from liong on liong side the system also displayed a notification activating PVP protection mechanism player liong has failed in the dungeon preparing to extract from the dungeon liong angrily shouted V woo you bastard I won't let you go this isn't over a new notification appeared congratulations player ye woo receives stealth skillbook poison dagger the PVP mechanism is activated with the chance to drop items in equipment from the opponent which can be traded the notification screen displayed more details showing that two items had dropped Yu thought to himself lyong truly lives up to being a rich second generation having Quality Equipment even at level five as he pondered he checked the details of the items the first item was a stealth skill book when used this skill book grants players the ability to become invisible for 30 seconds with a 1-h hour cool down and this still can be upgraded the second item was a poison dagger a consumable weapon that has a chance to deal a critical hit against humanoid creatures but it only had one use left yiu was surprised and thought to drop two items at once this kind of situation has never happened before just then Ruan tyen Tan's voice rang out great God be careful a tyrannosaurus rexs charged toward guwu roaring with a Tremor Ru and tyen tyan shouted the devil Tyrannosaurus is rushing at you Yu turned around inwardly cursing this thing sure came quickly then he drove his sword and slashed at the Devil Tyrannosaurus thinking the devil Tyrannosaurus a specialty of the Shadow Forest is a rare type uniquely possessing fire attributes its characteristic is easily entering a berserk State once it goes berserk all its attributes multiply making it incredibly difficult to deal with he continued to call what he had read in books about berser creatures the textbook had stated when encountering a berserk beast in the wild or in a dungeon if you can't escape you must change your position and lie still on the ground this way you can depart without losing face but now just remembering he had to endure an attack from the devil Tyrannosaurus knocking him backward he told himself these things are no longer a problem for me the only hassle is if the devil sore is in a frenzied State even if defeated it won't drop any equipment or items thinking this he regained his balance ready to leap and attack it after being relentlessly assaulted by ywu the devil Tyrannosaurus shrieked in pain on the display the devil Tyrannosaurus level 8 has lost 25% Health seeing its Health recovery he thought that means the player has to both defeat it and ureer not to use too much force to explode it this mechanism is indeed challenging he paused gathered momentum and prepared to charge then silently thought fortunately I'm smart enough to leave some backup skills even though the devil Tyrannosaurus has gone berserk I still have ways to deal with it having said that he dashed towards the Beast the key to this method was Ruan tanon a loud explosion rang out as he charged straight into the chest of the devil Tyrannosaurus taking the full brunt of the attack it roared in anger and pain growing even more aggressive he quickly ran over to Ruan tianan and said listen to my commander quickly prepare a comfort for the devil Tyrannosaurus she looked confused not understanding anything and asked back Comfort noticing it growling and preparing to attack the devil sore breath fire aimed at incinerating ywu immediately ywu raised his shield to block the attack causing the Blazing Red Flames to split apart on either side while defending against its move he explained tyen Tian that's right it's the special skill of the therapists special skills you can use magic to eliminate the Rampage State get ready hearing him say this she was startled and panicked pointing at herself and saying while comforting can indeed eliminate the Rampage State I am of a different level than it so I can't be sure it will succeed moreover in a short time it can only be used once you Wu jumped to avoid the devil sores attack and said I'm not saying to do it now you should follow my command the devil Tyrannosaurus roared and Yu prepared his position raising his leg with force and charging towards it to attack while saying to increase the success rate I will bring its blood down to under 20% boom under Yu's attack the devil SAR was left with only 50% of its Health hearing this Ruan tanan quickly agreed yes yes in her heart she admired the great God this Incredible strength is hard to believe the great God can suppress a raging Beast relying only on a normal body this strategy can even compare to members of teams from large corporations the devil Tyrannosaurus rampaged swinging its tail towards Yi Wu he quickly focused his strength into his legs to stand firm blocking its attack without budging with his current skills he thought taking down a level eight raging Beast is easy but have to hold back when I strike if I'm not careful and end up killing it I won't get a single coin this kind of fighting really drives a person crazy ye Wu swiftly grasp the tale of the devil SAR cheerfully saying but who said you are a rare Beast your entire body is a treasure he embraced the massive tale of the devil SAR something that normally would be impossible for a single person to hold and exerted his strength to topple it as he thought he smiled now let's see what surprises you can bring me the devil Tyrannosaurus fell and at the same time the display showed its Health was down to exactly 20% he immediately said to tantan hurry this is the moment she quickly responded Yes Yes Ru raised her staff High chanting the spell the combination of beauty and wisdom the Incarnation of love and Magic In The Name of Love heal you with that she sent the magic sweet wind kiss toward the devil SAR Yu shivered and said do you really need to go overboard like this this heart-shaped comforting therapy is quite sweet isn't it the heart-shaped image flew towards the devil sore emitting an explosion that made the devil Tyrannosaurus lying on the groundh how seeing this yiu couldn't help but wonder what is that strange sound is it really Comfort or does it abuse noticing that the devil sore still showed no signs of being comforted he turned to Ruan tyen tan with a doubtful look you're sure you didn't use the wrong skill right Ruan tianan shly scratched her head and replied I'm pretty sure I didn't use it wrong at that moment the devil sore suddenly shrank down looking very cute seeing this she exclaimed happily oh my so adorable is this perhaps the true form of the devil Tyrannosaurus y woo feeling helpless replied who knows you completely thrown off the Rhythm ruin TNN puzzled asked him back you don't know about the therapist's special skills either is my comforting magic really supposed to work like this Yu approached the devil SAR and said all right let me give it one last hit score some points and gear up then we can go while the devil SAR was still confused about its small form tanan heard this and couldn't bear it seeing the shrunken figure of the devil Tyrannosaurus was too cute she quickly rushed over hubbed it tightly and said wait a minute the devil sore feeling melancholic upon hearing Yu's words shed tears in tan Tan's Embrace she quickly hugged it close Sheltering it and pleading with ewo great God could you not kill it look isn't it adorable moreover it is a rare Beast keeping it as a pet would be great as if understanding that TI tan was pleading for it the devil sore follow of suit putting on its most pitiable expression and looking at y Wu with a spoiled gaze seeing her suggestion he also thought it was not a bad idea but considering the points he would miss out on he reluctantly replied keep it as a pet seems like a decent idea however you will help compensate for my loss otherwise I'll kill you first to claim your points and then I'll take this Beast as a pet killing two birds with one stone sounds good at right upon hearing y wo's threat Ru and tan tyan broke out in a cold sweat without any hesitation she placed the devil sore in front of them the devil SAR looked bewildered still thinking she would protect it but no she had set it down and said I thought it over and I believe points and Equipment are still more important she released it in front of vwu realizing it had no place left to rely on the devil sore had no choice but to try to appear cute and harmless he looked up at him with tear-filled eyes his tail wagging lightly crying out Yu did not stop because of that raising his sword high and saying it's pointless for you to look at me with such innocent eyes surely you understand the rule of the strong eating the weak in this world better than I do the devil Tyrannosaurus knew he could not Escape his fate only able to shiver and cry as the sword plunged down yiwu quietly said humans and beasts are the same if you don't want to become someone's prey there is only one path left to keep getting stronger tinan witnessed the scene and could only stop the system then announced player y Wu has killed the Beast the devil Tyrannosaurus gaining 5,000 points player Ruan tyen Tian assisted in the kill gaining 2,500 points seeing she gained so many points Ruan tyan tan immediately stopped crying her eyes lighting up wow I didn't expect the points from the devil sore to be so high thank you devil sore y woo watching her Swift change could only sigh and think girls really are creatures that change easily the system reminded killed the rare Beast the devil Tyrannosaurus gaining 50,000 experience points the experience available for distribution is 750,000 would you like to distribute it now seeing the experience points accumulated like this y wo exclaimed in shock 50,000 experience the experience is even higher than that of the level 18 ghost eye demon it seems that the dungeon really has an effect on increasing experience he closed his eyes focused his mind and said enter the system account space stepping into the system space Yi Wu curiously thought to him self let me see aside from leveling up my connection what else can I allocate this experience to the system checked and then announced it has been detected that the player has a significant surplus of experience to optimize the use of experience the player can level up the Chen Emperor's connection to level 20 from there additional accounts can be unlocked the player can also choose to unlock other supportive skills of the chaien emperor to enhance the overall capability of the account after reading the announcement yiu considered carefully is it only at level 20 that I can unlock an account the Chen Emperor is already that strong I wonder what surprises the next account will bring me but I can't blindly unlock accounts now greed is not good I must use the experience to upgrade the Chen Emperor because no matter how powerful the attack is I will encounter opponents I cannot defeat I need the support of special skills combined with strategies to create more variations after calculating he said system open the special skills table upon receiving his command the system quickly presented the special skills of the chaien emperor the chaien Emperor of level 12 can unlock the following special skills camouflage also known as simulating the energy of a creature one tier higher than oneself for 2 minutes the cooldown time is 1 hour requiring 50,000 experience points to unlock the next skill is frenzied speed unleashing Flame to increase speed by 50% for 1 minute the cooldown time is 6 hours requiring 30,000 experience points to unlock finally there is true ey a skill that emits the true ey to scout All Creatures within a certain range the cooldown time is 1 hour requiring 70,000 experience points to unlock after checking the traits he exclaimed in shock OMG special skills are so expensive but looking back he realized they were very useful and necessary fitting with the amount of experience needed especially the against the sky eye this skill truly captured his attention ywu smiled and said but the true eye is a bit against the sky isn't it it essentially means that the map within a certain range is lay bare although it can only Scout creatures it's enough it could be just right to find the final boss hiding in the Shadow Forest you think 70,000 is just 70,000 having chosen the skill he needed he clicked to unlock true eye after confirming the system displayed a message 70,000 experience points consumed true eye skill unlocked with this special skill yiu was delighted he felt that there was a high chance he would catch and defeat the final boss he clenched his fists with confidence the final boss the shadow dryad is hiding very well and it hasn't been discovered yet he was still contemplating whether to give up or not but now with this scanning device why should I be afraid of not finding it the boss of the Shadow dryad is definitely mine now while he was satisfied Ruan Ty Tan's voice suddenly rang out she couldn't wait and had already opened her equipment great God he looked back startled and snapped out of the system turning to Ruan tntn he asked what are you looking at she placed her hand on his shoulder excitedly pointing to something glowing on the ground and said this this you need to look carefully from the blinding light on the ground exactly where he had just defeated the devil SAR yumu was amazed and exclaimed OMG Ruan tyan TI who let you open the equipment have you washed your hands yet Ruan tyen Tian mischievously responded he couldn't help it so I but that's not important what's important is this egg upon hearing this y replied in disbelief an egg could this possibly be the legendary one with an extremely low drop rate unable to answer the question the system instead displayed a teasing message unidentified egg this is a normal egg with a strange pattern on the outside you can try using your experience to hatch it or you could use it to make egg fried rice reading the systems notification ye Wu fell silent the corner of his mouth twitching as he remarked what is egg fried rice in contrast to Ruan TNT who was so curious that she leaned closer to the egg y Wu calmly thought if it couldn't produce a rare item like this could it be that Ruan T is extremely lucky unable to contain her excitement she exclaimed to him great this rare Beast egg I've heard can be nurtured into a fighting pet or mount with high destructive and combat abilities as she spoke Ruan Tian tan imagined the might of her great God after riding the devil Tyrannosaurus in battle she expressed I can already see the great God riding the mounts of the devil Tyrannosaurus so Majestic and imposing that it makes people's hearts race yiu found himself convinced thinking that does sound interesting notification y Wu has obtained the unidentified egg suddenly Ruan Tian tan moved closer to Yi Wu her round chest pressing against his then she whispered this is great great God finally I can contribute a little I've always been a hindrance to you I'm really sorry thank you for not abandoning me unfortunately the you be ski with him is nothing Yu turned his back and walked away saying to her but even so I'm not trapped this egg will not be given to you ruin Ting and tyen felt embarrassed and awkwardly explained because only the heavens know what you want why do we out of the blue aren't you saying everything is heartful great God don't misunderstand She hurriedly chased after ywu I don't need your proof great God wait for me the two were unaware that elsewhere someone was watching their every action and word outside the dungeon moai was monitoring the couple y wo and Ruan tyan tyin through a projector she said to the two subordinates behind her I guessed correctly this man indeed has some skills the devil tyranosaurus after all is not a match for him he doesn't appear to be just an average guy only stuck at the third level she turned to one of them and said please invite principal Yan To Me the servant immediately responded Yes young lady after sending that person to invite the principal m n turned off the projector and thought the dungeon surveilance system that La Lin's team just created is useful but it can only monitor low-level dungeons only when we can monitor mid-level and highlevel Dungeons and enhance our team's ranking can it be truly beneficial principal Yan bowed his head to greet M and asked Miss Mo did you call me for something moai leaned on the armrest of the chair tilted her body and asked him principal Yan what is Yu's ranking in the dungeon the principal seeing her mention y Wu questioned isn't y wo unable to level up hearing principal Yan say that she was surprised unable to level up please explain principal Yen placed one hand behind his back and the other hand over his mouth then said yeu entered the academy already at level three at that time he was considered a genius of the academy but three years have passed and his level has not increased we still don't know what the issue is after listening to principal yrion moai fell into silence level three he disguises himself very well what exactly is Yu's purpose I'm increasingly curious about him after M naai handed principal Yan the dungeon ranking list he was astonished unable to believe what he was seeing what y Wu ranks third how did he manage that moai calmly instructed Prin principal Yan and said principal Yan it's time to announce the ranking in the dungeon and conveniently reveal everyone's positions too upon hearing this he was taken back unsure of what she really wanted the dungeon was already challenging enough and now she wanted to publicly reveal the rankings it was truly ruthless also out of concern for y wo principal Yan said to her what is it Miss Mo are you planning to increase the difficulty of the dungeon but the mechanics of this dungeon are already brutal enough if the entire location is publicized the students will definitely engage in internos scene Strife especially y woo he is likely to be besieged M coldly and calmly replied to him without a second thought the real world is even harsher than this level 10 dungeon the talent that hanm Mo group wants to choose is the most outstanding one and adds for y woo he is not a simple as you think after hearing her say this he looked back at the list and fell into deep thought I didn't expect Miss Mo to have such a high opinion of Yu could it be that he really has some exceptional qualities it seems that we need to pay more attention to Yu inside the dungeon the Shadow Forest Chen Fang was severely injured the others also seemed to have been taken down by the opponents Shen Fang clutched his arm in pain shouting uh I can't believe you guys teamed up to kill other players how Despicable in front of him were two teams Lu Fang and Jan y joining forces to snatch points from other players L Fang disdainfully said Despicable this dungeon doesn't have a rule against forming alliances Chen Fang propped himself up angrily saying L Fang you he continued I am applying the rules reasonably if you don't want to Ally with me then go out of the dungeon and report to the principal after saying this he stomped hard on Chen Fang's back causing him to scream in pain ah the system then displayed a notification blue Fang has defeated Chen Fang's team earning 2,000 points Jong Yi the leader of the other team spread his hands and flattered L Fang is indeed brother Fang under your leadership our two teams are truly Invincible earning points is so easy Lu Fang grimaced and gritted his teeth I will become a member of the corporate battle team in the future if I can't handle even this little thing how will I survive later on boring defeating these trash isn't even that en enable if it worked for the points at that moment the system displayed a new notification that startled everyone one person exclaimed what is this display that the system has generated one of them continued the academy has publicly ranked the points from the dungeon and the positions of the players what is going on brother Fang Lu Fang arrogantly replied haha isn't it obvious the academy thinks we are not competing fiercely enough so they are encouraging us it suits me perfect now we can openly steal points from others haha in the notification system table the ranking list consists of rank one team Lu Fang 15,000 points rank two team Jong y 12,000 points rank three team ywu 10,000 points upon checking y Wu is also on the scoreboard causing him to angrily exclaim that ywu is still alive and even managed to get third place afterward he thought carefully how did you manage to do that was it just luck if you could reach third place merely out of luck then that's commendable but luck is run out now your points will all belong to me thinking this he raised his ax and shouted loudly follow me we're going to clear the battlefield and conveniently torment the useless y woo the map appeared and LU Fang along with his companions headed towards yiu the others also responded in unison yes on yiu side he was facing suen he fearfully ran deeper into the forest gasping for breath how did it come to this how did it turn out like this that guy is truly a monster a tree trunk exploded right in front of fen he startled and dodged then shouted ah he struggled to get up terrified looked back and thought to himself our team clearly went to Ambush him yet in the end he managed to fend us off by himself why is that just a level three use less person how could he have such power a blazing fire surrounded them causing suan to startle and look around then his retreat was blocked and a voice came from behind running away it was y woo and TI Tian two people right behind him in Yu's hand still lingered the remnants of the fire that had just cut off San's Escape Route Yu said I don't meet people either moreover didn't you want my points I'll be here waiting for you to kill me so don't be polite suan was Furious are you kidding my teammates have all been taken down by you do you think I would fall for your trick again sutin grimaced and quickly changed Direction charging towards y Wu damn it if I'm going to die anyway I will fight you yiu calmly replied clearly you all started at first so why make it seem like I'm the villain here he gently raised a hand and easily blocked xuan's punch it doesn't matter as long as I can earn points whether I serve as a messenger of evil or embody righteousness there's no difference having his punch block so effortlessly Jan Gast Yu Yi Wu nonchalantly snapped his fingers using the Yuan real fire technique and said to him next time remember bring more people suan had no chance to resist at all he cried out in pain ah the system notification appeared y w kills chuen gains 6,5 points for the team suan receives a basic recovery potion the system then displayed another notification activating forced pep protection mechanism transferring suan out of the dungeon Ruan tan tan quickly ran to yiwu she grabbed his hand tilted her head and with admiring eyes said as expected of the great God all four enemy teens were taken down by you truly amazing yiu squinted his eyes inside it's a Pity that these 14 te teams aside from points don't have anything valuable then he fell into deep thought again but the academy openly displays the rankings points and player locations this fits well with the young lady's style she originally intended for everyone to fight more fiercely but in the end she let me sit back and enjoy truly excellent support the system then displayed a congratulatory message for Yu's team current score is 22,500 points ranking first Ty tan joyfully jumped up and hugged Yu's back great God great God we are first this is amazing he stepped forward avoiding her ample chest all right got it now is not the time to celebrate don't let your guard down Ruan tyan Tian was still immersed in Joy Imagining the scene where the principal of the school raises the trophy and speaks in front all the students let us congratulate the genius therapists special skills Ruan tyen tan for achieving first place in this dungeon competition here is her medal and award just imagining it made tyan tyan smile with satisfaction Yu saw her overly excited expression and thought calm down with her score does she really think she can become a goddess if she keeps acting like this many people are probably starting to dislike her then he started the projection to check the movements of the remaining teams it looks like there are only three small teams left in the dungeon is the final fin moment approaching Ru and T tenen also leaned in to take a look and then asked him in confusion why are Lu Fang and Jang y always following us but not taking any action Yu replied calmly I know Lu Fang's personality too well although he appears Reckless he is actually very cautious after that yiu leaned in his expression serious and said he is hiding far away observing because my performance has exceeded his expectations he is not daring to underes imate the enemy and rush in once he calculates everything and is completely sure he will jump out to kill me and then snatch all the points Ruan tyen tyan was angry raising her fist and shouting how Despicable I've heard Yun F recount how Lu Fang has been targeting great Gods everywhere what on Earth is the reason for this great God ye W walked while observing the surroundings replying it's just a matter of what he once did to my underlings don't pay him any mind what we need to focus on now is to improve our concentration in order to find the final boss of the dungeon she heard him say that survey her surroundings and expressed her thoughts but I've heard that the final boss the shadow dryad has merged with the deep forest no one has ever found it the academy is using the Shadow Forest for the competition I fear they intend to let us use PVP to decide Victory and defeat right from the start then Yu turned back to her and said oh I'm a bit surprised that you can reach this conclusion on your own seeing the great God praising her Ruan Ty and Tin proudly placed her hands on her hips and said please don't underestimate my IQ just because of my beauty okay he found her so full of herself that he was momentarily stunned after that he said you're not wrong this dungeon competition is indeed testing our PVP abilities but I don't intend to give up on the shadow dyot boss after all there are plenty of gear an experience to be gained thus y Wu decided to use the skill true ey he raised his hand and said activate true ey the skill activated scanning the area around where he stood y Wu thought to himself indeed this is a special skill it cost me 70,000 experience points suddenly true ey opened wide found you final boss the shadow drad a brilliant wall of fire surged up around Yu with him at the center filled with fighting Spirit he silently admired the superior effect of the new skill in tracking down the boss's hiding place the special skill true ey truly does not disappoint it easily found the final boss hiding away whether in real life or in the dungeon powerful attacks combined with unique skills are the best this is exactly what I need then unexpectedly the Flames changed Direction causing him to be astonished the fire is leading me to the boss with his arms crossed in front of his chest once again he praised the extraordinary features of the system I didn't expect there would be a guiding function as well such considerate service it deserves a five-star rating suddenly an idea flashed in his mind he quickly dashed forward while saying with immense excitement letun go Ruan TNT on I found the final boss already we should hurry or someone else might snatch it away hearing the news she was so surprised that she couldn't help but be happy the final boss is so good great God however when thinking about this it's necessary to keep the information secure she couldn't help but advise him but great God could you be a bit more humble speaking so loudly what if someone else overhears it out of nowhere Lu Fang and his gang suddenly appeared from the bushes because the news was so shocking the whole group couldn't help but exclaim this Kido heu actually found the final boss on his own what a joke while in astonishment a voice that was rational and calm enough to warn everyone emerged but what if he's setting us up Lu Fang didn't think so and straightforwardly dismissed that possibility is this ye W teasing me normally so weak that I often tweak him now he seems to have transformed into a different person how could that be the remaining gang members still found it suspicious and thought it needed further consideration so they said but brother Fang you've seen it all four squads earlier were almost wiped out without a chance to fight back what should we do now should we keep following him brother Fang responded with a firm and Resolute answer from L Fang what else is there to say I have to join the Special Operations team their points absolutely must be acquired even if he has some tricks up his sleeve I will make him understand that pausing for a moment he let the whole team to follow making the confident and arrogant declaration I am not like that trash everyone follow me I'm going to take down both him and the boss the group quickly fell in line behind their leader shouting in udison yes yes unfortunately an unexpected incident occurred one man hurriedly reported not good brother Fang Yi Wu's signal has vanished luu Fang instantly erupted in Fury his face contorted with rage what's going on how can a living person just disappear when did he learn this kind of skill is he trying to mess with us the gang was thrown into chaos everyone panicking and seeking his orders brother Fang what should we do now everything is going off the rails L Fang became extremely enraged his eyes wide and fierce ordering his subordinates shift the target to another member of his team isn't there still a Ru on Tian Tian left surround her for me I don't believe he could just sit back and watch like a turtle pulling its head in you want to play I'll play with you ye woo in the middle of a dark cold Forest Ruan tanan anxiously called out vwoo great God stop joking around where are you this is not the time to go invisible feeling both vulnerable and terrified she was left with no choice but to wander aimlessly in search of Clues the great God had simply left behind a remark I need you to serve as bait before disappearing what does this mean does he want me to act as bait to lure Lu Fang and the others but they aren't foolish enough to fall for something so easily suddenly Lu Fang appeared in front of her with a fierce expression where is y woo everything was going against her expectations causing her to feel horrified what are you doing you just appeared out of nowhere and scared me to death without showing any sign of sympathy for her pitiful and weak demeanor Lu Fang insisted on getting answers don't pretend with me tell me where y Wu is hiding under the pressure of his intense Aura her voice trembled and and tears welled up from sheer fear but she still honestly confessed I really don't know he suddenly went missing from the map and I can't find him surely you must have noticed this on the map too but Lu Fang refused to believe her he pointed his ax at her warning and threatening stop pretending with me do you think I'll hesitate to chop you up she trembled all over I truly don't know at the same time she silently prayed please come out soon great God I've tried my best and I can't hold on much longer suddenly the ground shook violently interrupting everything everyone struggled to maintain their footing confused and panicked voices rose up what's happening is it an earthquake but little did they know that above them was a massive claw ready to snatch away the fragile lives in an instant the unfortunate lives were crushed lying helplessly beneath that terrifying claw three Unfortunate Souls screamed ah Lu Fang and the others could not react in time what's going on beneath the bright yellow Moonlight a bizarre and ghastly creature officially revealed itself its identity made the group exclaim this is the final boss the dungeon Shadow dryad overcome by its ferocious presence the lower ranked players trembled in fear eyes wide open in disbelief no way how could we be so unlucky we ran into a boss that no one has discovered yet we thought we just needed to rely on our people PVP points and that we would win for sure by just surviving Until the End how are we supposed to fight it now only Lu Fang reacted quickly raising his shield in front of him brle charging toward the danger he reassured his teammates while commanding the formation what are you panicking for the shadow dryad is only a level 10 Beast there are 10 of us quickly form up I'll hold its legs get your spirits together everyone yelled in response yes yes frustrated with Y wo Lu Fang nonetheless did not hesitate to throw himself into the battle against the boss although his Spirit was under immense tension he roared is this the goal that you littered us here for y wo fine I accept your grand gift wait until I become the first person to surpass the Shadow Forest then I'll slice you up to show my gratitude he leaped up with a fierce swing of his weapon sparks flying in every direction for the time being following the usual method of Boss Battles he targeted the property's weakness that was being attacked the boss hell ferociously preparing to Counterattack Lu Fang shouted directing the formation Fire magic users all of you get ready the entire group responded in unison understood they raised their Shields to block the devastating power of the boss's brutal punch he did not forget to monitor the healing situation keep an eye on my health don't stop yes everyone echoed back Lu Fang continued to command un leash frenzy Fireballs go for it with me here we have no fear then amidst the brutal Battlefield countless fiery red orbs lit up and shot toward the boss everyone was United in their declaration yes resounding in the air in front of such a grand scene Ruan tyen tyan had to concede this smooth coordination doesn't seem like a newly formed team at all it seems that Lu Fang's arrogance isn't just talk he really has the skills choosing to go all out from one attack to the next the boss gradually lost Health Ru and tyan tyan called out where are you great God if you don't come out this Shadow drad could be defeated by L Fang and the others taking advantage of the momentum the team's Spirit seemed to ignite like a flame more invigorated than ever interesting at this rate we might really be able to defeat this Shadow dryad be more Fearless it's not like Lu Fang swung his axe with great mind confidently declaring aside from our numerical Advantage with my leadership a level 10 boss is nothing but unexpectedly the surface of the boss began to turn into a tough layer of stone startling everyone what the hell it's turning to Stone and immune to all damage Lu Fang anxiously shouted to his team the situation is unstable everyone pay attention the boss has entered Phase 2 as the shadow drad devolved to level two it became towering and terrifying to an even greater extent when it stopped cracks of eerie green appeared on the ground they spread towards everyone causing sheer Terror what is happening what is going on don't ask me I don't know anything they shouted loudly as no one had ever experienced the second phase of the Shadow dryad how should we attack next at this moment the roots scattered across the ground suddenly began to move causing some people to fall flat on their faces While others managed to stay upright but the common factor was that everyone was in a panic why is this tree moving the shadow dad's eyes widened and a formidable Legion of little dads was summoned surrounding them from all sides everyone was stunned OMG could it be that the shadow drad is splitting its power to activate these little dads then our numerical Advantage these little dads are at least level seven run away but only Lu Fang was courageous continuing to charge forward toward the little drad his right hand gripping a weapon his left hand holding a shield always ready for battle he did not forget to reassure his teammates what are you running for damn it keep the formation for me provoke it and lure it over to me don't panic however not everyone was fortunate enough to possess a spirit as steel-like as his everyone else was frightened dashing away in a frenzy screaming wildly ah this is too much Lu Fang couldn't help but curse his cowardly comrades you guys on the other side Ru and tyan tyan was being squeezed by a little dryad hanging upside down in the air put me down this freak it's not that I can't get my hands free similar to understanding that she is a beauty the little drad shrieked with incredibly frantic cries R rul and Tian tyan cried out for help great God save me the only response was the excited voice of the little drad re the wind swept through hitting one foot and kicking straight into the belly of the little drad causing it to unexpectedly fall to the ground moaning in pain re e falling freely in such dizzying motion Ruan tyen tyan screamed ah in a truly slay position y Waugh Ruan tyen tan and praised her your mission is accomplished well done just remember to run far away next time you watch a play carrying her like a princess with one hand resting on his shoulder her she unexpectedly exclaimed great God knows I am useful she burst into happiness really did I really help the great God y Wu affirmed confidently of course leaning in her arms wrapped around him Ruan Tha and Tan's eyes wed up looking pitiful that's great even though I was really scared but in the end I was able to contribute seeing that the situation wasn't too serious Yi Wu maintained the somewhat reluctant expression but still comforted her it's okay now I'm very sorry for treating you as bait don't worry once the job is done I will compensate you while they were in the midst of affection Lu Fang's sharp voice cut in Dam it this is not the time for feelings as expected you're a useless piece of trash trying to play tricks y Wu intends to lure us to the boss's Lair and then take advantage of us you guys are truly despicable ye W deny the accusation desp pickable take advantage no I'm just watching the show dealing with the boss like this doesn't actually require your help but your performance has truly surprised me your commanding ability and mature demeanor are quite astonishing Lu Fang gritted his teeth and shouted I don't have time to listen to your flattery if you know my capabilities then let's team up even if you two are just useless you can still serve as Canon fodder quickly lure the Beast over here for me with both hands shoved confidently into his Pockets yiu retorted after a few compliments don't get too complacent luu Fang one of Lu Fang's men yelled loudly at Yu get out of my way you useless piece of trash don't block my path or I'll kill you but very quickly Jan Yi Was Defeated ah yigu said arrogantly team up do you think I need that at the same time he received 8,500 points from Jong y Lu Fang clenched his fist his face and neck etched with green veins his expression Fierce and Incredibly angry as he accused Yu damn it you y wo are dangerous how can you kill your own sigh like this yiu disagreed smirking boldly your own side no no to me you are just points easily obtainable by hiding everywhere Lu Fang was infuriated charging with his weapon ready to give him a beating you dare to act tough in front of me damn it I'll kill you yiu crossed his arms over his chest exuding confidence sarcastically stating oh can't hold back already with just a light flick of my hand I could easily diffuse your imposing momentum remember being spirited imp passionate is good but without strength you'll be the one who dies the fastest on the battlefield collapsing to the ground Lu Fang cursed bastard do I need you to teach me stop acting smart ye woo no matter how good you are at PVP you can't take down a boss alone even if you steal all our points it won't matter if you die at the hands of the boss you won't get any points at all still maintaining a confident demeanor he replied oh really then I'll keep your life for you so that you can die last like this you will be able to witness it with your own eyes he raised one hand to the sky speaking in a hoty tone I've taken all the points how can I withdraw completely Lu Fang was confused you what do you want to do the fireball hovering in the sky shot out sharp Sparks indiscriminately piercing through every living being present on the battlefield a piece of space became chaotic why why are we all so caught in this you are a bastard one of his companions hurriedly fell to the ground clutching Lu Fang's leg brother Fang save me yet Lu Fang callously refuse let go let go of me get off me seeing the situation become unstable the shadow dryad let out a long scream and retracted its power everyone silently speculated the shadow dryad is retracting all its strength fragmenting it ruined tan Tian screened the Petrified body is cracking this meant a large explosion was about to occur countless fragments flew everywhere from within the smoke an evil creature gradually emerged that is the shadow drot in a state of obsession with a recovery amount of 40% belonging to the dark attribute people are discussing this anomaly this new form is much smaller than before isn't it could this be the final form of the Shadow drad tyan was frightened quickly reminding this is indeed the final state of the Shadow dryad what although it has become smaller it seems to be stronger than before great God be careful suddenly the monster disappeared and then reappeared behind Yu it swung its arm to stab at him he was astonished think so fast has its speed increased so much but he quickly reacted and used his sword to block the attack from the shadow dyad while blocking he thought to himself this is not the speed of a level 10 boss moreover the body has shrunk the speed increased but the strength hasn't decreased at all if a normal player doesn't have a special way to deal with monsters it would be truly difficult to take it down perhaps due to miscalculation he was knocked Away by the strength of The Shadow dryad behind the monster countless branches with blue light appeared reaching out to stab at Yu Lu Fang seeing him in a passive position laughed triumphantly ha this is the end does Yu want to fight the boss alone this boss intends to lure you into jumping and then continuously unleashing skills to defeat you by the time you fall the ground you'll be a pile of mush haha at this moment Yu seem to be thrown far away starting to power up a move to defeat the shadow dry it he slashed a few times and immediately the branches were engulfed in flames yiu raised one hand while holding his sword behind him hovering in midair and said the judgment is not wrong so what no matter how Lush the branches and leaves are it's just a level 10 boss The Kills don't need to be that complicated just aim for the weak points and add a little fire and it's done the monster that you woo had set a blaze had now become Furious it roared and howled just as it was about to charge at him Yi Wu had appeared behind it without a sound suddenly a cry rang out while the monster was still bewildered and unaware of what had just happened the slashes appeared Flames erupted enveloping its entire body burning it to ashes it screamed in pain the notification appeared Health reduced to zero congratulations to the player team ywo for defeating the boss the dungeon of nightmares Shadow drat has awarded 10,000 points bonus points awarded 10,000 points congratulations to player y Wu for achieving the achievement of gathering firewood you have cleared the dungeon the Shadow Forest the number of survivors is three the exit has opened please hurry up and leave the dungeon L Fang was in pain as he knelt down he couldn't believe his eyes you you can actually be a support how is that possible are you really y woo seeing Lu Fang in shock y wo calmly replied as long as you were strong enough Anything is Possible the show is over now it's your turn Lu Fang suddenly cried hurriedly hugging y W's leg pleading brother ye I'm sorry the great Lord doesn't hold grudges against lowly persons please spare me I won't disrespect you anymore I'll be your Junior just like before is that all right Yu crossed his arms over his chest showing a disdainful expression you still have the face to say such things now you want to be my junor it's a pity you no longer have the qualifications for that seeing that flattery was ineffective Lu Fang instantly turned hostile stood up and angrily cursed danam it don't get demanding Ru and TNN standing beside them couldn't stand Lu Fang's shamelessness any longer said at this point you still want a sneak attack L Fang such despicable methods won't work against the great God hearing her words Lu Fang grinned sinisterly and responded oh really as soon as he finished peing there was a sudden boom and LU Fang vanished leaving Ruan TN tan utterly surprised is this a puppet card at this moment Lu Fang was standing at the teleportation door he smugly turned back and taunted bye-bye yo no matter how strong you are your combat experience is still too lacking Ruan tan tan quickly shouted he wants to run over here Lu Fang was still boastful speaking loudly you'll never get my points hahahaha but just as he had stepped halfway into the door yiu quickly charged over and delivered a powerful slash after the strike y Wu coldly said in the face of absolute strength experience doesn't matter Lu Fang who was full of Pride suddenly caught off guard by the attack couldn't react in time he was instantly cut in half just able to scream ha ah yigu killed him and the system immediately announced Yi Wu has defeated Lu Fang and acquired all of the team's points Lu Fang's items dropped among which was an item called puppet card after activation the user would split into a puppet that could be freely used while the original body could remain hidden for 30 seconds with two uses remaining the number of survivors in the dungeon was now only two ywu with 62,000 points and Ruan tyan 10 with 21,000 points reading the system notification Ruan tyan tan was extremely delighted raising her hands high and jumping up and down cheering yeah in this dungeon I accumulated 21,000 points according to the exchange rate of 1 to 10 I can have 210,000 I'm hitting the jackpot in contrast to Ruan tnan Yu coldly said I have said it before once we exit the dungeon we will disperse therefore the 500,000 reward from this dungeon is mine you don't have any objections right she hurriedly replied why would I have any objections then she huged Yu's arm mischievously sticking out her tongue and said I'm already very satisfied to get these thank you great God for helping me win Yu smiled with satisfaction at her words thinking to himself this girl knows how to be content even though she's a newcomer her intentions seemed clear enough at that moment the system played a notification defeated the boss the shadow dryad gained 50,000 experience points 20,000 in rewards and items including 20 branches of Shadow dryad 10 bark of Shadow dryad and two magic crystals level 10 especially the natural heart gem enhances the effectiveness of healing weapons by 30% and has a chance to summ a sapling for healing y w held the green gem in his hand pondering a gem that increases healing effectiveness huh equivalent to a rare item but it would do me no good to hold on to it reading the description and seeing its quality it seems to be worth quite a bit but having too many items will raise suspicion making it difficult for me to act in the future thinking for a moment y wo immediately threw the stone towards tantan and said here this is for you tan was puzzled and quickly reached out to catch it wait what what is this you're giving me such an expensive prop I can't do anything with it giving such a valuable stone to me she held the stone in her hands her face flushing continuously as she secretly thought could it be that this great God has feelings for me seeing that she seemed to be misunderstanding Yi Wu hurriedly explained stop please stop those unrealistic wild thoughts of yours this is just a reward for being bait earlier I agreed with you already all right I want to disband the team hearing these words tyen tan felt a bit disappointed pointed and quickly replied yes yes suddenly deafening rumbling sounds erupted and the ground began to crack the system quickly announced warning warning there is an anomaly in the dungeon space the 10 people in the dungeon must Evacuate the portal will close in 2019 time 10 covered her ears with her hands screaming in panic ah ah what's happening at this moment Yi Wu was also confused saying the dungeon has an anomaly in this situation it can only mean that something serious has happened outside both of them quickly ran towards the teleportation door while running ye wuo urged tyen Tien hurry up get into the teleportation door and get out of the dungeon if we get trapped in this space we'll never get out Ruan T and tyan complied responding quickly yes yes the timer was still counting down 16 while running Ruan Tian tan suddenly tripped over something and fell to the ground she screamed in pain ah Yu who was running ahead heard her scream and turned back to ask what's wrong Ty Tien tears welling up from the pain replied it hurts my foot seems to be twisted Yu said urgently not now during such a crucial moment the system continued counting down 13 she burst into tears sobbing I'm sorry I tripped again who as expected a clumsy person like me shouldn't enter such a difficult dungeon you should go great God just leave me behind I can't drag you down anymore suddenly ye wo hugged her waist lifted her up and said you're not wrong in this era doing something beyond your ability is just asking for death although you were quite a handful the system kept counting down 12 feeling suddenly carried like a princess by the great God and hearing such words tyan tan felt a bit embarrassed and softly said great God you y Wu continued to say but anyway You Are My Chosen teammate I cannot abandon a teammate and run away alone at this moment the system was counting down from 10 yiu decisively said so go nine after saying that he turned around and forcefully threw her into the teleportation door tantan was taken by surprise horrified and shouted great God what are you doing tyan reached out towards him wanting to come back she's strained to reach out while crying regarding this the city Town scroll can be used to teleport back from the dungeon to a predetermined location outside if the reality is locked or in a state of combat its use is prohibited the notification sound continues to ring initialization complete starting teleportation in an instant yiu was teleport to the student lounge in the academy the message appeared teleported to The Chosen location upon arriving at the teleportation location seeing the dilapidated entrance to the dungeon left him bewildered he was stunned what's going on why has the exit to the dungeon been destroyed like this where are the teachers and the students could it be an earthquake no the teleportation gate wouldn't be so fragile there must be another reason suddenly a familiar voice reached him who Yu why are you being so foolish it turned out to be Ruan tantion seeing her still crying made Yu speechless hey hey who's being more foolish now is this really the time to think about such things seeing y Wu suddenly appear surprised tyan tition causing her to shout Li woo then she burst into tears who thank goodness you're still alive the teleportation gate is closed I thought you were trapped in the dungeon who you woo feeling helpless quickly patted her head to console her don't cry anymore I'm fine now the teleportation portal is Clos but I still have a city Town scroll she lunged forward hubbed him tightly and sobbed next time don't deceive people promise me Yu was taken aback by her helplessly thinking hey hey what are you thinking in your head all day using a city Town scroll isn't common knowledge after calming down she turned her face away in embarrassment stammering s sorry I was rude yugu was also a bit surprised thinking to himself what's going on Ru and Ty and tan is free in the dungeon but shy outside suddenly a group of people wielding swords appeared out of nowhere seeing that Tien Tian and Y wo were still not captured they cursed in astonishment oh damn it why are there still two students what kind of work is this wasn't it said that all students were locked in the gym quickly capture them if the boss finds out we're dead over here ywo was equally bewildered the markings on their bodies could they be from the black tiger mercenary group The Very group that killed at the safe zone 5 years ago and was expelled y wo felt that something was off thinking to himself no way this mercenary group that puts interests first is sneaking into a safe Zone and even running to a school what's their purpose a school offers no benefits at all suddenly he remembered a person moai one of the three mercenaries lifted his hand to his mouth licked his tongue and Lely said damn it a high school student has such a pretty girlfriend Heaven is too hard to tolerate hearing what he said made ruin tan tan Panic quickly hiding behind Yu seeing her frightened like that he hurriedly reassured her don't worry I'm here it's going to be fine the three of them looked down on him they swam their swords toward him saying damn it a trashy Junior High student dares to act tough break this kiddo's legs I want him to see us play with his girlfriend I haven't played with a school girl before the one next to him added I want to break all three of his legs seeing the situation ye Wu remained unfazed he calmly said all right come on as soon as he finished speaking he dashed forward at lightning speed using his sword to slice through two of the three both of whom were level 15 notifications system the defeat reward is 20,000 experience points the other man was utterly astonished he could not believe what had just happened no it can't be you clearly only have level three how could you kill someone at level 15 like us hearing this yiu casually replied I've heard these words so many times already if I remember correctly those who are expelled like you who invade the safe area whether alive or dead will have a bounty on them you came here sure not just a hand over the bounty to me right the other man had only 6% help left hearing ye we say that he hurriedly fell to his knees and begged please don't kill me I can give you anything money Intel spare my life as he spoke he took out all his possessions wanting to offer them to yiu but Yu didn't care he stabbed into the man's shoulder and activated the skill the Chan Emperor triggering the passive skill that dealt damage every second up to 1% Max maximum in pain the man voluntarily confessed m n we came to kill m n y Wu showed no interest and said such an obvious answer holds no value at all the man trembled in fear and continued it's the Huang Jen group it's the Huang Jen group they hired us to kill mokai not only did they let us into the safe Zone but they also let the teen leader rare props to control her two close bodyguards yuu paused reached up to Str broke his chin and pondered I had heard that the Hang Jen group and the Hano group have been fighting to the death over ownership of the dungeon hunting ground but this time they dare to Target Moki which shows there are problems within the Huang genen group thinking of this he stopped turned and said to the mercenary this intelligence has some value upon hearing this the mercenary quickly bowed his head greatfully thank you for sparing my life after saying that he hurriedly took out a healing potion from his bag and drank it frantically as he drank he thought hurry up I need to heal meanwhile Yu was looking towards the barrier to analyze the situation the whole venue is sealed off by the barrier it seems there's no chance to get out to report to the handm group and exchange for some reward the mercenary who was madly healing also realized something was wrong huh why am I still losing blood what is this before he could finish suddenly the mercenary burst into Flames he screamed ah you lied to me y wo didn't pay any attention to what he said not bothering to turn around with his hands in his pockets he replied leisurely deceive from the beginning to the end I never said I would spare you where does Deception come from Upon finishing the system displayed a notification reward 10,000 experience points received 500 gold one level 11 magic Crystal one low-level gem one adult magazine Yu was left speechless what's with all these weird items dropping he turned to remind Ruan and tant the school is sealed off by a barrier we can't get out you need to find a safe place to hide be careful not to get spotted she was a bit worried about him yes yes but what are you planning to do this time if we go out we'll run into the mercenary Groot from the black market Yu's expression turned serious as he said right now I'm the only one with a chance to save everyone even if it's dangerous I have to go I'll emphasize again you must find a place to hide don't make any mistakes again making a mistake in reality can cost you your life time Tian replied yes I understand I will definitely find a place to hide ruy tyen tyen felt very happy secretly thinking dry Woo is he caring about me this is really great even though I'm very weak he doesn't look down on me at all tyen tyan cheerfully said said vwoo you need to be careful too pay attention to safety the maale lead confidently replied don't worry I have thought of a way then he thought to himself the most important goal is to protect M's life my Golden Master lady cannot die here otherwise whom will I ask for the reward at the same time there was another group of people probably the same Bunch as the previous ones they were complaining as they walked damn it haven't we captured all the students yet yet why don't we still have to expend effort patrolling another person saw it and replied isn't the teen leader afraid there are still students left in the dungeon who said our squat was ordered by the team leader to guard the dungeon door the last person shouted what are you afraid of we have already broken the dungeon door even if there are still students inside they must have died in the dungeon there can't be any left what good does it do you tell me ship change time is up let's go back to the team they were engrossed in conversation completely unaware that you w had sneaked in unnoticed the male lead pondered the patroling fodder are all level 15 coupled with their numerical Advantage ordinary teachers are only level 10 to 20 they really can't fight back he looked at the status board feeling a bit anxious the recovery time of true I had 20 minutes left Miss Mo you must hold on he silently thought before I have a clear understanding of the Manpower distribution of the entire school I'll just follow these two people the teen leader they mentioned might be able to provide even more information at this moment in another room there was a teacher and many other students who had been captured a junior said boss the students caued from the dungeon entrance are all here the boss replied very good one Junior among them shouted don't move if you want to live behave yourselves while the students were in panic the teacher spoke up what do you want let let me and my students go the boss stepped closer eyeing her with a greedy look damn it who tied her up like this she's quite a talent he was the little team leader of the mercenary Squad she remained unfazed and continued you dare to cause trouble in the academy within the safe Zone before she could finish speaking he grabbed her chin and leaned in close saying this is not something you need to think about you should think about how to serve me in a way that pleases me in exchange for the right to live she was tearing up but still resolutely turned her face away Letting Go however she did not know that doing so only made him more fascinated oh so you're tough look at this girl in the safe Zone she's really different day after day eating well and sleeping soundly apart from her temper even puberty treats her well like this haha I like it the underling saw this and stepped forward to flatter her haha this girl is my binding the team leader is satisfied that's all that matters but after you finish eating don't forget to leave some rice and soup for your brothers the team leader chuckled with delight haha this Kido is interesting next up will be your turn the underling respectfully replied thank you team leader haha on the student side L Fang who was captured was still fuming thinking a bunch of cowards if we dared to fight back against these guys at least we could let the teachers run out and signal for help suddenly the teen leader grabbed the outer garment of the female teacher and yanked the book Away exposing the inner part of her clothing he shamelessly said we can't delay any longer let's deal with this right now she was scared her whole body trembling at that moment L Fang couldn't hold back any longer he charged at that scum and knocked him away lever go you scum after that looking at her he thought she is my goddess how can I just stand by and watch her being spoken to interestingly by that teen leer then he quickly turned back and punched Lu Fang in the stomach catching him off guard L Fang looked at the teen leader and smiled with Amusement a fifth grade kid daring to act like a hero to save the beauty I see you seem to have intentions towards this girl right but it's not surprising who wouldn't have intentions for a good catch a leer like you someone who doesn't even value his life I actually quite like the punch was so strong that it made L Fang SP out blood the teen leader threw a knife in front of Lu Fang and said you have the potential to be a bad guy pick up the knife he helped Lu Fang up and pointed at the rub of students the nature of this era is just like that don't let the peace in the safe Zone blind you these useless kids don't deserve to survive kill them and you can continue to Live While also being able to join our black tiger mercenary corpse his words caused the group of students below to panic and they scrambled what no brother Fang don't kill us after being untied he had darkened expression L Fang I am truly a bad guy as he spoke he picked up the knife and approached the group of students what no brother Fang don't kill us he continued not only am I a senior in school but I also enjoy the thrilling pleasure of Killing In The Dungeons battles Li also looked worriedly at him L Fang he replied but I can distinguish between reality and the dungeon he smiled swung his knife at the team leader and yelled what kind of mercenary Brigade is this I don't want any of it go die scum however his attack was easily dodged the team leader grabbed Lu Fang's hand controlling him I thought you had some brains but I guess you still disappoint me want to be a hero saving the beautiful dancel huh this is the outcome saying that he raised his sword and struck a blow towards Lu Fang damn it I've finally managed to do something good in this life and yet this is the outcome what a world Lu Fang kept cursing but he had to close his eyes and brace for the blow at that moment a familiar voice rang out looks like you're not as scum as I thought L Fang the team leader cried out in pain the underling worriedly asked team leader what's wrong with you Lu Fang was astonished this voice is before he could finish his sentence the teen leader collap collaps to the ground leaving L Fang confused what happened to this guy all of a sudden the deadly fangs of the Red Widow deal significant damage to the user in addition to inflicting poison bleeding and weakening States the remaining uses are two yeu suddenly appeared saying although I usually do a lot of evil Deeds when faced with danger I can still act like a man the stealth skill after use grants the ability to become invisible lasting for 30 seconds with a 1hour cool down but can be sensed by highle creatures Yu lightly brushed off his shoulder saying it seems that keeping an eye on the two mercenaries was the right choice is everyone all right in his mind he calculated thanks to the assistance of the chaien emperor both stealth and attack items can exhibit extraordinary effects so what's the limit I have to find an opportunity to test it out behind y woo a group of people quickly rushed forward whispering in Surprise why did this kiddo suddenly appear and then Ambush the teen leader the teen leader is at level 25 he must have used some despicable item let's kill him Yu didn't bother to turn around but calmly crossed his arms saying if you want to live quickly bow down Lu Fang the blonde man was startled and stammered ouch suddenly a beam of light flew past him making him hurriedly bend down but he was still struck by the beam of light causing several strands of hair to fall luu Fang exclaimed in shock finishing his last word down the group of mercenaries was annihilated by Yu's single strike cutting through and eliminating the entire group of Men In Black the system announced congratulations player has earned a reward of 5,000 experience points the little leader of the mercenary group fell witnessing his teammate's head chopped off before him his eyes widened in Anger as he struggled to speak you in the room everyone still tied up saw the and exclaimed in panic Li Woo You You Killed Someone Lu Fang was sitting as if kneeling shouting at them shut up why didn't anyone stand up earlier now you're bold enough to speak y woo with his hand stuffed in his pockets stood without even glancing at them the students were still trying to cling to him flattering him if it weren't for you woo we'd all be dead here these scum aren't worth mourning brother Fang is absolutely right ye woo a amazing thank you Yu didn't look at them but simply asked when faced with real life and death your performance has changed my perspective you deserve to be my junior do you still want to join me Lu Fang heard this and was overjoyed quickly raising his hand and saying please let me join brother Yu he bowed his head and slammed it hard against the ground saying I don't want to be a small fish swallowed by a big fish anymore I want to become stronger for this goal I will do whatever you you ask of me Yu kicked up the small knife lying in his feet and caught it with his hand a commendable ambition only those who have truly faced life and death can understand the essence of this era he handed the knife to Lu Fang and said take this consider it a gift of experience from them you know what to do right Lu Fang nodded rapidly yes the little leader of the mercenary team bound and lying on the ground looked up with tears in his eyes and cursed damn it you rotten students you dare to touch the black tiger Brigade he threatened Lu Fang with all his might I advise you to behave and release me quickly if not not only will you face consequences but your whole family will also perish Lu Fang brandished the knife his face full of murderous intent and said to him I of course know the things your Brigade has done therefore I won't hesitate the little leader team shouted in panic hey wait stop at this moment the system announced little leader teen level 25 mercenaries poisoned bleeding weakened Lu Fang spoke up I never thought I would have a day to take matters into my own hands he quickly brought the knife down the little leader team mercenaries saw this and could only say ah before they could finish their sentence they were eliminated Lu Fang was so astonished that he stammered this this is he gawked at his scoreboard Lu Fang level 10 P everyone was now untied nearly in a row looking at Lu Fang in astonishment what leveling up five levels in a row soap surprising luu Fang knelt down once more bowing his head in gratitude to yiu thank you thank you brother Yi for your help Lu Fang's light from now on is yours Yi Wu extended his hand towards him hurriedly saying all right no need to go overboard like that at this moment everyone turned towards Yi wo crying and pleading with him brother y please please let me join you I will definitely work hard only he heard everyone earnestly clasping their hands and saying yes yes please take me with you brother ye y Wu glanced at them thinking are you guys worth it Anne Fang was releasing the teacher from her binds while turning to scold them boss is right you cowards you don't even deserve to carry shoes being able to save is already good enough enough shut up all of you the group trembled and lowered their heads replying quietly yes the teacher shyly looked at Lu Fang and said thank you Lu Fang in my eyes you have always been a troublemaker but I didn't expect that at a critical moment you would rush forward for me thank you when Lu Fang heard her say that he blushed and awkwardly responded no no need to thank me the benefit of being a troublemaker is that there's no need to hold back back who would have the guts to watch you being bullied by bad people I couldn't stand it ye Wu watched them as if they wanted to confess feelings to each other and started to sweat quickly saying all right hurry up and help me unte the others we can't stay here for long luu Fang quickly replied yes yes the teacher also helped them she turned to Yu and worriedly asked vwoo what should we do next there are still many students locked up and the school is off there's no way to escape and call for help Yu did not look at her but replied no need to worry I will think of a way at that moment the system announced the true eye skill has finished its cooldown it can be used at any time you who looked at the system panel excitedly said it's right on time the system used true eye on the school a large eye appeared in the sky radiating Flames that illuminated the entire School the system announced system has used true ey on the school true ey has been activated School simulation is complete and life forms are distributed please check the map Yu stared intently at the map on the system thinking from this map most of the teachers in the school are trapped in the gym although the levels of the guards are not high their numbers are substantial there are no guards in the storage room possibly allowing the teacher and students to there he thought for a moment but he stared intently at the bright red marker points on the map these black tiger Legions are not just a facade there are two experts above level 40 the level 45 is definitely the team leader in the rest area so the level 20 must be Moi her bodyguard why is there no other level 40 displaying on the map at the school gate it must be similar to the deputy Commander after y Wu examined the map he approached Lu Fang and the others and instructed on my way here I saw that the school storage was unguarded L Fang you take Miss Li and everyone else there to hide Lu Fang quickly said but I want to follow the boss and help you eliminate those soldiers Yu tossed a weapon that resembled a multi-tool knife in a bright red color to L Fang right now you're just a burden to me besides you have a more important task which is to protect Miss lie and everyone this is for you Lu Fang held the small weapon in his hand amazed and said this this is the combat item that the boss used earlier to kill Lo level 25 mercenaries how could I take something of such high level it would be a waste Yu stood before the door glancing at him before saying take this with your current strength if you encounter someone from the Brigade you're as good as dead remember you must avoid fighting at all costs if you can't evade it then subdue the enemy first and take advantage of the backstab to maximize its effect it can still be used twice so make sure to calculate the timing carefully Lu Fang tightened his grip on the knife in his hand responding confidently don't worry boss backstabbing is my specialty the people standing behind him listened as he boasted about his strength all breaking into a sweat and left speechless Yi Wu walked away leaving behind the words well then don't disappoint me Yi Wu found a hidden Corner open the system panel to recalculate although the primary goal is to rescue Miss Mo that regimental leader is level 45 the gap between our levels is far too deep even with the Chen Emperor's support facing a gap of 33 levels I'm not confident I can win the biggest problem now is that I cannot engage in fights Beyond My Level Yu gazed at the group of mercenaries standing next to the tank at the school gate and thought with my level 12 link capacity I can handle enemies below level 25 but what about that gatekeeper at level 40 facing a gap of 28 levels is not simple to be safe I should quickly level up my link capacity y Wu opened the system and entered the system space the system announced the player has accumulated 50,000 experience points you can choose to level up the link account or unlock a special skill Yi Wu raised his hands standing opposite the person in red armor and said level up the link the system announced link level increased by nine levels current level 21 yiu clenched his fists feeling the power surging through throughout his body he turned around and looked at his information panel vwoo level four he was astonished finally my own level has increased by one this means the ratio between the link level and my own level is 10 to1 and once the system supports the system continued to announce the linked account has reached level 20 successfully activated the talent of the chaien emperor there is one Talent Point remaining please choose the direction of the talent Yu looked at the map displayed on the system and said Talent he examined the displayed options and realized there were two choices DPS or t rubbing his chin he thought although the link level has increased there is still a gap of about 20 levels choosing defensive Talent might be the most reasonable option after all survival is the most important thinking that he clicked on the selection panel the system announced defensive Talent selected specialized defense has achieved one star level Yu was thinking later let's see what a one-star defense can really do at that moment the system continued to broadcast the active skill accompanying the defensive Talent has been unlocked on the system panel information about the new skill appeared eruption an active Malle skill of the defensive Talent uses fire to burn the target reducing the opponent's defensive capabilities this skill lasts for 1 minute and takes 1 hour to recharge yiu was surprised to see the this information he smirked a bold idea flashing in his mind looks like this is quite an interesting skill suddenly I have a daring way outside the group of mercenaries was on guard chatting among themselves one soldier said it's really good in this safe Zone always peaceful and calm so different from the scene outside the teammate next to him nodded of course even as strong as our black tiger Legion is we wouldn't dare to venture far away from the safe Zone to explore the unknown areas of land they shared stories about a dark and dangerous place I heard that land is an ancient ruin of Earth before the O era it is filled with powerful beasts and wild dungeons and to this day no one has dared to explore it even the teams from major corporations must be extremely cautious when exploring outside fiercely competing for the newly discovered dungeons the soldier standing opposite wondered hey I heard that both Wang Jen group and hanm have dis Ed ownership of a dungeon so this Mission hearing that the other guy feared and quickly interrupted don't say anymore the head doesn't allow us to talk nonsense the two were still chatting Carefree when suddenly a beam of light appeared around them they opened their mouths in Surprise and before they could understand what was happening a large fire engulfed them burning fiercely the sound of painful screams echoed a the system announced players earn a reward of 200 experience points y Wu dashed in quickly running while calculating this area has six level 15 people three level 21 people and one level 40 he thought to himself quickly kill the lower level people first leave the level 40 for last The Mercenaries noticed an intruder rushing in and immediately shouted not good there's an enemy one angrily cursed damn it who wasn't keeping a close watch on these students to let this kid run out here another quickly urged stopped talking nonsense and killed him they all aimed their guns at y wo and opened fire y woo wielding a weapon charged Straight Ahead using his sword to deflect the gunfire from The Mercenaries he focused on observing his surroundings and noticed several armored tanks that had been modified he thought to himself if I'm not mistaken this brigade has no fixed base their valuable assets must be carried with them perhaps they are store in those tanks suddenly a rain of bullets the size of grenades descended upon yiu as soon as the bullets hit the ground they exploded causing severe destruction to the entire area around him a tall Burly man with spiky red hair holding a large gun and smoking a cigar laughed loudly haha just an ant no need to panic just blow him up the information display about him appeared big gun level 40 The Mercenaries shouted in unison upon seeing him the deputy Commander big gun another one laughed saying with the deputy Commander's attack that kid is surely blown to bits they watched the large Flames ahead cheerfully saying of course just a kid who dares to come here and cause trouble at that moment a voice emerged from the Flames saying oh really you think this little fire can burn me ye wo appeared swiftly swinging his sword towards the soldiers those standing Too Close were so astonished they couldn't Dodge only able to cry out ah how is this possible the deputy Commander stood at top the tank gritting his teeth as he looked down this kid he was sweating when he saw that yiu was unharmed on the contrary he was overpowering his subordinates his face darkened with anger impossible six detonating shells of mine couldn't kill a mere level four kid YW held a large sword in his hand surrounded by four massive Shields confidently looking up at big guns provokingly saying six shells not even cloes bring out all the Firepower you've got hidden under the treasure in his heart hu was also joyfully thinking no wonder it's the special defensive Talent of the king even though it's only one star it has such high defensive power if it reaches five stars clearing high level dungeons alone wouldn't be a dream big gun aimed the gun's muzzle at ywo his Fierce face glaring down this kid's tone is true truly arrogant no matter who you are daring to confront the black tiger Brigade only leads to death I will let you taste the Firepower of Hell's Roar firing without running out of bullets Yi Wu quickly dodged the bullets sprayed out densely like rain his health status at that moment was only 90% left while dodging yiu Advanced forward laughingly saying still not out of ammo truly a good weapon he looked up at Big Gun speaking Under Pressure this is the real level of level 40 this way My Level Up Challenge becomes even more meaningful y Wu accelerated shooting forward like a rocket when he was close to Big Gun his health had dropped to 85% seeing Yu charging towards him big gun immediately redirected his gun continuing to fire cursing a level up challenge with only level four of yours are you kidding is your brain malfunctioning I admit you're tough to deal with but thinking that means anything is just ridiculous y Wu closed in on big gun quickly swinging his sword to strike big gun used his Cannon to block the sword strike disdainfully saying with attack power as weak as yours you think you can kill me you really underestimate My Level 40 big gun took a hit from The Sword but on the system's health bar his health only decreased to 98% you look at the system panel feeling a sense of dread sure enough the level Gap makes my physical attacks unable to deal significant damage to him big gun taking advantage of Yu's momentary distraction swung his guns Barrel hard sending y Wu flying a distance away he bellowed I don't understand I've been rolling in the safe Zone up to level 40 why am I being looked down upon by a level four kid like you Yu's Health after that blow was reduced to 75% but he quickly recovered flipped over stood up and looked at Big Gun chuckling if you already know that leveling up is not easy the deputy Commander big gun panicked when he realized he had just been tricked by yiu oh no no time to use an item this kid has set me up however he was baffled to find that his body was not affected negatively only a strange debuff appeared but his health remained unchanged realizing he had been fooled big gun shouted in Anger firing continuously at ywu damn it you dared to mess with me holy [ __ ] this is a real battle not a game go die I'm no longer in the mood to play with you yiu immediately raised his shield to block the bullets although big gun's Firepower was stronger than before he still confidently maintained his health for a minute suddenly the system alert triggered detected players Health below 10% activating the ultimate extremity skill of defensive Talent lock blood last 20 seconds ywu is fortunate to have the opportunity to Counterattack his lock blood is precise at this moment in 20 seconds the outcome of the battle will be decided big gun is infuriated by being challenged by a lowly character like yiu damn it a level one kid dares to challenge me he must either be crazy or stupid suddenly the hell Roar weapon of big gun malfunctions the climing sound of metal colliding from his weapon produces an unpleasant noise what's wrong with my hell Roar the armor and weapon of big guns shatter into pieces why is my equipment like this he falls to the ground clutching the pile of scrap weapons with a look of pity meanwhile Yu has secured victory in his hands he stands proudly in front of big gun it seems I was right your equipment's durability is not high if it's not the last moment you definitely wouldn't be willing to invest in buying good gear after finishing the intense battle yiu uses a basic recovery potion restoring 30% of his health he confidently replies I admit I was a bit Reckless but in the end I made the right bet big gun refuses to accept his humiliation and defeat he stands up holding a grenade planning to commit suicide with yiu what bet even if all my equipment is broken losing all its attributes so what don't underestimate the items I have accumulated over the years I could still Crush you y Wu immediately swung the fiery sword close to Big gun's neck he was terrified his face drained to blood and hurriedly said if you could kill me with the tools you have I would have died a long time ago nothing would have changed on the contrary you were even easier to kill now than before big gun was terrified and knelt in fear saying wait a minute I understand now I won't resist anymore please don't kill me I'm just a Hired Hand it's all according to the heads orders youu spared big gun's life and said all the then I'll give you a chance open all the treasures in the car big gun immediately complied without daring to argue yes yes suddenly he stopped opening them and instead told gu Wu the password for the treasure the password for the treasure is hhmb 666 y wo interrupted him immediately did I ask you for the password I said to open the treasure just when he thought he had tricked y Wu he didn't expect that y Wu had cleverly anticipated this move big gun complied bowing his head and thinking I didn't expect I couldn't deceive him this kid is a student how can he be so clever he then raised his hand input the password for the Treacher outwardly pretending to comply but his thoughts were very Sinister trying to delay time for someone to come to rescue him he pretended to yield to BU time thinking the head will definitely send someone over here at that time I will make it wish it were dead after inputting the password word the treasure chest opened it seemed that he had escaped death at the hands of Yu but unexpectedly after opening the treasure chest and turning back to plead with Y wo for Mercy he asked can I be spared like this before he could finish his sentence Yu's fiery sword pierced through his body Yu was Resolute he could do nothing is there really spring you foolish guy the whole body of big gun caught fire he was doomed you you didn't say he could only run and scream help the head save me big gun was completely subdued by the heat of the fire from The Sword Yu struck him down and immediately the server announced you have received a highly deserved reward congratulations player you have earned 30,000 experience points the reward was not over yet you have received 2,000 gold a hell Roar weapon and a special item a level 40 Dungeon key that cannot be used yet this reward was received immediately but it was still not enough to satisfy Yu's greed only 2,000 this Deputy Commander is failing pitifully like this no wonder he has no money to buy gear he thought but there is a special item that he cannot ignore however this dungeon key is a surprising Harvest it seems that this Deputy Commander has hidden some personal items the server then displayed a notification about the item dungeon key level 40 recommended level 40 to 45 location c87 outside the safe Zone appearance unknown description unknown ymu ignored the unusable item and focused on the treasure for now let's put the dungeon key aside the treasure is what matters it was his first time opening a treasure and he felt a bit excited but if this was the Vault of the black tiger Legion wasn't it a bit small the server continued to send congratulations to Y Wu congratulations on achieving the achievement of first treasure the Journey of opening the treasure for the player starts here yiu was quite surprised opening the treasure also grants an achievement I didn't expect opening the treasure could lead to an achievement this is really surprising but never mind let's see what's inside haha the server repeatedly announced the rewards that Yu received from the treasure congratulations player you have obtained loot gold 1.28 million secondary gunpowder 50 high-grade explosives 230 health potions 150 Mana potions 150 ancient magic crystals 10 Enchanted ammunition 500 Medusa's TI one ywu was quite surprised by the loot he obtained I didn't expect to find an epic item but it doesn't State its effect what is this supposed to do and there's also this Yu suddenly received an incredibly valuable item ancient magic Crystal I remember remember this is a rare Magic Crystal that can absorb and convert into experience points while this type of experience points might not mean much for level 40 for me it's a great gift the magic Crystal instantly glowed the server announced successfully converted one ancient magic Crystal player has gained 100,000 experience points Yu couldn't help but feel Overjoyed 100,000 P Joy followed joy as the server informed y wo the player has now accumulated 130,000 experience points it is recommended that the player unlock other accounts to gain greater strength Yu didn't rush to follow the next steps suggested by the server the amount of experience points came at just the right time but he decided not to unlock the other accounts just yet at least for now I need to ensure this chenne account becomes an offensive and defensive account before considering the next steps Yi Wu immediately commanded the server opened the Chen Emperor Talent panel after the Chen Talent table appeared the system immediately notified gu Wu your current Talent is onear defense you can use 100,000 experience points to increase the connection level by 10 obtaining one star Talent points that can be freely distributed yiu was taken back finding it too expensive what it costs 100,000 experience points to gain a one-star Talent Point that's too much the main character then asked the system how many experience points are needed to open another account the system replied the amount of experience points required to open a new account with an initial connection level of 20 is 100,000 Yu pondered for a while it seems that holding on to 100,000 experience points is not feasible overall it would be better to open a new account he still felt a bit uneasy hopefully I can get lucky and choose a stronger account the main character then made a decisive decision system unlock a new king account the system immediately accepted the request Yu extended his hand forward and the system opened the door with the notification unlocking new king account please wait a thick fog enveloped the area and the new king account was successfully unlocked with a mad scientist although the mad scientist Came From Another World with his talent and inventions he ultimately led to the destruction of his own world but in his mind he held all the mysteries of that world ye felt lucky but his face showed a hint of confusion I guess I'm quite lucky but the account I opened is not the king combat system Yu looked at the control screen a mad scientist but in some ways he is also a man at the Pinnacle of the world let's see what skills you have a few titles appeared on the 3D screen such as master of engineering what are these titles the system quickly provided a notification crazy Moss does not have fixed skills and its skills will change according to the titles the currently unlocked title is master of engineering and the subject has an upgrade link of 10 levels to unlock other titles after the system's notification Yi Wu felt a bit delighted and intrigued based on the title it must lean more towards support with a wide coverage and high playability suddenly a current surged into yiwu spreading throughout his body the system switched the account to Crazy Moss the server announced the main account has been switched to Crazy Moss the current account title is master of engineering its ability is before the server could finish its sentence a robot flew in from somewhere let me explain to the master the robot spoke with great joy upon encountering yo after many years without activation I am finally activated again Yu was quite surprised to meet the aat robot Vis who are you immediately the robot greeted and introduced the report of the new master I was created by the original Master you can directly call me I Vis I can help you conquer this world you who heard this and brushed it off uninterested stop with the secondary second world domination nonsense I won't do that the robot I Vis immediately showed a wicked face because he knew the secret of this account Master you are still not stylish enough The Secret of this powerful account is madness whether in action or imagination the more mad you are the stronger you will become y Wu scared I Vis so much that he sweated profusely no no I wouldn't dare after finishing the intimidation y Wu ordered him then get to the point explain the operational mechanism and capabilities of this account clearly to me in 70 words I'm this could only respond obediently yes yes yes the core system of the account is the fusion decomposition to create various objects with the current title of Master engineer technical object objects can be separated and then fused to create new powerful objects after hearing the explanation YW realize something interesting this account is more interesting than I thought no wonder the crazier you are the stronger you become this capability is indeed useless without crazy ideas it really can't be played with suddenly I viz raised some notes that Peak Yu's curiosity the current master has certain limitations regarding the objects the objects can freely decompose merge the robot elaborated further with your current linkage level you cannot decompose objects larger than double your level moreover we need to collect as many technical blueprints as possible to manufacture tools and weapons quickly and accurately after hearing the explanation y Wu understood the issue I see so what is the mechanism for switching between accounts are there any specific limitations the robot I've this hesitated this is something I can only the server system feeling annoyed at I Vis interrupting cut him off immediately have you finished speaking I thought a little robot like you would know everything the accounts in the system can be seamlessly switched whether in a combat state or not however I advise the master to determine the best way to switch accounts to avoid causing irreparable danger after a detailed explanation Yu generally graft his current situation understood therefore I should also set off to attend to important matters I cannot keep the women waiting too long the robot pondered awkwardly as he was lightly teased and quickly asked Master what about me Yu replied just wait black tiger burst into Miss M's room you got quite a nerve without hesitation she criticized him you barged into a secure area without permission and you even dare to kill me do you know who hired you to kill me black tiger replied with a tone as if he was teasing her Miss MO you should know that our black tiger group wouldn't dare to kill you but if someone supports me before black tiger could finish his sentence M naai had already figured it out it could be the Hang Jen group black tiger jumped forward standing in front of M naai it is indeed the Hang Jen group if not they're the ones providing Epic Level props like the eye of Medusa our black tiger group cannot handle the two Elite Fighters under your command Moki made her deductions the W Jen group has resorted to such Desperate Measures trying to take the ownership copy of area c23 from the hanmo group even coming up with this foolish method thinking that killing me will dismantle the handm mo group so mave black tiger unhesitatingly moved closer sitting next to moii and said haha I won't meddle in the Grievances between your groups mercenaries have only one goal and that is money Miss Mo since you are an intelligent person I will clarify things for you he leaned close to M's ear and with a few threatening words he thought he had frightened Miss Mo the Hang Jen group has offered me 50 million to kill you if you can come up with 100 million I can set you free m n smirked with a contemptuous smile so my life is worth 100 million black tiger thought he had hit the jackpot if Miss Mo can offer more then I would certainly be happy to accept upon hearing this M9 leaned in closer to Black tiger lifted his face and laughed dream on for someone as dishonest as you I won't give a single scent black tiger angrily shouted Miss Mo you are a smart person why you continue to say these things to provoke me do you want money or not I will give you another chance to rethink your words think clearly moai lightly replied haha that's unnecessary the handm mo group will never be led by the nose nor will it allow anyone to undermine its Majesty even my life cannot be sacrificed for that being deceived by you today was my mistake but to kill me to destroy the hando group is nothing short of a joke black tiger withdrew his two swords and responded really giving you a chance to keep your life that you don't want then I also don't need to say meaningless things he swung his sword up go die your head is also something worth money the two swords were swung fiercely but met with the energy Shield surrounding Moi produced proding a deafening sound that left black tiger astonished this is an energy Shield why all of a sudden in the tense atmosphere a voice suddenly echoed this energy Shield is my way of thanking you for what happened last time at the black market M9 turned sharply towards the source of the voice your ywo Yu leaned against the door calmly saying but to take a step forward you need to pay extra if I can save your life I won't ask for more than 10 million m n was surprised it's you y wo what are you doing here black tiger swung his sword towards y wo just a level four kid daring to hinder my business go die though he faced that blo head on Yi Wu only lost 20% Health black tiger was taken aback how can his defense be so high I used all my strength to slash and only dealt 20% damage on the contrary Yu thought to himself hey hey the one who should be surprised is me right just a moment ago facing level 40 I managed to hold out for a long time now with just a few hits I could be killed the defense rate is too low if it were someone else who was careless they would have lost their life by now m n saw the situation was not promising and shouted vwoo even if you have a bit of ability you should see the situation clearly this has nothing to do with you you don't need to act like a hero and come to die just get lost before she finished speaking several Ola members began to fire at her she was startled a the energy shield no matter how strong could notand their attack for long Yu replied to her this is not interfering in someone else's business Miss Mo if you die who will I find to collect the points and rewards that I have worked hard to earn so don't worry I won't let you die Kai sighed and thought this person is indeed so greedy for money it makes sense otherwise how could he dare to rush into the black market alone The Shield Under The Continuous attack had also reached a state of depletion but then something surprising happened the energy Shield has restored to 100% how is that possible black tiger said your strength is not right how could you have such a rare artifact like this he expressed doubt it seems like you're not really level four where did you come from and why you hide your strength Yi Wu regarded this comment as nothing while launching his attack back he shouted your rank is high but you're also quite cautious no wonder you can be the head compared to your subordinates you're just bigger in size your mind is indeed a bit better in his heart he thought no wonder he's crazy Moss I used the technical Master skills to combine three energy Shields into one gaing three times the defensive value this effect is truly intimidating black tiger realized something was off could it be that the explosion outside just now was caused by you what did you do as soon as he finished speaking he and his companions saw grenades flying everywhere he was shocked this is a grenade black tiger activated his shield while saying I still underestimated you initially I was a bit worried that you might create some unexpected trouble for me but now it seems that if you are relying on these grenades you might as well just lie down on the ground and wait to die the grenade exploded shooting out a multitude of spider threads that ens snared black tiger and his companions he suddenly shouted spider web curses echoed everywhere damn it this spider web is swallowing my recovery I can't escape until now I've never heard of any item like this what on Earth is it the head save me youu saw them stuck like this and said this is not an ordinary grenade this is a binding grenade that I just created how is it sticky enough tight enough utilizing the spider web ghost dies along with the grenade form a binding weave it can control the target's movements for 10 minutes dealing continuous damage black tiger forcibly Broke Free of the spiderweb angrily saying still the same old story don't think you can defeat me with these toys real battles are not for children leave the child's play to experienced adults who know what true fighting is as he spoke he gathered lightning into his own blade and aimed it at ywu yiu observed and thought If an item made of low-level materials cannot deal with highlevel martial artists then I can only immediately black tiger added a dagger to ywu Shield die his health bar immediately dropped to 50% after taking the hit he thought to himself his speed and strength have drastically improved if this continues my shield will be broken if he lands two more hits I will die I don't even have a chance to drink a potion in this perilous situation y Wu tried to stay calm and not panic he had to follow the plan to defeat him Yu Unleashed his skills but black tiger dodged he said too slow I've activated sword mode and you want to use sword skills bring out something more feasible otherwise in front of my thunderstorm electric attack you will definitely be killed black tiger swept his sword striking directly at Yu causing his health to drop to 10% the system's voice rang out subjects Health below 10% defense defensive Talent limit reached Health block activated hearing the system announcement y Wu thought the health block is activated this is the decisive moment of Victory or defeat black tiger unexpectedly shouted magic however in an instant he slashed through the incoming magic saying not happening if a low-level magic attack from you hits me it wouldn't even be an issue for a level 45 like me moii having observed for a while spoke up to enough ye woo run away quickly if you continue to drag this out you will really die however as he thrust his sword into the ground creating fiery whirlwinds around him he replied run we fought to this extent there's no way to escape besides I haven't lost yet the real fight is just beginning black tiger surrounded by the whirlwinds of fire said is this what you call enthusiasm is this your skill just this little pain are you here to be a joke his health bar had only dropped by a meager 10% black tiger sprang forward piercing through the rings of fire and said the time for comedy is over I don't have the patience to waste on you one final strike to send you to your end facing such a critical situation Yi Wu remained calm and said oh really the like emitted from the machine gun caught black tiger off guard is this the hell Roar ban no this is clearly modified did you really kill my bigon impossible as he spoke he had to create a shield to block the Relentless gunfire aimed at him bang bang bang Yu calmly watched black tiger struggle no need to be astonished by such obvious things but right now it's not called hell Roar anymore it's called The Gallows howl the beginning of the Arena howls at level 40 can utilize the technique of Firepower reinforcement A specialized automatic weapon that tracks unlimited ammunition lasting for 1 minute with a cool down time of 3 hours he sneered aren't you worried about my low damage attacks I use guns epic weapons that regenerate shouldn't that surprise you a bit more black Tiger's Shield had been shattered he thought the energy Shield should have held up longer but in a direct confrontation like this the Hellfire bins Roar can already suppress me rapid fire speed great power the key is the special effect of the infinite ammo moreover after he doesn't know how it regenerates it even has the ability to Auto fire he no longer dodged deciding to charge towards Yi Wu with 55% Health thinking to himself how can I avoid it I'll just endure it with more than half of my health expended I must deal with this nuisance and afterward with just one sword I'll finish it off he rushed toward the howling Arena swinging his sword and saying this skill of yours truly surprises me but aside from the agility of the guns turning it into a stationary Target is really a damn foolish move you wasted a perfectly good epic weapon he swung his sword straight no longer caring if you die it will finally belong to me go die obediently Yu replied to those words using this gun is to lure you into being sliced because the real drama lies here yiu quickly positioned himself behind black tiger sword in hand ready to strike black tiger was caught off guard what he turned his head back to dodge but it was too late a curse echoed damn it he still had Counterattack blood sprayed out the dagger he used was a styletto the modified poison capable of causing a strong special effect with a single blow against humanoid creatures at a certain level the lower the target's recovery amount the higher the activation chance there was one activation chance left for the special effect black tier was struck and fell to his knees coughing up blood cough cough you bastard daring to Ambush me from behind black Tiger's Health had decreased to 5% observing the battle situation mokai suddenly exclaimed even when he attacks he can't deal that much damage after all the level difference is too great no that dagger definitely has a special effect each electric flash surrounded black tiger he said this is my activated Guardian seal this indicates that your dagger has a oneit kill effect after activation black Tiger's Health has been restored to 30% the level 50 Guardian seal has passive immunity to the special effect of an attack that restores 30% Health the number of uses is unlimited black tiger after realizing was extremely angry roaring I bought it at an outrageous price Guardian seal you made me waste it damn it Yu also retorted continuing to attack black tiger you're blaming me isn't my special effect also Wasted by you why did your energy Shield recover so quickly Yu's attack was blocked by The Shield black tiger thought not good he's still too strong accompanied by a notice from the system please note that the passive extreme Nirvana bloodlock will end in 5 seconds black tiger blocked the attack fuming damn it I initially thought that using the power of Wong Jang group would easily complete this transaction I didn't expect halfway through that you would ruin it he swung his sword towards yiu and after killing him in mokai Black Tiger said I must definitely ask them to pay more after taking the hit and receiving the notification the passive extreme Nirvana bloodlock has ended please restore Health as soon as possible to avoid damage Yu's health bar was only at 10% black tiger pulled out a siren and said I admit I never expected I wouldn't be able to beat you tough as a cockroach like this I have to use this secret treasure trick to avoid unexpected issues saying this he stabbed the needle into his neck injected the liquid into his body and laughed leave everything to me die all of you his body was completely enveloped in a pillar of lightning a howling sound erupted he had used the blood of thunderbeast an epic item that could activate a thunderstorm electric transforming into a beast this would significantly enhance various abilities and attributes for a short period of time lasting 5 minutes seeing the scene before him ymu was astonished is this the fighting condition of a highlevel person not only can tactics change but the abilities and items the opponent can use are also unpredictable a person who is careless will be forced into despair in the same astonishment moai thought this black tiger has so many rare props normally he must spend a lot of time in the dungeon what a Pity he was originally a talent the form of black tiger gradually revealed itself after transforming as the smoke Veil dissipated he said I have passed through 56 levels of the dungeon Valley just to acquire this Epic Level item I never thought I would use it to fight against you the massive form of the thunderbeast clad in armor stood menacingly in front of deep hole black tiger said what other tricks do you have show them all so we can have a grand final to this battle hearing black Tiger's threat Yi Wu merely Shrugged and calmly replied there are no more I have no more tricks left the move I just used has exhausted everything didn't you block it all on hearing this black tiger was extremely enraged and charged straight at ywo shouting damn it are you implying that I'm useless I went through hell for this and you've wasted my precious item I'll cut you down faced with the giant figure swinging his sword towards him Yu remained unworried with his hands stuffed in his pockets responding to the insults you can eat recklessly but you shouldn't speak carelessly I'm not forcing you to use it are you sure you can kill me as black Tiger's swords rushed towards yiwu they were intercepted by two Bodyguards of mokai who appeared from nowhere black tiger suddenly exclaimed this is impossible how could you break the petrification state of the eye of Medusa before the time limit clearly the time is not up yet yiu seeing his reaction explained this is also a Stroke of Luck for you when you were explaining the petrification method I happened to be standing outside the door and overheard the conversation between you and moai M naai said could it be hang Jen group black tiger replied not bad it is indeed Wang Jen group if it worked for them providing Epic Level props Yi Wu silently stood outside the door listening to these words and thought to himself the eye of Medusa then I'll use this on myself ending his his recollection and returning to the present black tiger grasped the issue but still didn't believe it it can't be to remove the petrification state one can only use Medusa's tears but you open my treasure y Wu calmly responded I just didn't expect that the black tiger Legion would be so lacking in Treasures black tiger angrily roared damn it those are things we worked hard to acquire but before he could finish speaking two bodyguards struck him in the lower region causing him to scream in pain yiu stood before the scene and said don't worry about your wealth at this moment even if I didn't seize it you would still lose your life as soon as he finished speaking moi's two bodyguards launched an attack sending black tiger flying across several rooms leaving behind large holes in the walls seeing this Yi Wu was deeply impressed exclaiming is this the power of level 60 double the strength it really sends chills down my spine after the battle ending M spoke up and asked vwo if you had the method to break the petrification all along why didn't you do it from the beginning to save my bodyguard why fight to the end drive everyone mad and put yourself in such danger yiu replied although I thought of that now that I'm confident of Victory why not take the opportunity to confront a highlevel enemy with all my strength for me it's a precious real Combat experience that is hard to buy even with money mo Kai looked at him in Surprise I've met countless people but I never met anyone like you before Yi Wu smiled back now your experience can be refreshed once again no need to thank me it's fine they say 10 million points cannot be less I still need to earn 500,000 for my copy after all I am also the champion of the competition moii nodded smiled and said don't worry with this meager amount of money I won't be lacking in her heart she thought haha it turns out he is just an ordinary person different in that he needs money but not his life this suits my taste perfectly while the two were talking two bodyguards brought black tiger back and asked for her opinion young lady how should we deal with this person m n looked at Black Tiger coldly said this person has no value to me anymore then she turned to Yu and said give him a final blow the props and experience he has are yours Yu bowed his head and gratitude thank you young lady for your support then I won't be polite he took the sword and plunged it straight down into black tiger who was lying on the ground in his last breath black tiger uttered his dying words you you guys shouldn't be too happy too soon the beasts outside the security Zone have secretly gathered their forces already youu did not hesitate decisively killing him immediately the system announced congratulations The Host has received the elimination reward experience 100,000 money 880,000 thunderstorm electric protective gear lightning double blade and five highlevel recovery potions y Wu pondered over black Tiger's warning the Beast gather outside the safe Zone falling what does he mean by that mokai shrugg and replied this is just a conspiracy theory that has been circulated in the shadows for a long time the safe area is well protected so there's no need to worry about it then she extended her hand accompanied by an invitation vwoo do you want to join the mo attack team with your abilities and the fact that you saved my life you are more than qualified to participate upon hearing this ye Wu smiled lightly joining the mo attack team if Miss Mo doesn't mind could you briefly explain some of the benefits for me to consider Moy n slightly smirked benefits ha this still needs to be carefully considered why are you asking me do you want to know what the hanmo corporation can offer you Yi Wu quickly waved his hand in denial I wouldn't dare it's just that I have a habit of acting cautiously faking carefully before making decisions before he could react two nights seized Yoo by the shoulders their eyes glinting with Sparks warning the young lady invited you that is your honor when asking remember to consider who you are Yu began to sweat M ni smiled interjecting to reassure all right ye we saved my life he doesn't have to follow these rigid rules she turned to the two bodyguards first you go check if there's anything with the other students don't let any other mercenaries around the two bodyguards responded Yes young lady hearing this y Wu chuckled lightly and volunteered bosses about those remaining mercenaries is it possible to keep their bodies intact they could be worth money yiwu's unexpected suggest suggestion left the two bodyguards shaking their heads speechless moai laughed and replied you really like money don't you good very good Yu was a bit puzzled and asked back really good I thought you would disdain me for being greedy Moi n replied calmly in this cruel era as long as you are strong enough Duty money and power will all be within reach it's natural selection why shouldn't I look down on it moreover those who have desires share a trait a valuable character Yu was surprised not understanding what she meant by character here seeing this Moi gently stroked his cheek explaining the common trait is that you all are easily driven by your desires while I can provide all your wants and needs caught off guard by her touch Yu suddenly thought this woman is more dangerous than I imagined I must not lever Take the Lead otherwise I will be at a disadvantage M continued although your current strength is far from enough to stand at the top of the pyramid you have demonstrated the qualities and potential of a talented person I ackowledge you as a qualified Reserve Talent she continued looking directly into Yu's eyes if you ask what benefits there are in joining the mo attack team I will tell you she released a projection device and said after the position shift although it brings destruction to the old world it also brings a future to the new world this future contains numerous small and large dungeons in this era each corporate asset will have its own combat team fully training and supporting it their only purpose is to fight for the future hidden in the dungeon upon hearing this ywu thought in himself competing for resources what does competing for resources even mean competing for the future too can't they speak in a way that people understand M continued to explain we are the mo attack team with our own strength along with the powerful financial support of the hanm mo Corporation which always leads in the competition chain joining us you not only have access to the highest quality dungeon resources currently available but also enjoy the highest Priority Access more importantly you can also receive a salary that you never could have imagined before along with a share of the dungeon Revenue that everyone anticipates for example the hanmo corporation allocates dungeon resources at a ratio of 50% the dungeon ensures an income no less than 100,000 Yu's eyes went wide At The Mention Of Money and he asked wait a minute is this real m n interrupted his thoughts and said I haven't finished speaking yet don't interrupt she continued this city has a total of nine safe zones mainly located outside the urban area ranging from low to high marked by the Beast Invasion symbol with security levels at the same rank outside the safe zones lies unexplored danger zones the city is primarily controlled directly by the Affiliated Corporation where the wealthy and Powerful reside in the first to third Central zones enjoying higher Privileges and safety the central zones four to six are designated for all types of technical Talent corporate staff along with Warriors supporting development Ordinary People and those unable to fight remain in the three lower Central zones from 9 to 7 although it seems to be a comfortable and prosperous life in reality they are forgotten and abandoned she continued once the lower safe zones are at attacked by the beasts the result is nothing but Slaughter this time I originally came to visit the nemies in the safe zones to select backup talents for the combat team this Academy is the first stop and it is enough to see the management of the three low-level zones the ninth safe Zone had previously experienced a Beast Invasion incident you've heard about it joining the mo attack team means escaping from this dangerous place because team members can bring along all their family members and enjoy the right to reside in the upper three zones upon hearing this Yu's expression truly changed seeing that look on his face she thought indeed he is someone who cares for his family when it comes to family his expression becomes more serious she continued after perfectly resolving the Troubles of the team members we further support the personal equipment and medical assistance of the team members reaching the highest level HMO Corporation will manufacture exclusive weapons and equipment based on the levels and attributes of the team members to maximize their combat Effectiveness moreover our top-notch medical rescue team is always on standby ready to provide the fastest and most advanced Medical support for the team members ensuring their survival rate she went on perhaps you still have doubts about me after inflating the hand Mo Corporation and mo attack team like this why hasn't even this small threat been properly dealt with I explained that there are two reasons first I did not expect someone to DARE act so directly this is my mistake for HMO Corporation the lives of the team members are even more precious than my own the priority of rescuing me is indeed much lower than that of the team members in the team everything depends on strength faced with such great opportunities what you intend to do y wo remained calm on the outside but inside he was incredibly surprised Dan it the hanmo corporation is so wealthy and Powerful with this amount of information I can only say it's outstanding look at this Burning enthusiasm m n is truly cunning she has completely hit my weak points it's not just for my own benefit even for my sister and parents I have to agree I can only say she has a Keen Eye for people but now I am completely sober I have lost my ability to think and judge I cannot easily agree to that in this state I need to stabilize her first and then talk later after thinking Yu said this choice is too crucial for me and my family can you give me some time to think Miss SM hearing this she tossed Yu a card and said I'll give you 3 days you can use this card to contact me Yu took the card and said no problem just 10 million up front and I'll save that girl Moi n turned her back and replied there's 20 million in this card is that enough immediately he tucked the card away and said to her that's enough that's enough so I won't be polite while they were talking the Headmaster rushed in through the door and knelt down in front of m n with unprecedented speed he was crying as he said young lady please calm down I arrived late and the academy could not properly protect you causing you to be frightened if there is punishment to be handed out let it be on me alone the students and teachers are innocent in his heart he thought it's over it's over I let those mercenaries Infiltrate The Academy again moii if there is even a slight carelessness won't this Academy be burned down seeing this she said to the Headmaster please stand up this incident happened because of me which in turn has implicated the academy and many students and teachers therefore it is I who should apologize don't worry no matter how many casualties and property damage this attack has caused our hando group will fully compensate you hearing this he bowed his head in gratitude young lady you are kind and generous all the teachers and students will never forget this she said all right get out of the way don't block me Yu saw this and said all over temper is not small she is clearly not unruly she is indeed generous as expected of the young lady of the hanmo group I know she's even better than this m replied fainting flattery let's end this here 3 days from now I will leave this night safe Zone before that please give me a satisfactory answer Yu replied no problem I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer in his heart he thought the Abundant benefits seem a bit unrealistic I must stay alert think carefully and cannot let the immediate benefits blind me at the hospital room Yi Wu and his sister visited the patient his father's Health could be seen to have improved as he was walking he heard someone calling from behind classmate y woo the Headmaster rushed over grasping his hand expressing gratitude I still can't believe that you saved Miss Mo and at the same time saved our entire Academy he replied that's right Headmaster how could I allow bad people to stay in our Academy we can do whatever we want yiu patted his chest his face full of confidence as he said the common teachings of my teacher are always in my heart do not lose a strong heart just because of your weak capabilities as long as you remain strong within Miracles will always happen I never know oh no what lying is the Headmaster excitedly exclaimed no wonder you were once The Talented Youth of the academy it seems that although your rank has not been able to increase in the past 3 years you have not stopped striving y wo this time you have made a significant contribution to the Academy the school will definitely award you a special prize he turned to secretary wine and said secretary Wong please gather the teachers and students of the school I want to explain about this surprise attack more importantly I want to especially commend The Bravery of ywu the secretary replied yes he quickly interrupted another day Headmaster right now everyone is still in shock more importantly they need to be comforted and to rest also there's no need for any special Awards just make sure to convert the bonus points report cards and prize money on time the Headmaster shouted no you have over 60,000 dungeon points plus an additional bonus of 500,000 totaling just over 1,100,000 this meager amount cannot compare to your contribution the special Awards cannot be less Yu replied good that's good he really had a bias against the headmaster's bombastic way of speaking and thought to himself few you've startled me Headmaster could you please not speak so forcefully he bowed to the Headmaster and said if there's nothing else I'll head home now goodbye Headmaster the Headmaster patted him on the shoulder and said said good the academy will close for 3 Days starting tomorrow so make sure to take this opportunity to rest well he changed his mind about ywu thinking to himself what a hero emerging from ordinary youth the most ordinary person yet capable of Performing such a remarkable deed xong chongin Dand do secretary Wong informed the finance department to prepare 2 million and that thing in 3 days at the conference I will personally reward Yu the secretary bowed his head and replied yes Yu perked up his ears evees dropping on the conversation and wondered what is that thing it can't be that legendary item can it as DUS gradually fell at the hospital a joyful cry rang out you you have come he asked Yun Fe is Dad okay in the hospital room his father replied Shia woo I am fine the wife anxiously said don't get up too sudden suddenly lie down you still need to rest the daughter also expressed concern that's right Dad the state of poisoning has been suppressed but has not been completely eliminated it will take time to recover gradually yiwu's expression became pensive gradual recovery means dad has to endure pain for a long time is there any quicker treatment while he was thinking his younger sister placed her hand on his shoulder and asked brother how did the dungeon competition go today you well right he replied of course your brother suddenly a doctor walked in and said oh everyone is here right let me introduce you this is Dean Jong of our hospital he just returned to the hospital today and heard that he wanted to meet you this person is the dean of Moselle Hospital named Jang yanu he said I heard that everyone had a conflict with director fan last time and here I want to apologize to everyone after all Dr prioritize the people and his way of doing things somewhat goes against medical principles Yi Wu smiled thank you Dean for coming here especially apologizing is no problem I should also apologize I was a bit impulsive I will compensate for director fans medication costs he thought to himself although he is a high-ranking superior to personally come here to apologize is quite conscientious Jong yanu turned to leave and said yes nowadays there are very few young people like you who dare the act and take responsibility You all take a good rest I will be leaving seeing him about to leave he quickly stopped him wait a moment Dean Jong he asked again about the manner he had been pondering is there any immediate way to treat my father's current condition at your hospital he replied an immediate cure I have previously looked into your father's condition to recover immediately a special antidote is required in other words a high-grade detoxification drug allthough our Hospital has this type of antidote is very expensive because it is an epic drug seeing this his father quickly intervened sh woo I'm fine I just need to rest a little longer to recover there's no need to waste money y wo ignored the situation and pulled out a power card saying the hospital is fine the price doesn't matter it's all on the card seeing that card D Jong was startled his eyes wide as he asked this this is the young lady's Black Card how do you have this he scratched his head in confusion this was given to me by Moi n from the hanm group what's going on is it not usable the dean emphasized it is then he changed his attitude and smiled responding are you kidding me the young lady's Black Card how could it not be usable this card can be extravagantly spent at any Enterprise of the handm group he turned around and ordered you there doctor don't hurry to the insurance storage to get a highgrade no get three high-grade antidote pills for me and then transfer this esteemed patient to our most expensive VIP Suite the doctor bowed his head and replied yes yes Woo's family members were still in a days not understanding what was happening the dean looked at them and then smiled brightly to explain because our hospital is also a branch of the hando group seeing this black card is like seeing the young lady herself I apologize every one for previously being negligent these three high-grade antidote pills will be a gift for you sha wo was dumbfounded thinking in astonishment damn I didn't expect this card to be like that m n is even more generous than I thought gun Fay approached him and asked how did you get the Black Card of the young lady from hanmo group did something happen he raised the card and smiled it's a long story when the opportunity arises I will tell you all about it in detail suddenly the doctor from earlier ran into the room quickly shouting Dean it's not good the high-grade antidote in the storage is gone not just the high-grade antidote but also all the rare medicinal materials have disappeared Jong Yan Shu and Y Wu anxiously asked what his face turned angry thinking to himself damn it why is everything going wrong now everything was finally about to change how could this happen the stolen medicines must be the work of an Insider wait a minute the culprit can't be Dean Jong angrily asked so did you find out who took the high-grade medicines the doctor replied Dean I just reviewed the camera footage it was director fan who took them his expression darkened and he gritted his teeth saying this foolish man I will never forgive him in his heart he cursed I shouldn't have brought him in here he is the bane of this hospital but right now the most important thing was to deal with the immediate situation Jong Y show bent down and said I'm sorry sir I'm sorry everyone we were too careless I truly apologize please rest assured I will proceed with a special treatment method although it cannot be cured immediately it can expedite the recovery process in his heart yuu had already guessed it seemed he was not mistaken indeed that person did it he replied it doesn't matter Dean do you know besides the hospital where else I can buy high-grade antidotes Dean Jong answered high-grade antidotes are a special kind of item they are always invaluable you can try your luck at the auction house since you are a friend of the young lady you can go directly to her the young lady will definitely have them as the high-grade medicines in our Hospital are all supplied by the hanmo group he declined forget it let me find another way Yu put his hands on his hips pondering I shouldn't rely too much on her if something happens it will be extremely difficult to solve the problem thinking it over he said to him forget it let me find another way JN yanelle also felt very guilty and bowed his head saying yes yes I really couldn't help it's truly too shameful saying this he quickly turned to the doctor and instructed wait a moment transfer this patient to the VIP room provide the best equipment and nurses how Ren replied yes Dean suddenly yiu spoke up by the way there's one one more thing thanks to Dr Hall our family was able to receive timely medical assistance this time I think doctors like him should be valued how Ren was surprised and said W woo the dean placed a hand on his shoulder praising him that's right that's right I have been keeping an eye on Dr how's professionalism and character conveniently the head position in our hospital is currently vacant how Ren you should take that position he expressed his deep gratitude and agreed yes thank you for the nomination thank you yay y Wu waved his hand and turned around no need no need this is what you deserve all right you should go now you have to come back here to arrange things for my dad too Dr how hurriedly left not forgetting to respond all right all right returning to his father's hospital bed he instructed dad make sure to rest well in the hospital just leave the antidote to me Mr y Wu anxiously said Shia woo if you can't buy it don't force it I'm worried he replied awkwardly what hardships what hardships mom his mother also said that's right Sha woo even though our family isn't wealthy we don't compromise our principles for money Chen's younger sister spoke boldly to do something to be taken care of by a wealthy lady you really are something hurry and tell me how you managed to conquer M this distinguished wealthy lady in just one short day ywo shouted in despair can you all stop thinking nonsense what kind of person do you think my son is don't you both know all three looked at him chuckling teasing really y Yun F secretly thought looking at his unclear expression there must be some hidden story in this she excitedly said I've made my decision brother I want to go with you to find the highlevel antidote he responded in Surprise ah this is something I can do alone thankfully you're already well it's best if you stay in the hospital to rest with tearful eyes she clasped her hands and pleaded with her brother please agreed to take me sitting here in the hospital is going to be boring soon moreover I also want to hear about what happened in the dungeon where you competed he helplessly agreed all right all right all right but you must listen to me do not run around Yun Fe pouted I know really I'm not a three-year-old child her father teased back in my heart as long as you're not married you're still just a three-year-old she acted cute with her dad making her older brother and mother burst into laughter ha as night fell the two siblings were heading out yanf exclaimed oh so you're not just the top in the competitive dungeon but you also saved m n I told you my brother is the best he replied discontentedly is 20 million not a small amount after all M's life is priceless she suddenly noticed the worried look on the face that's right but why we have to go to this dangerous Black Market isn't it safer to go to the auction house y Wu explained the black market may not be safe but it has the most comprehensive options with me here you won't be in danger his sister felt more at ease and responded all right he also felt confident thinking that the money he had would greatly help him that's right although this is only our second time coming here this time it's completely different from before besides gaining strength what's more important is that we have money suddenly three thugs appeared arrogantly and said here to live looking up at their information panel the first Thug a was level 10 Thug B was level 9 and Thug C was level 9 they threatened in turn if you want to leave you have to pay the toll that's right pay up quickly you can't run away Kid Yun feay realized they were robbers always waiting here she stood up walked for forward and said you you go ahead I'll stay back to deil with them Thug spoke up quite maliciously I like looking at you level four trash a man needing a woman to protect him isn't that a freeloader pathetic it's better for me to reconsider a bit I don't need to use all my strength Yi Wu closed his eyes inside then said Fay you need to change this habit of yours a little don't just jump in front whenever trouble arises you are still quite weak she wondered brother he replied calmly I already said from now on everything related to fighting and killing will be handled by me I won't let you suffer any harm anymore a Burly Thug stepped forward placing a hand on Yu's shoulder and said stop pretending consider yourself lucky kid today my brothers and I are only here to Rob money not to take your life you want to go to the black market then hand over the money or anything valuable you have on you otherwise don't don't even think about leaving here alive Yu stood firm showing no fear and replied you are the lucky ones I don't want to kill in front of my family if you want live you best step aside the thuga went mad and shouted kiddo you were about to die and still speak bravely I'll punch you in the head and see how you can withstand that just then the leader was suddenly struck by a sword that flew straight into his forehead dying on the spot a man's voice rang out you just a level four kid you shouldn't provoke a level 12 scoundrel so carelessly the thugs underling yelled boss who's the brave fool that dared to Ambush our leader the man questioned back Ambush don't put it that way before anyone could comprehend y Wu barely caught a glimpse of the figure rushing in directly killing the two underlings not forgetting to taunt the scum do you really think you needed to Ambush they only had time to shout and yanf immediately asked who is it the man with the long sword slung over his back slowly turned his face replying me haha I'm just an unknown person passing by and encountering an injustice so I came to lend a hand y Wu suspiciously inquired by the way you just seiz the stage claiming to be a humble passer by that's a bit much don't you think my friend who are you y Yan FEI standing beside them looked as if she had lost her soul thinking to herself oh so cool classmate and Chang casually rested his sword on his shoulder boldly stating don't worry about the details whether or not he's handsome doesn't matter for men the key is to show off y Wu was taken back secretly thinking show off so this is why he stole my experience points yanf was still mesmerized her eyes shining brightly thinking this person is really too handsome but why does he look a bit familiar yiu shook his head secretly thinking fool this is not the time to be infatuated with handsome guys danger is everywhere no time for foolish thoughts stay alert seeing his sister like this his face showed a hint of frustration as he glanced at her with half an eye thinking to himself yayun Fe what on Earth are you up to and Chang said sternly the black market around here is not a place for play you guys at this level dare to rush in if not go ahead to lysan Y Wu immediately replied of course no one is foolish enough to State their life for a joke and Chang suddenly suggested then if that's the case the two of you should follow me I happen to have business in the black market I know this place very well with me here you two will be absolutely safe saying that he reached out his hand implying he wanted to lead them along yanf quickly leaned closer to Y Wu and whispered brother I have something to tell you he curiously asked what is it she spoke sofly carefully saying he must be trying to deceive us if not why would he try to ingratiate himself with us like this even if he helps us that doesn't prove he's a good person besides what we have on us after she finished speaking he interrupted I know your brother is not an idiot though they were Whispering they completely forgot about the other party and Shang smiled with his eyes squinting having a high level of vigilance is a good thing but I truly have no ulterior your motives both of you are students of the Academy I as a former student of the Academy have the Goodwill to help younger students that's quite normal yanf was startled and turned back to say alum her face lit up as she continued I remember now are you the legendary figure of the academy and Chang no wonder you look a bit familiar y Wu was still recalling senior and Chang that name sounds familiar and Chain's current level is 30 and all his skills are at 100% s he spoke up that's right I am indeed an Chang I just didn't expect that even after graduating several years ago the academy would still be passing down legends about me at this moment Yu remembered that enchain was hailed as the greatest genius the academy had ever seen after just one year in the academy he was appointed to a battle team role by the time he graduated he had reached level 20 if it weren't for his concerns relying solely on his own strength would truly be astonishing but in the end this person became better known among the female student group perhaps because of his handsome appearance at this time the sun was slowly setting and Chang urged the two you two should have settled down by now right hurry with me here you will be very safe Yu replied then thank you and Chang for taking care of us Gan Fe still had doubts turned to yiu and said to him even if he is our senior do you really trust trust him he replied it's fine let's keep an eye on him for now we'll see how things go Yu is also not someone who easily trusted others he thought to himself in this era you can't fully trust anyone except your own family and Chang is only level 30 if he really wants to take the initiative to gain experience points I have no reason to refuse he started a conversation within Chang senior Anne I heard that when you entered School you were assigned to a professional team so which team are you currently contributing to the senior replied hang Jen group also known as the seor team Yi Yun Fe expressed admiration upon hearing this the seor team that's the team that ranks just behind the Mong team right senior you are really impressive he scratched his head awkwardly haha actually I'm not that impressive because based on my current level and abilities I'm just in the reserve Squad of the team not a full member of the team y Wu walked while thinking the people of w Jen group are really fiful if I give the order the account will be transferred to Crazy Moss the system confirmed the command the main account has been transferred to Crazy Moss immediately afterwards a robot appeared and announced dear Master you called ad Vis what can I do for you YW asked AV Vis where can I get the tool the kind that can investigate the target I Vis replied surveillance do you mean to investigate specifically in which aspect checking physical condition or seeing through y Wu is taken AB seeing through is there such an improper tool thinking of the scene where he could see through the underwear of girls made him nosebleed I viz teased of course there is nothing you can't do only things you don't think of but with your current level you can't manufacture this scene through tool y Wu covered his precious parts and shouted that's impossible he asked seriously again what I mean is is there a tool that can tell if someone is lying through their breathing and heartbeat I viz answered so that's it such a simple thing I can do a vis said it's just a way to judge whether someone is lying or not through heart rate and respiration because many people can be trained to hide their emotions I on the other hand used the Spectrum to observe the Target and the organism's magnetic field fluctuations to make judgments absolutely accurate y Wu then came up with an idea not wanting to delay he approached his sister Yuni and asked quietly who do you think is more handsome me or senior nchang she curiously asked huh why are you suddenly asking me such silly questions y Wu urged you just need to answer yanf confidently replied is there even a question in my heart you are the most handsome no doubt about it I this pointed directly at her and said she is lying ye Young she is actually more into handsome guys than her own brother this left him speechless indeed women are not to be trusted y Wu also began his plan to probe and Chang he asked senior have you heard about any recent incidents at the Academy it seems to be somewhat related to the Huang Jen group right and Chang asked again I'd never heard of this what's going on has something happened between the academy and the whole Jen group I visz analyzed and gave the result although the is very suspicious he is not lying Yu was surprised by ad's result he's not lying that means he poses no threat to us at the moment and chain hurriedly make up a story no no it's just that some classmates mentioned the emperor team of the group he scratched his head confused what is this story how come I don't know isn't this recruitment something our Reserve team is doing Yu chuckled so you really don't know H after walking for a while both of them stopped in front of a building there was a voice calling from afar oh is that and Chang the three of them chatted happily The Tall Man asked long time no see how have you been lately and Chang also shared hello to both of you I've been busy practicing with the team today I was specially approved a day off so I have time to come here silly G opened the door saying is that so then you have to work harder the competition for the official position on the team is very fierce come in and Chang replied that's right the attrition rate is relatively High every day I'm exhausted to the point of wanting to die The Tall Man encouraged him with your talent you will surely be able to speak soon he gradually stepped inside not forgetting to express his thanks thank you for your kind wishes I will definitely strive to become a core member as soon as possible and not let you down before ni could finish his sentence ye Wu suddenly shouted to stop him and Chang quickly said wait a moment this is my friend please give me some face upon hearing this the two others became delighted running closer to Yu brother Y is here come have a smoke brother y this is the Magic Eye of the superior magic Crystal please enjoy and Chang was startled thinking seriously what is this what kind of situation is this this person is welcome even more than I am Yu raised his hand to decline I am a student I don't smoke besides you don't need to Pander to me this makes me a bit uncomfortable the two still remained excited admiring him saying look your story is being widely circulated in the black market and you even publicly declined the invitation from moai to join the mo attack team that's really impressive Yu replied I have long forgotten the troubles from before all right I'm in a hurry please let me in y Yan FEI curious asked is it Mo attack team Yu did not expect the news to spread here so quickly he thought to himself it's impressive how fast news travels truly a black market both men welcomed him with bright faces yes yes brother yay you are so magnanimous please come in the ground here is a bit slippery so be careful y Wu quickly called out and Chang senior let's go and Chang was still in a days and replied ah um okay yanf fueled by his curiosity chased after his brother and asked wait for me did M naai invite you to join the mo attack team what happened yiu only responded this is a long story and Chang behind them was deep in thought this is no joke is it m n lofty and esteemed would invite someone with only level four to join the mo attack team this relationship might be a bit problematic looks like like I should keep a good eye on this person inside the Black Market Hall the atmosphere was extremely Lively many people were com and going chatting with each other and some were even drinking yi yan feay looked around in confusion is this really the black market that people talk about the vibe is completely different from what I imagined it's as vibrant as a bar as she walked she kept glancing about I thought the people here would be very Wicked and that it would be a dangerous place hearing her say this senior and Chang raised his hand to introduce although it is a black market it also has its own rules anyone who enters here must abide by them what you see now is just the surface y wo with his hands in his pockets leisurely walked in front and having been curious all along asked so according to what the senior said is there a darker side to the black market and Chang raised a finger to his lips signaling don't talk about topics that are not appropriate for the level here just spend as much as you wish Yu replied got it he turned his head back looking politely at in Chang thank you senior for bringing my brother and me here you shouldn't delay your own matters you go and handle your work and Chang cheerfully responded waving his hand no need to thank me I indeed have matters to attend to suddenly as if he remembered something he yelled oh right Yu wondered looking at the system interface that displayed the information and Chang wants to add you as a good friend do you agree or not with two response options agree and disagree at this moment and Chang continued if we have such a fate and are studying at the same Academy why not become friends if you have any problems you can contact me hearing this y Wu happily replied thank you senior and Chang for your concern after saying that he clicked on the agree button on the system interface the system displayed the message successfully added friend you two have become good friends you can now start chatting before turning to leave and Chang wave goodbye no need be so polite once you finish your business it's best to Le quickly this place is not safe for you both y Wu quickly responded understood watching him walk away Yu thought to himself it seems I've successfully attracted the attention of senior and Chang my intuition tells me that even if he wasn't lying before he is still very suspicious I must be careful yi yan Fe looked around curiously and asked this place is so vast but where do we go to buy medicine in response to his younger sister's question Yi Wu was momentarily taken aback and replied I don't know this either he thought the last time I came here I was directly led into a private room and I didn't have the opportunity for a direct transaction it seems I need asked more people suddenly feeling a strange sensation Yi Wu glanced over his shoulder pondering this feeling is like I'm being watched he saw a girl with a cgit beautiful face holding a glass of wine but her gaze was directed towards him yiwu suspected she was staring intently at him when the girl noticed yiwu looking at her she spoke up hey handsome are you staring at me are you wanting to invite me for a drink y Yuni witnessing this immediately reached out her hand and interjected sorry my brother is not interested in starting a conversation he's still young Yu standing next to her could only chuckle at his sister's words thinking calmly suddenly the girl in front of him burst into loud laughter interrupting his train of thought haha you two are really funny little sister I was just joking with your brother you look so tense after saying that she stood up bent down and reached into the area inside the bar counter the short dress only covered her rear showcasing her alluring curves she then asked are you Mr y Wu wondered as he looked at her how do you know my name right now she stood up and introduced herself no need to doubt your story has been widely circulated in our hanmo group my name is SAU and I am the representative of hanmo group here in yiwu's mind the name a is emerged with a voice echoing to confirm the owner although she is not lying her entire being radiates a pink Spectrum which shows at this moment a small robot appeared happily saying she really wants to seduce you haha hearing this yiu was starled and raised his hands in surrender all right no need to say anything unnecessary just wait suddenly saou approached wrapped her arm around Yo's pressing it against her chest then said come after that she leaned close to Yu's ear and whispered let me take you to the private room of HMO group then pausing for a moment she slowly continued you can do whatever you want Yu listened to her words staring blankly at her saying we are just here to buy before he could finish his SS saou joyfully pressed her body against his arm and cheerfully said hurry up and get to the main business this remark from her left the men around in astonishment unable to close their mouths the bald man caught off guard suddenly shouted damn it who is this person that he can walk arm in-arm with the beauty saou the long-haired man in a white shirt standing standing next to him was both annoyed and envious yelling damn it I usually don't dare to approach her yet this guy Yan FEI standing behind was so angry she felt like she could smoke clenching her fists and stomping her feet cursing silently in her heart this Vixen I must protect him well I can't let him be seduced by this inconsistent woman at this moment they had arrived in front of the private room of the hanmo group standing before the large door adorned with with strange shapes SAU introduced this is the private room of the hanm grou as she spoke she pulled Yu into the brightly lit circular room here you can enjoy the highest VIP treatment any service you desire y yanf followed them in both angry and trying to find a wave interrupt between these two can we talk business stop clinging to my brother let go now y Wu looked up at the glowing square shape floating in the air and asked is this the trading terminal on the black market it's really convenient saiou hearing him ask that also looked up at the square shape and replied trading terminals are all available on the black market and are the primary method of trading but most of the trading rights are only at the basic level she placed her hands on her hips looked at ywu and continued this terminal from HMO group has the highest trading Authority that means as long as you have the money you can use it to buy top tier Goods both rare and mysterious that are not available on the market you who approached the square shape and reached out to touch its surface I'm not interested in top tier goods and I don't have the money to buy them the purpose of my visit here is at that moment information about a red vial appear on the screen with the description seller brother fan the most handsome in history high-grade antidote stockpiled three vials price 600,000 per vial upon seeing the information just displayed Yu was secretly pleased I found it it really is for sale but then he paused thinking the price this person is selling in his mind the image of a chubby man wearing square glasses and bald appeared he thought to himself this must be director fan who hasn't fled but from beginning to end there's something suspicious about this he continued theoretically the director of the hospital holds a high-paying position why would you risk stealing medicine to sell for money what exactly has happened yi yan FEI standing next to iwu also saw the information displayed on the screen she sighed and said brother this medicine is too expensive one vial costs an exorbitant price saou over here also frowned and said indeed although this antidote is rare 100,000 for a vial is already too high if he sells it for 600,000 it must definitely be before she could finish her sentence Yi Wu spoke up but he is the only one on the trading floor selling this medicine the high price is quite reasonable I definitely want to buy this medicine but it has to be done through a different method having said that he looked at saou and asked saou I want to make a transaction what do I need to do saou replied the transaction can be face Toof face or direct trading Li the device is also fine but in the end the seller must agree y Wu quickly added then please help me clarify a bit upon hearing that saou knelt down sat lower and typed on the screen to gather information then responded all right just a moment after that she ordered her subordinate Master Control help me contact the person who just sold the high-grade antidote I want to make a face-to-face transaction with him as soon as he finished speaking someone quickly responded I will contact you immediately please wait a moment a while later a message appeared on the screen unfortunately the seller refused es to carry out the transaction yuu standing beside quickly said please contact the seller again as long as he agrees to a direct transaction I am willing to raise the price to 1 million as soon as he finished speaking someone immediately replied okay please wait ye them Fe hearing her brother say that anxiously asked this medicine is priced at 600,000 which is already an astronomical price why you want to raise it to 1 million hearing his sister 's question Yu turned to look at Yan and then smiled to reassure her calm down pie pie your brother is not foolish I intentionally raised the price to lure the other party into a trap as long as the other side agrees to meet for a direct transaction I can guarantee to get the ba vial of medicine without spending a penny seeing her brother so confident yanf exclaimed in Surprise is that true at that moment a notification appeared on the screen the seller agrees to a direct transaction and is rushing over please wait outside there was a commotion what is this a man's loud voice echoed I really need to use the restroom let me go already then a voice urged hurry up you're taking too long do you think this is a market the door swung open the man in his suit Stout in appearance was shoved Inside by two security guards almost losing his balance angrily he shouted Ed you little brats I'm a guest how dare you push me like that Yu sat in the middle of the room resting his chin on his hand coldly looking at him and saying finally you've arrived the man stammered you you are looking at the young man in front of him he suddenly broke into a cold sweat in his mind he thought this kid how could he get into the VIP room of Han calm down I can't let this kid find out about everything yian Fe stood next to yiu pointing at him and asked her brother brother this old man looks very familiar it seems he is the one the little girl's inquiry startled her she shouted loudly nonsense who are you how could you get in here stand up straight and talk properly who is the one buying the medicine hurry up and come out I don't have time for this yuo smirked haha indeed you are the culprit the wound on your hand hasn't even healed yet already outs selling medicine his right hand was bandaged tightly he stared at ywo in Terror thinking to himself is this kiddo Clairvoyant how can it be damn it I need to think of a way to run away quickly this person is too dangerous with that thought he immediately turned to flee but was blocked by the two bodyguards from before he gritted his teeth and cursed at them hey do you have any idea who I am this person must be lying how could he possibly have 3 million this this deal has to end let me go at that moment y Wu spoke up from behind calm down director he pulled out a black card with 3 million I have it shall we seal a deal saou looked astonished at the card this is how you have that card that's Miss Mo's card she stood with her arms crossed calmly saying as far as I know no matter how much money is on that card that card the noble black card has a value of 50 million the man exclaimed in shock 50 million he fearfully glanced over at y Wu how can this person not only have that card but also be related to m is he being supported by her Yu stood up looked at him with a smile and squinted her eyes looks like I mistook the wrong person he continued I thought you were the one injured by director fan I felt guilty so I raised the price for this deal since you said that then I guess we should before he could finish his sentence the man hurriedly interrupted wait wait a minute he raised his bandaged hand and with the other hand quickly removed his wig the past is the past no need to bring it up moreover your words have touched me he took off his glasses and wig quickly moved forward his eyes bright as he looked at gu wo and said therefore I agree with everything we just discussed so let's finalize the deal right now after seeing the true appearance of this man y yanf angrily wanted to jump up pointing at him and exclaiming so this old man is you supporting her shoulders to keep her steady Yi Wu frowned at the man all right but before that I want to check the goods is that okay the man cheerfully took a box from inside his coat saying ah yes of course he opened the box revealing three test tubes each tube contained the liquid that radiated light look this is high level antidote it can resolve any toxin I went through a lot of trouble to obtain it and I'm selling it to you the price of 1 million per bottle is already very cheap YW look down at the vials of antidote appearing excited oh such valuable medicine how could the director have obtained it but wait there are some words written on the surface of this bottle including Mo shell hospital he panicked quickly closing the box and clutching it tightly to his body saying loudly you must have seen it wrong in his heart he felt unreasonable fear thinking I have already dealt with this batch of medicine how could there be words on it does this kid know something y Wu calmly looked at him and said ah I remember now I heard that the hospital had three vials of top antidotes stolen surely director fan couldn't be the one to take them upon hearing this question the man sweated even more quickly responding of of course not how could I have taken them are you accusing me he clutched the medicine box and quickly turned to run I'm not doing business anymore this deal ends here in his heart he secretly cursed damn it this kid knows everything I must escape suddenly someone spoke up stop right there he looked up in Fright at two bodyguards blocking his way are you trying to violate the selling regulations here get out of my way sau's sharp gaze shy at him saying this is the property of hanmo group it has nothing to do with the black market as for you we will investigate and provide you with an explanation where are the people she just ordered the two bodyguards immediately capture him director fan shouted angrily let me go this isn't over yet you are framing me I will definitely make you pay for this saou frowned at him feeling a bit worried she was thinking compensation if he's not actually the culprit then yumu suddenly said don't worry she listened carefully as he continued if he is truly innocent I will compensate him sufficiently the man handed the antidote box to The Bodyguard his crafty face smiling at ewu that's according to your words don't run away hurry and check it he said to The Bodyguard investigate quickly restore my innocence inside he felt a bit pleased thinking to himself if you want to play then I'll play with you too I've already prepared for this even if you investigate there won't be anything saou held the vial of medicine in her hand observing it carefully m this medicine at first glance it doesn't seem to be from hanmo group but if it really is from our hanmo group then her eyes suddenly emitted a strange blue light yiu noticed and was astonished thinking oh it seems like her eyes have been enhanced and upgraded after a moment sau's face darkened as she turned and ordered quickly drag him Away director fan angrily shouted what the hell he was restrained by two bodyguards and pressed to the ground let me go what are you doing do you even know what you're doing let me go do you have any evidence to arrest me saou lifted her foot and stomped on his face huh evidence saou stood on his face and he cried out in pain ah saou leaned down looking at him do you think that just changing a little is enough to fool me do you think our Corporation is just a simple name let me tell you some things that you don't know when a new drug is developed the pupils in her eyes turned blue again sweeping over the vial there are many different things in the drug and secret compounds are used to avoid being detected as fake there must be a special way to identify them for example my eyes he panicked and begged I was wrong please spare me I'll return them please let me go saou frowned and with those green eyes her face looked extremely Fierce only just realizing if you want to blame someone blame your bad luck for encountering me daring to embezzle to steal from the company but those who do not work yet demand to reap benefits can only be Yu felt a bit strange but the company is large and it's easy to bypass security in a safe area so he seems like y y FEI curiously asked are you really planning to kill him sa you looked at him sneering kill I don't want to soil My Hands director fan hearing that he wouldn't be killed happily admitted that's right I'm just a piece of trash a filthy scoundrel not worth getting your hands dirty as long as you lift your foot and spare me I will be grateful saiou commanded someone quickly throw him into the danger zone for the beasts to eat director fan shivered at this moment he cried and begged huh what oh I know I was wrong kill me quickly kill me even in death I do not want to be eaten by the beasts suddenly he burst into laughter saying let me go you fools haha do you think you can live long not for long this entire area will soon be besieged by beasts you will all die only the cold worlds Kings Landing Club can save Humanity he shouted frantically cold world Kings Landing Club Long Live you who felt that there seemed to be something hidden in this cold world King's Landing Club a cult this sounds like a piece of secret information since the world entered the O era countless Cults have emerged but I have never heard of this name before before he suddenly realized this can't be a coincidence something must be about to happen I need to prepare quickly Yi Yun Fe noticed the suspicious point and said oh by the way director fan is also from hanmo company right doesn't he fear the consequences of stealing could it be that what he said is true that a monster is about to attack so he stole to sell and make money to escape yiu secretly sighed reasonable good thinking that's my sister if what she says is true then the safe zone is saou patted yanf on the shoulder reassuring her don't worry these words have been around for a long time so don't think too much about it yanf asked in confusion what she recounted since the establishment of safe zone no nine it has undergone countless battles with monsters yet it still emerged Victorious without facing any danger she said first although it is not a place with a high level of sec security it does not mean that there is no strength to fight back second the location of the safe area has been chosen where the density and strength of the monsters are lower so there is no need to worry I see saou tossed the medicine box toward guwu surprising him a bit is it really that easy to give the medicine to me she gestured according to regulations if company assets are lost whoever finds them gets to keep them moreover she leaned closer to yiu playfully implying something making him feel a bit awkward how are you planning to thank me I just helped you save 3 million so what do you want if it's within my ability sau's expression was somewhat seductive and yiwu's heart raced are you that worried if you don't have much experience don't worry I'll teach you everything waiting for Yu's reply he found himself being pulled away by his sister Yan F angrily said aren't you going to thank her my brother is still y he can't handle this kind of stimulation at that moment he was still stunned by his sister's words saou quickly explained don't worry little sister it's just drinking Yun F skeptically asked really she signaled to The Bodyguard quick bring the 21-year-old flame Burning Love bottle here Yu spoke up if you help me save 3 million I will invite you but if possible I would like to hear more about the previous issue can you elaborate on that saou said nothing but handed him a glass of wine why waste time on such dull matters if you want I can give you my address and we can talk all night he hadn't even taken the wine when his sister tugged at him sorry but we have to go now we need to bring the medicine back for father so don't make everyone worry yiu quickly said wait wait a minute there's still something else besides the cost of the medicine I plan to buy equipment for you but now we've already saved enough for the medicine too so the budget we have right now is more than 3 million y Yan Fe couldn't even dream of that what 3 million am I hearing you wrong he reassured her calm down I always think of you the top priority now is to upgrade your equipment if anything happens in the future you can protect father and mother in my place that way I can fight with peace of mind without waiting for him to continue explaining she opened the shopping system of course what should iy by now there are so many options Yu looked a bit helplessly at her this girl is truly something The Bodyguard walked over to inform saou it's time she turned to Yu and asked there will be a secret auction later do you want to participate he was a bit curious really I've never heard of it before saou explained this is a monthly event here but to participate you need 20 million in cash to ensure you can afford it the minimum trans trans action in the black market is Diamond VIP and above however the items sold there are all precious items obtained from raing the dungeon he hesitated a little but still felt intrigued sounds interesting but do I qualify to join SAU pointed out don't worry as a representative of hanmo group I can bring you in each Corporation has two participation rights he turned to his sister and instructed then you stay here don't wander around ye YF was busy choosing equipment only responding casually I know why is this weapon so expensive despite its high attack power y w could only laugh and silently Marvel indeed women are most serious when shopping all right let's go at that moment saou opened the dungeon which surprised him a bit ha a teleportation gate does this auction take place somewhere else saou explained of course that is an important Place how could it happen here the event takes place in a completely safe location with a total of nine entrances Yu was surprised oh there are actually nine entrances this is the first time I've heard of that saou continued although they don't have the power of the hando group they still rank in the top 10 not only in these nine safe zones but there are also black markets in other areas SAU pulled him into the dungeon all right let's hurry up and go yiu was quite excited for the auction I still have money but it seems unnecessary now I need to prepare quickly I still have 17 million to spend I'm not sure if that will be enough I don't know how it will go but it seems like the place is worth looking forward to scene changed saou and Y Wu dressed in black cloaks entered the auction room upon arrival he asked what's with this cloak saou simply said here identity is a secret so wearing this cloak will help us conceal our identities he found it quite interesting thinking to himself so that's why this makes sense there is always some caution among people saou then introduced this auction area is extremely vast it requires a lot of money and effort to build this place he looked up and surveyed the entire auditorium marveling at the opulence of the place indeed this is truly a mysterious location saou said sit down quickly it's about to start at that moment the MC of the auction suddenly appeared it's a pleasure to meet you all welcome to the auction Market I am the host and I'm delighted to meet you yuu looked at the host and silently mused what a weird style this is so strange he summoned avz system can you assist me in this auction Iz explained based on the items I will provide an accurate rating of 15 Stars according to their attributes to help the master avoid wasteful spending I will assist the master in purchasing suitable items he felt a bit hopeful great this skill is quite useful do you have any other skills I Vis thought for a moment caught off guard by his question currently no if the master wants more skills please upgrade the account linkage level the higher the better he felt a bit disheartened all right I will find a way to upgrade later then suddenly I Vis informed him senior and Chang is also here Master there's a situation the person on stage stood firm and a Halo radiated from his right hand that person was in Chang someone y Wu had met before he was quite surprised what senior and Chang how could he be here he thought to himself as a reserve member with his financial backing he shouldn't be able to appear here it seems that this guy has quite a few Secrets the host shouted are you all in this auction there will be 10 highly valuable items which lucky person will main them to not waste your time let's move on to the first item as soon as the first item was presented it immediately attracted numerous gazes what a highlevel item moreover it's level 70 the host introduced this item was obtained by a group of mercenaries from a very difficult dungeon this item also helps the user level up therefore the starting price is 1 million each bid must be at least 500,000 level 70 ancient Magic pistol don't miss the chance to level up immediately many people in the hall began to bid 1,500,000 I bid 2 million saou found it strange that he wasn't bidding this is a great item are you considering buying it I know you're trying to hide your true level but maybe you're not even at level 70 yet she said so this is really suitable indeed it could not be overlooked someone named Vis stated the value of this item is two stars because it means nothing to the owner there's no need to buy it he agreed I think so too at that moment someone bid 3 million causing a stir in the hall oh 3 million who bids higher than 3 million 3 million once 3 million twice congratulations the level 70 ancient magic Crystal belongs to you he realized that the buyer was none other than senior and Chang he thought to himself 3 million for a starter item is it really worth it or is there something manipulating everything here now let's move on to the next item the atmosphere in the auction room heated up as the participants eagerly awaited sensing their anticipation the host quickly transitioned to the second item which was a bleeding control potion when used your blood will not decrease for 30 seconds he continuously explained the benefits of this item to appeal to the biders we all know this is an incredibly rare potion with exceptional quality it will prevent your blood from decreasing for up to 30 seconds seconds the starting price is 2 million the host continued each price increase must be no less than 500,000 let's start the auction the system is focusing on analyzing this item at most it is a one-star item the owner has unlocked the master of alchemy account once leveled up these items are not ordinary at all after receiving this advice yiu was surprised to hear about its utility so that's how powerful it is oh so there's no need to worry about running out of medicine and making extra money that's great he was very eager for everyone to bid quickly to get to the next item the host said 4.5 million first call is there anyone willing to bid higher 4.5 million second call 4.5 million third call congratulations to VIP customer 11 for successfully bidding at the price of 4.5 million without keeping the biders waiting any longer we will move on to the next item this is a rare item that allows the user to fly in the sky it is the sucra cloak perhaps everyone already knows the function of this item once used the user can fly in the air for 5 minutes the maximum height is 20 M the cooldown time is 24 hours the presenter's incredibly engaging introduction stirred excitement throughout the auction room leading to Lively discussions the starting price is 3 million with each bid increasing by no less than 1 million surely many people were curious to buy it however the system quickly analyzed honestly with airplanes in the world who needs this planning to be a superhero one star y woo too excited immediately wanted to bid shouting I want this worried that he might lose control of his emotions after the presenter's enticing words and waste money on an undeserving item the system quickly advised Master don't buy it this is really not worth it after thinking for a while and assessing the the necessity of the sucra cloak he nodded in agreement even though I really want to own it yes you're right I shouldn't waste money one by one the guests stated their bids 4 million For the First Time 5 million the entire Auditorium suddenly fell silent looking at the girl sitting next to Yu as she boldly called out 6 million oh VIP guest number 30 bids 6 million is there anyone willing to bid higher he blinked in surprise and turned to look the host voice urges everyone hoping to increase the price even further but no one bids higher congratulations to VIP guest number 30 for acquiring this item seeing y wo intently gazing at the item he just bit on the girl smiled as if she had realized something it seems this guest is quite fond of this item isn't he she turned to strike up a conversation let me tell you life can't be predicted being too rational is not always good this I give to you surprised that a woman he just met would want to gift such a valuable item to him Yi wo felt quite hesitant however due to his excitement and desire to own the sucan cloak he was considering accepting it but it seemed the system had sensed something and spoke up be careful this person has a dark purple Spectrum she is trying to scheme against you after during the systems warning y Wu pushed the gift back toward the girl thank you for your concern you but I can't accept it youve already helped me a lot today I don't want to owe you too much if it's okay please keep it one day when I have the money I'll buy it for 8 million the girl sitting next to ywo felt a little disappointed and shy after hearing that showing interest she said all right I didn't expect to gain an additional 2 million haha he really isn't simple I was going give a gift to make him owe me and then get him to join the team it's really not that simple after she thought this the host immediately announced the next auction item the next item is one of Great Value moreover it will definitely be an essential personal item for many people it is the Epic engineering drawings y Wu exclaimed in Surprise epic item that's right the host explained it is the engineering drawings artifact the Iron Heart its attribute is to use the capabilities of the item to create a permanent Warrior who will obey your commands it can transform and up up grade the initial level is level 10 and the initial gender is neutral the host then shouted loudly the engineering drawings have a starting price of 2 million some people were surprised to hear this 2 million did I hear that wrong a rare Master engineering drawing is already 8 million the whole Hall was in an uproar it must be because the usage level requirement is too high worried it won't sell no way they were discussing to become a master engineer ER is incredibly challenging only the top major corporations are willing to invest resources and money to acquire one however small companies find it very difficult to utilize them in the world there are no more than 10 people who have become Master Engineers upon hearing their conversation he realized the value of his title no more than 10 people I had no idea that becoming a master engineer was so rare I Vis had a proud expression of course it not only requires Financial Resources but you also need talent that surpasses the ordinary even the previous owner despite having this title found it very challenging to obtain the master engineer designation he sighed at this my luck it really is that tough huh then I need to thoroughly understand my own abilities saiou said to him I don't think anyone will buy this he was a bit confused why not it's so cheap she explained although this blueprint can be upgraded and has tremendous potential it is very difficult to utilize moreover even if you are a master engineer creating the blueprint will also consume a lot of intelligence attributes therefore it is very hard for anyone to buy this blueprint hearing that he Chu sinisterly what are you afraid of what's more important is that if no one buys it it will be easier for me to get it and I have a system to help after all as expected SAU anticipated his next words 2 million how could no one buy it then when nobody made an offer the host intended to declare it as passed however he raised his hand wait wait a second VIP guest number 30 bids 2 million I thought no one would buy it yet everyone seeing him raise his hand the audience began to mock ha is someone really buying it haha do you think you are a construction master stupid saou thought he wanted to make money and intervened hey hey what are you going to do with this this thing can only be used by construction Masters even if you want to buy it to resell you won't be able to sell it he acted mysteriously no need to worry I have my own reasons for buying it at this moment he was so ecstatic he could almost go crazy he wonderful how could these people here possibly know the true value of it but for me this item is definitely five stars the host announced congratulations to VIP guest number 30 for acquiring the item at the original price of 2 million the system notification rang out a sum of 2 million has been deducted you have obtained the item engineering drawings he secretly rejoiced this comes at just the right time in addition to enhancing my Firepower it can also help protect my dad mom and little sister the Airing of Lucky special effects has been activated the engineering drawings will be upgraded he was so excited he felt like crying good The Joy doubles after leveling up the engineering drawings had a new attribute use the drawings to permanently create a humanoid Warrior who will always be loyal to its master and can be modified and upgraded requires a master in engineering from Level 10 to level 20 neutral gender he thought can it be adjusted directly from Level 10 to level 20 then dealing with monsters at levels like ghosts and spiders won't be a problem I Vis beside and winked Master did you forget level is not the most important its gender can change then I viz reflected images of several sexym made outfits into VI mind master what do you want me to do for you you know what needs to be done right he was astonished I can hardly believe this artificial intelligence is such a lecherous being he raised his fist teaching ad v a lesson this trip has truly exceeded my expectations I wonder if the remaining six items are even more special soon after the fifth item also appeared dragon skin battles shield shield attribute it has the effect of Defense reducing 30% of the damage received by the user starting price is 7 million the sixth item is the dragon tooth blood blade dagger attribute when dealing damage to the enemy the damage inflicted on the enemy will convert to 20% of the user's Health the trading price is 10 million just as the seventh item was about to be revealed the host finally introduced it the seventh item will be disclosed now it is the summon Beast demon Crystal a super rare level item the starting price is 10 million with each raise not less than 1 million after using the summoned Beast demon Crystal magical power is replenished the magical creatures within the crystal can be activated to fight until the magical power is exhausted everyone in the hall began to bid here I bid 11 million I bid 15 million he said this is the first time I've heard of this saiou explained after defeating the boss there is a low chance of getting a magic Crystal from the boss this magic crystal is considered rare it's understandable if you don't know saiou took this opportunity to seduce him in this world there are countless things you do not know and you cannot touch them at your current level but if you are interested in these secrets then just join the Mong team he thought to himself to convince me to join it seems she has put in quite effort perhaps in her eyes I am just like a frog sitting at the bottom of a well but little does she know I'm not stuck with My Own Strength I can escape the well and see the vast Blue Sky the host finally announced the item sold for 50 million congratulations to the buyer I viz sarcastically said even if you wanted to you wouldn't have enough money to buy such items at this moment would you he was struck by her words and threatened shut up don't make me angry at that moment the host jumped down from the stage next I might need to make way for it as this item is quite large after the smoke dissipated what appeared before everyone was a large tank let me introduce to you the 2000m caliber magnetic rail Canon the electromagnetic Siege Chariot this electromagnetic siege tank uses magical electromagnetic energy to fire an electromagnetic wave with immense destructive power the entire Auditorium erupted I never expected this auction to include Siege tanks this is definitely going to fall into the hands of large corporations most likely the Dungeon Siege is a battle consisting of 50 to 100 people aren't high-end corporations the perfect fit he secretly marveled The Dungeon Siege today is truly an eyeopener with a plethora of fascinating information this is only the eighth item and it's already like this what other surprises will the remaining items hold truly something to look forward to the next item level 40 siege tank this vehicle can destroy everything even at levels 40 to 60 but what's important is its output is very stable this is not a bad choice for exploration teams and sieges its starting price is 20 million with a minimum bid increment of 2 million now show me your bidding hands as soon as the judge has finished speaking a flurry of hands shot up loudly shouting 22 million 28 million 30 million Yu stood next to SAU murmuring the price is indeed too high just for use in the Dungeon Siege and exploration it's really unnecessary and the Dungeon Siege sounds truly magnificent saou explained the Dungeon Siege is one of the most special replica battle formations besides that there are Tower Defense Wars escape and kill and biochemical Warfare only the top teams are strong enough to launch attacks and capture the dungeons the judge announced a closing deal congratulations to the VIP customer who has won it for 88 million next is the ninth item the high Lev dungeon key level 100 starting at a price of 30 million the judge provided a brief introduction this is a mysterious key that can lead the owner to mystical places within the legendary dungeon everyone was astonished this is the highlevel dungeon key level 100 since entering here I have never seen a highlevel dungeon key one person remarked with the resources this dungeon provides it must be worth at least 50 million ye woo question its value reaches up to 50 million then why are so few people wanting to buy it saou smiled and explained because dungeon keys all come with a usage limit when you start using it the countdown begins if the usage level drops to zero you will no longer be able to enter using it multiple times will reduce the remaining uses so mostly only only the top teams dare to buy it as they are capable of completing the dungeon quickly as soon as Hau finished speaking Yu exclaimed in Surprise what there's that too then my level 40 Dungeon key he immediately called the system requesting an analysis of the level 40 Dungeon key after a successful analysis the system presented new information level 40 Dungeon key requires usage when reaching levels 40 to 50 coordinates area c87 outside the safe Zone type and introduction unknown durability 80% y Wu thought to himself as expected durability has been added the key is already showing signs of rust a key is necessary to enter the dungeon but the important thing is where exactly this area c87 is while he was deep in thought another young man shouted loudly 1.5 million everyone around was astonished 1.5 million that's insane the judge announced this VIP guest has bid 1.5 million is there anyone willing to bid higher of course there was no one and the judge quickly closed the deal Yu stood silently thinking 1.5 million for a dungeon key indeed with money you could buy anything the judge continued to speak drawing everyone's attention ladies and Gentlemen please don't take your eyes off the stage the final item which is also the most valuable item in this auction is the the resurrection potion of Fury the starting price is 1 million he gave a brief introduction the resurrection potion of Fury is a legendary item that contains mysterious Powers capable of bringing a person back to life hearing this the entire Hall was taken a back and cries rang out a potion that brings a person back to life how can anyone jolt like that does this kind of potion really exist even if I have to sell my house I must have this vial of potion SAU was also stunned muttering damn I can't believe there is such an item but I don't have enough money to buy it y Wu quickly turned to ask the system can we craft this Resurrection potion ourselves the system replied no the resurrection potion is a forbidden item capable of disrupting the rules of this world the judge continued to explain as you all know when the world entered the O era all Resurrection skills became taboo even the highest ranking priests cannot control or fully understand this type of skill if someone uses the resurrection potion of Fury they can come back to life but it comes at a great cost they will turn into a monster and fall into a state of murderous frenzy a young man responded turning into a monster is no different than being dead the judge interjected everyone please continue listening this state of frenzy will only last for a month after a month the user will return to normal the crowd in in the hall upon hearing this became enthusiastic about finalizing their orders oh I see then it's worth it for me to have it one person bid 1.5 million yiwu silently assessed indeed life is important even with money if it cannot be used it is as good as wasted but what exactly is this frenzy drug this is the first time I've heard of it are there indeed various other races existing in this world nearly all information about it is shra it in mystery another wealthy person upon hearing the bid raised his hand 3 million someone else chimed in 3.3 million the judge announced the VIP guest has bid 3 million is there anyone willing to bid higher Yu was also surprised to hear the wealthy person bid 3 million how does this senior have so much money it's quite suspicious is there something Shady going on here I'd better keep my distance to avoid any unforeseen circumstances the judge finalized congratulations to the VIP guest for acquiring the item at the price of 3 million the judge concluded thus today's auction comes to an end see you all next time wishing everyone a good day youu looked around telling himself this place is truly wonderful next time I must earn more money that's right seeing his younger sister he called out Yun Fay have you finished buying your gear yet aren't you afraid of keeping Mom and Dad waiting too long yanf replied loudly why are you back so early wait a moment let me finish choosing y Wu felt helpless towards his sister and turned to talk to saou thank you this trip has indeed brought me a lot of gains saou smiled and said don't thank me yet what you saw today is just the tip of the iceberg if you join the Mong team you'll learn much more Yu responded calmly thank you I will consider that then he turned to yanf hurry up I'll give you half an hour I'm going to buy some things when I come back it better be done all right yanf answered understood standing beside Yi Wu thought to himself exploring this world is indeed very difficult and more importantly I have to protect my family I cannot entrust that important task to Outsiders even to large corporations it's best to rely on My Own Strength thus he pondered the research project is truly reasonable the necessary items are easy to acquire costing only 4 million on the black market so it's time to start crafting 3 days later in the auditorium of the academy the school's bell rang all the students had gathered everyone was anxious and waiting to hear information about the recent terrorist attack at their Academy the principal stood on the podium and spoke loudly after 3 days the students must have calmed down a bit he glanced at the students in the Institute after receiving their notd he felt reassured and continued as we all know 3 days ago our school experienced a terrorist attack aimed at the young lady of the handm mo group Moi n this was a highlevel terrorist attack carefully planned and the security level of our Institute was insufficient to defend against it he clenched his fists and continued everyone knows that if young lady moai had actually encountered trouble in our Institute our school would have been finished the principal's attitude clearly reflected the serious Ness of the situation he spoke earnestly to all the students as the principal I felt utterly desperate at that moment but at that crucial time the appearance of one person not only saved young lady moai but also pulled our Institute back from the brink of Despair the students seemed to hold their breath silently and anxiously waiting for each of his words then the entire School erupted in joy and began to speculate about the person who had saved them a person so powerful that they could confront an army at level 15 while the enemy leader was nearly level 50 how did that person manage to do it a male student analyzed that must be a member of the Mong team only a person of such caliber could have accomplished something like that another male student spoke up to refute I heard it was a student who did some people nearby heard and burst out laughing a student we're all HBL over trembling on the ground who would dare to stand up and resist the principal smiled suggested everyone keep quiet and then said surely over the past few days everyone has heard some rumors right indeed we have been aided by a fellow student so next the principal pointed at Yu with a proud expression and loudly proclaimed let's give the warmest Applause to welcome the savior of our Academy student y wo please come up to the stage to receive the award ywu slowly walked up standing next to the principal under the astonished gazes of everyone the entire Academy Buzz with conversation what it's really y wo many people looked at him enviously while others snickered it's y woo the one who can't level up what a joke another male student boldly declared if it's really him then I'll do a handstand in the shape of an S another chimed in me too but I don't even know how to do a handstand others suspected something was fishy about this story and asked the principal the identity of the savior is kept a secret but why use y wo to trick us the male student wearing glasses with brown unkempt hair was raising his voice in displeasure to hide the real Sager the principal has pushed all the credit on to guwu if he really needs a replacement why not choose me I'm far better than that trash Yu in every respect suddenly he was unexpectedly grabbed by his collar and lifted up by L Fang who often accompanied yiu hey try saying that again he furiously shabed how could a worthless insect like you have doubts while the boss is fighting a powerful enemy and your pants are still dripping wet his face turned pale with fear raising his hands in surrender not daring to speak further a you the majority of the other male students still looked skeptical could it really be ye wooo did it although the principal said so it's hard to believe whoever Saves The Academy is fine it's just for the sake of a reward a compliment and a few steps on stage ruin tyen tyan felt indignant for yiu at the doubts of everyone she thought to herself it's Yu who saved everyone why don't they believe it he's so strong and handsome zi standing aside was both observing the situation while thinking is it really ywo the principal angrily shouted causing the entire Academy to fall silent you all don't believe what I said ywo smiled standing next to the principal hands in his pockets and casually said no need to worry about it principle after all people only believe in what they see with their own eyes for things they do not understand it is a normal reaction whether they believe it or not doesn't matter please do not delay the award presentation because of Such trivial matters the principal nodded in agreement and then solemnly announced in front of all the teachers and students I will give you 101 points the extra point is to encourage you to keep striving seeing the principal's decisive praise those who were doubtful felt more assured at this level it can't be a pretense everyone exclaimed in unison let's give a big round of applause to celebrate yes yes yes we believe that ywu is the savior but some people were only applauding verbally I really want to learn from the principal suddenly the students pointed fingers at themselves unable to Bear the provocation and the principal became Furious he quickly Justified the verbal reward Although our KN Academy does not have as much money as other acad iies I will certainly not be stingy towards those who have made outstanding contributions to the academy he unexpectedly presented a pile of cash to prove that he could say and do it seeing this a few envious individuals couldn't help but exclaim damn it so much cash is all in a reward for youu principal are you really doing this the principal firmly continued this 2 million in cash is just a small part the real reward is the distribution of oldw world ruins everyone below was incredibly astonished what there's even a reward this great Yi Wu truly could not believe his eyes he calmly confirmed once again thinking to himself hey principal this is a treasure of the academy normally you wouldn't even let it be glanced at are you really giving it to me the principal pointed upwards and said although the students are already aware of it today I will clarify it further then he began to explain this precious map originates from the greatest former student in the history of our ninth Academy the legendary Relic Hunter toyway symbolizing our courageous spirit in advancing to explore the unknown The Relic Hunters you must have heard of them they are a powerful group not afraid of death especially in exploring the wild dungeons and oldw World ruins selling the coordinates to large groups at a high price TW way was one of the greatest explorers of the order era on Earth his aim was to restore the order of the world relying on his own efforts he charted a map of the distribution of ruins and wild dungeons within a radius of 2,000 kilometers concentrated around the safe Zone yiu seems to be very interested and knows some information about TWY I've heard about this but ultimately due to being overly Reckless he ventured into an area that no one had ever explored before however the authenticity of the map cannot be verified so it is regarded by everyone as a great Legend the principal continued despite the mockery and Scorn from the crowd only smiled but as an old classmate and someone who has studied under him I have always believed in his courage and spirit of exploration I will never forget the day he handed over the drawing to me and then disappear into the Wilderness beyond the safe Zone The principle's Voice shoped with emotion as he reminisced about the past with twe therefore he quickly regained his composure and declared regardless of whether the contents of this painting are real or fake the one who receives it is y woo he handed the map to ywu gently entrusting it you may only see it as a reward but I'd see it as a legacy with tears in his eyes filled with unwavering belief in yu the principal said in you I sense courage that is why I will pass this precious Legacy to you I hope you can live up to the expectations of everyone and become someone even greater than TW way ye woo held the treasure with great reverence joyfully affirming I will not disappoint you principal don't worry I will not betray your expectations suddenly the building Shook and objects were displaced the ceiling lights fell causing everyone to panic what is happening is it an earthquake as they were about to flee everyone noticed and shouted to each other hey look at the ceiling a dazzling Golden Light immediately caught everyone's attention a rift in space had appeared a large hole suddenly emerged in the ceiling the principal quickly shouted everyone run why are you just standing there all students evacuate to the shelter immediately hurry up faculty above level 15 stay back and form up prepare to attack the enemy Yu was still holding the map in his hand Frozen in place looking up at the ceiling contemplating the warning he had heard before why is this happening could it be that those two were actually right why is it happening now in a crowded area like the school campus annoyingly the lower level students were fleeing in disarray the remaining people gathered to stand firm following the principal directions pay attention to the monster beasts that are appearing the professors stabilize the formation and try to buy time for the students to evacuate the professors shout loudly yes the Beast gradually reveals its true form attacking those present in the academy causing many students to be injured or killed a monster mockingly says buying time to evacuate with me here do you think you can run away the Beast with a pig's head and two large fangs named giant Pigman level 15 one person saw it and shouted level 15 Beast why is it so strong the Beast hearing this angrily Roars level 15 H our tribe of beasts survives in the wild proof fighting to evolve those who have survived until now are the level 15 Elite of this great one you worthless beings cannot compare the Beast filled with energy charges towards a male student who is curled up on the ground he threatens in fear no don't come here my father is a very strong martial artist if you dare to touch a single hair on me he will definitely not forgive you he won't forgive you the weak threats of the male student only excite the monster further is that so then you can help me fill my stomach first you have the flavor that I really like the increasingly desperate screams of the male student echoed the sharp claws of the giant pigmon were about to strike down but suddenly the the monster was hit on the head by a sword losing all its strength the weak cries gradually came to an end seeing himself saved the student joyfully shouted father father is that you yiu walked over from a distance carrying a large sword on his shoulder and coldly said I have no son like you if you want to live hurry and get to the shelter realizing that the person he had previously looked down upon had saved his life the student knelt and grasped the benefactor leg tearfully saying my woo y woo thank you for saving me before I shouldn't have doubted you please protect me in the moment of urgency this fool kept cleaning on Yu turned and shouted loudly don't you understand what I'm saying get lost the male student ran away on all fours yes yes he was terrified by Yu's gaze running while thinking that look definitely wasn't a joke in a second he would surely kill me looking at the monster's corpse lying right in front of him ye W thought if this invasion of the beasts is to take over the nin safe area then it must surely be on a larger scale than this the initial level of the beasts is 15 just like the demon that was here before this indicates that the limit of the spatial riff that can be sustained is level 15 he who paused for a moment the question is what will the highest limit be while concentrating on his thoughts he heard a call from afar Lu Fang holding the grand axe said boss I'm here to help you Ruan tianan followed closely behind telling Yu I'm here to help you too Yu was surprised and said you all before the three of them could come up with a plan to fight the Earth and Sky trembled once again Yu pointed towards the spatial Rift saying the spatial Rift has appeared again it seems like they won't be stopping Yu continue to speculate if I'm not mistaken this wave of beasts will still be at level 15 but with your current levels Lu Fang and Ruan tanan Express surprise what still level 15 Lu Fang suddenly turned and walked away got it boss let's go Ruan tnen we will only be a hindrance to you now Ruan T also understood the intention and along with lu Fang began to retreat Lu Fang continued all we can do is help the professor ERS Evacuate the students to the shelter just as the two were about to turn away they heard the voice of the Red Feather rooster die realizing this was a good opportunity for their friends Yu quickly called the two back I didn't say you could leave Yu said now is the perfect chance for you guys to level up you can't waste it yiu rushed forward with his sword towards the Beast saying I will strike until it has only a bit of Health left you two will be the ones to deliver the finishing blow and gain the experience points Ruan andan quickly replied all right Lu Fang also Stood Beside cheering Ruan tanan so Majestic so bold show them that humans are not to be bullied so easily the Red Feather roster disdainfully said you don't know the meaning of life and death then Yu raised his sword and struck the first blow causing the Beast to Screech ah Ruan tan used basic lightning swiftly taking down the monster seizing the opportunity ye W continued to command follow me don't stop from the auditorium the group Advanced straight into the campus taking turns to slay any beasts they encountered both nodded in unison understanding each other's intentions then the three of them entered the school grounds when they saw a monster attacking the students of the academy the roar echoed die all of you the fellow students Cried Out desperately ah save me a male student still calm said don't run around quickly follow the professor to the shelter the entire Academy was being smashed by the monster Yu looked around and cursed silently damn it the situation is worse than I thought it seemed that the entire night's safety zone had been attacked the conspiracy has become a reality the creature in front of yiu was the devil horn bull it was very pleased with itself want to escape the others becoming my experience points is the best choice I will let you die without pain ye will refuse to give up rushing straight to fight the monster making a path for Lu Fang shut up I don't have time to talk to trash like you he was a bit worried about yanf secretly thinking even though I told my sister to stay home with our parents and Nana and not to come to school this morning I'm still a bit worried then he signaled to Lu fanglu Fang finish it luu Fang immediately agreed okay boss then he commanded the system system contact Yun Fe the system quickly activated connecting please wait Lu Fang Unleashed a lethal blow shouting die beef with bra pork the devil horn bll bellowed in pain gr Yi Wu carried his sword Landing safely but his heart was always worried about his sister no matter how worried he was he could not abandon the professors and students I need to contact Yun first to see how things are over there then I can figure out the next steps however the system displayed a message the other party is busy or the signal is distorted unable to connect to yay Yun Fe Yi Wu was both frustrated and anxious because he could not reach his sister damn it why can't I contact yanf is it possible she is in danger suddenly a scream echoed a it turned out to be the wild wolf beast asserting its dominance weak humans even though we are both level 15 you are no match for me do you know how many of my kind I had to kill to reach level 15 useless humans teacher Chen was left with only 20% Health being Trampled Under the beast's feet even in the face of danger teacher Chen would not bow down do not equate our Humanity with that of wild beasts who kill each other like you do if you wish to touch my students you must first step Over My Dead Body he shielded his bloody body in front of the students though he was exhausted he still bravely defended them causing every student to be touched and call out his name teacher Chan but while wolf jumped High excitedly saying I will fulfill your wish and slowly Savor the delicacy of human blood and flesh teacher chin with just a little strength left continued to block the Monstrous Beast path giving his students more time to escape you all hurry and run as the wild wolf was about to swing its hand to kill the stubborn opponent in front of it it ly let out a wretched cry who is it the monster was unexpectedly attacked by a lethal stab to its chest causing it to collapse with only 1% of its Health remaining ye woas no crying alow teacher Chen managed to escape with his life crawling toward his students but still unaware of who his benefactor was you you are a male student quickly shook the professor hard beside him Yu had yet to come to his senses when the group was hurried along by him teacher chin please quickly take the other students away from here I will help you bandage the wounds recognizing it was indeed y woo teacher Chan felt deeply grateful it really is y wo no wonder he is the savior of the academy he nodded and smiled at the praise from his classmate thank you ye woo while those beasts haven't refreshed yet we need to quickly run to the underground shelter however in Yu's heart he still felt very anxious he thought to himself right now worrying about my parents at home is useless I can only trust Nana to keep them safe I must use all my strength to deal with the beasts in the academy and then quickly return home in another area of the academy a cyclops also appeared at level 15 it said so this is the school of humanity it seems the idea of using a few low-level survivors to offer as sacrifices to the captain is indeed a correct thought I've heard that this school has many lowle humans and it was quite a challenge to finally be assigned to this area it stretched out its long tongue a gleeful eye continued I must have a really hearty meal while sightseeing and gathering information they heard Yu say it's your turn Lu Fang looked at the monster in front of him confident and contemptuous oh there's no way this is possible such a puny and weak human dares to stab me Lu Fang raised the axe high from behind the monster and said if I stab you what will happen that's what I'm best at the monster panicked pleading spare my life please I haven't killed a single human yet I just came back from a crack in space please don't Lu Fang ignored those pleas determined to take down the Beast he delivered a finishing blow right to its head if you want to come then come if you want to leave then leave do you think this is your home go die trash the monster roared in pain with ye help Lu Fang finally leveled up haha I have finally reached level 15 following the boss to kill monsters to level up is indeed fast Ru and tyen tan was equally excited that's right that's right even I have reached level 12 now all thanks to Yu for taking us training she was happily caught off guard by Lu Fang Ruan T you are not allowed to call the boss by his full name to avoid an argument between the two yiu quickly spoke up to mind them and raised his vigilance we shouldn't pay attention to trivial matters like this especially not get lost in pleasure after leveling up he frowned and looked back continuing including the one just now we have killed 20 beasts moreover all of them are at level 15 this is absolutely not normal the Beast Invasion at level cannot be limited to level 15 as predicted from the cosmic Rift appeared a beast at level 16 it was the bone sword tiger if it roared on Yu quickly analyze the level of the beasts had indeed increased like that there were two possibilities but before he finished analyzing the bone sword tiger charged at the three of them yigu shouted it's too fast the bone sword tiger arrogantly said that's only natural you humans absolutely cannot keep up with my speed seeing the Beast rushing towards Ruan tan y Wu yelled be careful Ruan tion its Target is you tyen Tien was a bit panicked but quickly regained her composure what don't underestimate me I am not the helpless chicken that can be slaughtered anymore with the Magic Shield she received High Praise from ywo not bad reaction speed Ruan tntn you have finally learned to protect yourself after that Yi Wu attacked let me strike first and you will deliver the final blow she agreed and the monster was quickly defeated however Yu still could not get in touch with yanf he reassured himself the invading beasts range from low to high levels and Nana is at level 20 so father mother and Yan FEI can hold out for a short time and have enough time for me to come help all the teachers and students hid in The Refuge but you Mo wondered what the maximum level for the monsters was level 50 level 60 he hefted his sword to face the giant monster continually thinking in his mind from the the battle with the black tiger teen last time I can cope with level differences within a range of 20 levels but the level Gap this time is too great how can I handle this he told himself right now don't think about these things just focus on the task at hand the invading beasts have been here for half an hour already he swung his sword in a circle then turned away leaving the Fallen Beast behind he continued to think most of the teachers and students probably took refuge in the shelter but one cannot rule out the possibility that there are those who have gotten lost I cannot abandon anyone who is still alive Yi Wu clenched his fists showing a determined attitude he quickly commanded the system used the true eye skill the system quickly sent him a report activating true ey skill scanning for creatures within the academy is complete please review the results Master he looked at each Red Dot on the map and said indeed there are still some classmates and teachers who have gotten lost Yi Wu quickly directed for now we will split into two teams I will head to the farthest part of the academy the supply room to rescue the people yiu said luu Fang and Ruan tyen tyen are going together over at the dining hall there are also three people hiding in there after rescuing them it's convenient to head down to the shelter Underground when luu Fang heard he would be going with Ruan tntn he adamantly opposed huh boss I don't want to go with her I want to go by my myself Ty Tian also refused to back down her expression frowning what do you mean by that I don't want to go with you either Yu raised his voice to correct them huh what did you two just say my hearing isn't good repeat that the two quickly startled trembling as they said and no nothing we'll leave immediately almost laughing at their reaction ye wo carefully instructed L Fang although both of you have leveled up always be cautious and don't take risks coordinating closely with each other is the only way to break the strongness force Lu Fang declared boldly boss leave it to me I'm very confident in my command skills the three split up to carry out their tasks following gwu's words action Ruan Tian tyan looked after him her eyes full of worry loudly saying G woo you remember to pay attention to safety don't worry about us luu Fang continued these demon beasts at this level can't pose a threat to the boss yet Lu Fang proudly commanded tyen let's go Ruan tnan I never expected that one day I would have to work with you seeing Lu Fang's demeanor made her want to tease a bit more before leaving sympathy your blood is in my hands now I'm no longer the rookie I once was Lu Fang looked towards Yi Wu who was gradually Fading Into the distance filled with appreciation I've changed too unbid notes to us the boss has changed us and I believe the boss can still lead us towards a better future Yu filled with courage sprinted straight to the storage room as he ran he thought I still don't know the limits of the demon beasts I can't fight a battle without preparing first he commanded enter the system space he asked how many experience points do I currently have the machine replied according to calculations the current accumulated experience value of the host is too 110,000 the host can unlock a new king account and the host can also choose to upgrade the link level to unlock new talents hearing this y Wu curiously asked is it more than my own prediction because of the black tiger mercenary cor before and also because I just single-handedly killed a demon Beast then he continued but given the current situation there is no time to slowly research a new profession he commanded system use all experience points to upgrade the level of the Chen emperor the system responded order received currently using 20,000 experience points to increase one level congratulations host the linked level of the Chen Emperor account is+ 10 the next linked level is 31 a feeling of powerful heat surged intensely within his body yiu exclaimed so strong feels like this power is overflowing throughout my body so wonderful is this the effect of increasing level by 10 at once yiu stats board had leveled up to five he said my own level has increased by another rank but this external control panel is not important as there are many people in this world who can change the levels of the external control panels the systems voice continued to sound host has one star Talent point to allocate please choose the talents to upgrade hearing this ye W thought talents although the previous defense Talent is currently at level 20 it can still withstand an attack from level 40 however it's still suffers from the attack's damage therefore this time he decided to upgrade the attack Talent the system responded commanded attack Talent upgraded the additional special skills of the attack Talent have been unlocked chaien formed first order after gaining energy transform into the first order form of chaien Emperor each attack is a critical hit and the duration is 180 seconds hearing this ye Wu questioned red flame form isn't this the first trans Information Form I had when I first obtained the K account system the system clarified that's correct but at that time the host connection level was too low and the host attributes could not withstand the red flame form so the system automatically locked this skill yiu excitedly said now that my level has increased this skill has been unlocked that's great system convert to a attack Talent he then accelerated rapidly leaving a cloud of dust behind and said I want to get there as quickly as possible in the classroom where teacher Gia and the students were taking shelter he reassured the students it will be fine to high gear the demon beasts damn it compared to my level even cough cough don't worry everyone just stayed behind me a frightened little girl tightly hugged teacher lie teacher I'm so scared the teacher embraced the student and comforted her don't be afraid teacher Jia is here he will protect us teacher Jia continued that's right that's right with me here everyone will be safe however before he could finish his sentence the classroom was engulfed in flames bits of desks and chairs flew everywhere accompanied by the Frantic screams of everyone wa the sound echoed throughout the room creating a chaotic atmosphere teacher J angrily shouted damn it it's so dark I just mentioned the demon beasts however the painful horse face that had just appeared was riddled with six holes in its body reduced to a corpse teacher J shouted no this demon Beast is already dead killed he asked in Surprise who did this so ruthless this is an 18 level demon Beast y wo appeared surrounded by Flames he thought to himself after transferring my talent the attack is indeed different even close combat is very strong wonderful teacher Li saw y Wu appear and hurriedly asked student y Woo is it really you you've saved us once again thank you y wo was surrounded by everyone scratching his head awkwardly and replied teacher there's no need to be courteous I've cleared away the demon beasts outside so everyone should head to the shelter the students were delighted to hear this really that means we are safe now then he continued to advise just on the way please drop by the office building a bit there are still some classmates teacher G hearing this became annoyed with Y woo and shouted if you are so powerful why don't you go by yourself do you want us to go to our Deets furthermore how dare a student like you give orders to your teachers hearing such outrageous words teacher lie was shocked and retorted at teacher J how can teacher Gia say that it's the duty of a teacher to protect their students how can we just sit by and watch someone die teacher Gia fell silent I teacher Li continued moreover Yu's abilities are something that everyone knows we should follow her guidance teacher J's face darkened and he thought to himself hemp I originally wanted to be a hero and save the beauty aiming to win this girl's heart but in the end that yeu Stole was Spotlight I regret it to death now they want me to go along and die no way I will not hand over my life to a little boy who hasn't even fully grown up yet thinking this he angrily marched outside saying as he left all right if you want to go and die then go ahead I'm not playing I came to the academy to be a teacher just for a meal otherwise who'd want to be with these little kids there's no way I would go along with you all to die with that he sheld Yu aside however Yu not only stood firm but teacher Gia felt as if his bones had broken his health bar displayed only 20% remaining he panicked what's wrong with my hand in contrast to teacher J teacher lie approached y wo and said student y woo don't mind him leave the students in the office building to me I will never abandon them y Wu waved at teacher lie and replied okay teacher lie in that case I can be a ease to save the others there may not be any more demon beasts appearing around here in a short time but everyone please try your best teacher Li happily raised his hand and said I understand student you woo all the students responded enthus I asically one girl said so what Ruan tan said was all true another girl replied to Yu you're really both strong and handsome yiu continued to walk toward the storage room standing in front of the door he couldn't help but exclaim this is the legendary storage room of the school it's said that all the secret treasures from the secret realm have been collected by previous generations of the school and are exclusively used for special characters ordinary students cannot enter he he moved closer to the door and examined it thinking to himself moreover the door has been set with a special seal and it can't be opened by force only the combination of the principal and secretary's keys can open it who is the person I saw here with the eyes of Truth he opened the door still lost in thought who could come here in a time of Crisis like this once inside he was quite surprised the door is indeed not locked could the principal make such a mistake no way he walked in and was overwhelmed by the scene before his eyes this is indeed a treasure that dazzles others I must keep my hands firmly under control suddenly hearing a noise he looked in that direction over there yiu was walking towards it and saw a female student doing something suspicious he cleared his throat and coughed sui was startled by the sound of the cough he leaned against the door and smiled at her saying I didn't expect this student to be so leisurely while everyone else is running for their lives this student still has time to come here looking for Treasure have you found a treasure to your liking suy guardedly replied searching for Treasure what does it have to do with you she summoned her power and threatened if you want to live leave quickly seeing the student like that you will remain calm no wonder she is the famous cold goddess student sui everyone says you're not interested in anything but I don't think that's true it's just that that this storage room isn't a place where normal students should come not eating Yu's words sui created three ice swords aimed at him she questioned are you following me yiu replied following you is just a misunderstanding I only discovered that you were here alone so I rushed to save you it seems that this matter is no longer necessary she countered discovered my movements are very secretive how did you find me just before the tip of the sword pierced straight into Yu's face it was suddenly blocked he said of course I have my own ways everyone has their secrets so why be so curious just like the secret of yours that I uncovered which embarrassed you it's my fault after saying that he turned his back to Bid Farewell then I won't disturb you any longer please continue I remind you that the level of the demon beasts outside is rising increasingly don't let your tail show zi seeing his actions exclaimed in confusion stop you just then a loud roar resounded a level 30 raffle gorilla appeared smashing through the wall what he soared into the air to evade while yiu quickly reacted to dodge the Deb yiu thought to himself a newborn demon Beast already at level 30 damn it faster than I had anticipated the wrathful gorilla standing beforei said I can smell the scent of a human woman I never expected to encounter a superb stunner it is has been so long since I had the taste of a human woman today I must enjoy it to the fullest exu he could not endure the humiliation she quickly made her move she replied to the demon Beast mouthful of foul language die as soon as she finished speaking the ice swords she created flew towards the monster but it was unharmed the wrathful gorilla then spoke mockingly Miss why are you in such a hurry but your attack isn't it just massaging me it's it's a Pity that my time is limited otherwise I would really want to play with you some more with that the raffle gorilla swung its hand down to strike soon de intended to dodge but the giant hand of the wrathful gorilla quickly caught her saying don't run after that the wrathful gorilla grasped her enclosing her within a shield and continued you've thought that just bringing the corpse would stop me from devouring what's inside capturing corpses is my specialty sui was trapped in the monster 's hand being squeezed painfully cried out uh her health rapidly decreased to 35% the monster opened its repugnant mouth ready to swallow her hole the wrathful gorilla laughed heartily just suitable as an appetizer haha however before the wrathful gorilla's tongue could touchi it was severed By Flame yiu spoke up you can't defeat this gorilla your predecessors are all pitying and cherishing Jade but it wants to kill you immediately the blood of the raffle gorilla was reduced to only 45% shui therefore began to fall freely Yu flew in to catch her she said wwoo why are you still here that last blow was he didn't wait for her to finish and said the routine operation no need to panic facing a strong enemy running away is not my style moreover I'm here to save people not to get beaten suie blushed with worry but it's level 30 you before she could finish her sentence Yi Wu placed a finger on her lips signaling her to be quiet save your strength don't worry about me this guy is not that scary leave it to me hurry and go the raffle gorilla held its bleeding mouth roaring in Anger cough my tongue how can a level five worthless being have such power how is it possible sui crossed her arms also puzzled could it be that you have concealed your level ye w raised a hand to his mouth to Signal silence then replied it doesn't matter didn't I say everyone has secrets you go on just ignore me the raffle gorilla was infuriated swiftly charging at him with a furious fist damn it I'm near suffering and you two are just standing there making googly eyes at each other go guy ye wo blocked the attack and retaliated he disdainfully said as a demon Beast how can you utter those four words that are flirtatious do you have knowledge of human society as a result of an IQ mutation or has someone taught you it wouldn't be that the so-called great Beast taught you would it upon hearing this the monster was utterly shocked exclaiming what at the same time the system notification sounded congratulations host has gained 3,000 experience points and obtained a level 30 magic item yiu propped his chin and pondered only 5,000 experience points it's even less than I imagined it seems that to increase the level of the connection I can only gain more abundant experience points by defeating higher level opponents on the other hand sui lamented in her heart to think that he could kill a level 30 demon Beast with just two skills how much power is he actually hiding Yu looked at her and said you should quickly go down below to avoid danger the level of demon beasts is steadily increasing who knows what level they will be next time it's too dangerous out side suie replied no me I have my own means of Escape it's just a bit of a Pity that I couldn't pay attention to you earlier otherwise as soon as she finished peeking her body vanished into the snow the next 3 years will probably be very different hope to meet again Yu said this and she completely disappeared Yu didn't understand and began to wonder what's the regret what did she mean I can't grasp it forget it I'll just let her be there's something more important to deal with which is he raised his hands helplessly looking at the pile of props what should I do with this pile of props I can't stand leaving them lying around like this yumu pretended to be sincere clasping his hands together with sparkling eyes said how about I keep them for the principal to avoid losing them I'll return them later let's do it this way after that he picked up a lot of props grabbing a mirror of Truth a seven Hydra a faceless gem an Odin robe a seven stars and eight diagrams plate a royal emblem Yi Wu swept through everything satisfied he said done he opened the map and took a look now all the classmates and teachers were in the shelter then I'll just return however the system's warning notification rang out warning a highlevel elite monster is quickly approaching the shelter y Wu exclaimed as a level 45 Elite monster could it be that a boss has appeared in the safe area the underground shelter had a safety level of 40 the condition for entry required no special privileges the principal's voice rang out everyone don't worry please listen to me this shelter is very sturdy capable of withstanding attacks from Elite demon beasts of level 40 we just need to hold on until reinforcements arrive however the students were still panicked and worried a male student raised his hand and said but principal why is the safety level of this shelter only 40 another student chimed in exactly it can't be higher in the event that a monster above level 40 attacks the principal quickly responded of course there is a reason the demon beasts that attacked our Knight's safe Zone in the past only reached level 30 after that combined with the economic capability of the academy the final Construction level of the shelter was achieved at level 40 even with a safety level of 40 at that time it consumed all the resources of the academy and it took 40 magic crystals to successfully create it the students upon hearing this were also less worried so it turns out level 40 is safe enough in the end they could finally breathe a sigh of relief luu Fang and Ruan tyen tyan were in the corner Tian tyan hugged her legs sitting on the ground anxiously saying why hasn't y wo arrived yet what if something unexpected happens before she could finish her sentence she was interrupted by L Fang shut up how could the boss encounter any problems you should be worried about whether those demon beasts can be knocked Away by the boss or not even so she still said worriedly I know ywu is very strong but I still can't help but worry about him suddenly the door of the shelter was struck making a loud banging sound that left everyone in a panic what is that sound a male student holding his head asked in a panic what is that sound is it a demon Beast chasing us another male student next to him scared said what are you panicking for as long as it's not a level 40 demon Beast we don't need to be afraid luang ran towards the door saying could it be that the boss has arrived open the door quickly the principal unexpectedly spoke up L Fang what do you want to do teacher lie wanted to stop him but couldn't so he had to say wait a moment classmate Lu Fang however waiting for him was not Yu but some something that had burst through the door leaving Lu Fang extremely surprised what is this the door shattered the students were thrown aside the situation was incredibly chaotic ah the door the door is broken how can this be L Fang stood in front of the monster trembling the safety zone has been breached Source shiden the giant level 45 monster that completely blocked the hatch's door spoke with Amusement haha I thought only our race like to dig caves but it turns out that you humans like it too the giant Source chitan continued hiding here saves me a lot of effort in Catching people everywhere to catch them all at once's best I really hate trouble hauh Lu Fang looked up at it confused thinking why is there a level 45 demon Beast No it should be said that there wouldn't be demon beasts above level 30 right what in such an underground space no one can escape what should I do Lu Fang small in stature had attracted the attention of source Shen oh facing my pressure yet you don't back down do you want to die that badly the students in a state of chaos ran around screaming level 45 demon Beast is attacking here we're definitely dead help who will save me facing a life and death situation Lu Fang furrowed his brows and thought boss it seems I am increasingly influenced by you even when facing a powerful enemy I still have the courage to step forward even if this courage may lead to my death with that thought he charged at the monster shouting loudly but who cares the mission you usted to me I will see it through to the end saying that Lu Fang raised his shield and pushed forward toward the monster yelling help as long as I can save one person I will do my utmost to help the monster swatted Lu Fang aside what a nuisance get lost don't delay your interfer in my meal is the thing I hate most about humans like you L Fang took a hit directly and his health immediately dropped to 8% teacher lie worriedly shouted L Fang the monster began to unleash its technique I don't even like eating living people like this it's really problematic wait until your insides are shattered and I can absorb them then it's ground up ah all the students trapped in the purple poison felt as if their blood was being drained from their bodies experiencing hemis screams echoed a my head feels like it's going to split I can't take it anymore someone please kill me I beg you the brave principal made a courageous decision to sacrifice himself in front of the monster hoping to block it silently thinking in his heart farewell my students the student screamed principal don't ah however a bright light like fire appeared taking the principal away the monster angrily exclaimed who who is causing trouble for me y Wu gently supported the principal placing him down on the ground teacher lie was taken by surprise ye classmate y woo the surrounding students also chimed in V woo finally you've arrived hurry principal he y Wu replied to be honest I'm sorry principal I arrived late he gritted his teeth pained and said from now on leave it to me I'll take this bug thousands the corpses Flames Blaze fiercely as if raging surrounding him and forming a solid armor red flame form tier one has been activated the system announc special talent attack skill red flame form tier one has been activated the three minute countdown Begins the monster lamented you are very strong but I'm too lazy to fight with you just come here it would be too wasteful not to gain some benefits so can you all handle this if it's an old classmate can you kill without Mercy each student was controlled by the monster their minds no longer clear screaming in fear I'm not ready to die yet I'm still a male I have to break free I let my classmate Ean my password for drive a is Lou approached Yu thinking before confirming the condition of my classmates I cannot rush to attack the system notification rang out the coold down time for red flame form has ended the skill red flame form has been enhanced it allows the observation of all target statuses immediate activation is recommended Yu commanded it's time to activate red flame form the statuses of everyone appeared and the male student screamed ah

name is Han my My Level 10 status dead height 159 CM wealth 150 L singing secret talking with classmates before the exam hasn't opened a book all day experience value 240 y Wu exclaimed upon witnessing the scene before him is this the enhanced eye of reality the amount of information is staggering after confirming affirming that everyone was dead he decided to take action the screams rang out in his heart Yu silently vowed rest in peace this Grudge I will definitely avenge everyone the monster seeing the situation sneered and mocked you are truly a ruthless one attacking your own kind without even blinking if I can't kill you then I'll kill your kind ha the controlled individuals like zombies charged at Yu's friends turning the situation into chaos the cries of Despair at code ah no don't come here the living and the dead were mixed up creating a horrific scene help me the difficult situation weighed heavily on Yu he expressed his frustration damn it his classmates both the living and the dead were in turmoil there was no way to distinguish clearly the monster laughed gleefully as it saw ye Wu trapped in a predicament derisively saying did you not want to save people then go ahead and save enough can you save all of them ha at that moment Lu Fang appeared rescuing the classmates being attacked he reassured Yu leave this side to us boss you focus on dealing with that monster Ruan T and tan agreed that's right we can only deal with the elementary flame reluctantly Ty tyen took action and those caught in the Flames screamed in pain amidst the chaotic scene a blinding golden block suddenly appeared is this the special effect of the mirror of truth but the mirror of Truth only has the function of separating space yet now it has turned into a space- type Shield Yu then instructed luu Fang and Ruan tnen among the transformed students there are still some survivors don't harm them follow my signals to avoid causing injury both replied understood ye who thought although the mirror of truth and the shield grenade provide very good protection purely defending is still passive we must deal with that monster before the transformation time Runs Out Yu's transformation time was only halfway through the monster sensing something was wrong spread its wings to prepare to flee murmuring just run fast I'm not afraid of him I just don't want to deal with the trouble and hassle but y Wu wouldn't let the monster escape and commanded load the ammunition suddenly a turret appeared out of nowhere firing relentlessly and catching the monster off guard what when was this turret placed moreover the Firepower is this strong before long you would had Chase close behind he gritted his teeth and said you think escaping is that easy dream on y Wu tightly held onto the wings of the monster it screamed in panic let me go you you let go of me Yi Wu decisively broke its wings these obstructive Wings should have been cut off long ago the monster cried out in pain g g i was wrong spare my life I will never do it again information about the monster appeared race Zerg level 48 Elite weaknesses Wings armor piercing fire experience value 200,000 skill violent increases all attributes after mutation Extinction triple slash attack continuously inflicts high damage the third slash is a Critical Strike fatal gastric acid inflicts violent poison status with every attack causing Health reduction each second current status violent mutation y Wu responded to the monsters plea never do it again only a ghost would believe you he kicked it in the stomach causing it to scream in agony ah ah the monster's Health dropped to 35% the system announced interrupted the violent mutation skill of the target the monster mumbled suspiciously this little boy is interrupting my mutation no way it must be just a coincidence it yelled defiantly don't provoke me at most I'll risk my life against you fish die Nets break Yu sneered responding come on then let's see who is the fish and who is the net he dodged the monster's attack then Unleashed a barriage of fierce fire bullets and the system notification appeared interrupted the violence mutation skill of the target the monster was Furious damn it this is definitely not a coincidence s this little boy is intentionally ruining my skill but how does he know what I'm thinking this type of artillery is only used in large scale massacres only mutations and critical strikes are suitable for oneon-one combat then it decided to destroy the turrets thinking to itself never mind first try to escape to a safe place to buy time then wait for a chance to mutate but as it turned to run it realized it had been blocked by a blazing wall of fire the monster swore in despair damn it yiu smiled coldly stepping closer don't be in such a rush this is my final move I will kill you quickly I won't make you waste too much time at the same time the notification system rang out the time to transform into red flame form one tier is insufficient only 10 seconds remaining y Wu grasped the hilt of his sword preparing to unleash his move Crimson star in the red flame form y wuon a blazing red armor he forcefully drove the bright sword into the ground shouting loudly a powerful surge of energy erupted causing the ground to crack and shatter into numerous pieces the monster witnessing the terrifying strength exclaimed in astonishment this is a mental illusion attack no no I remember now this is the legendary dimensional Rift said to be triggered only by the powerful moves of the king that can create this kind of spatial chaos looking down down at Yu with curiosity the monster asked how can a tiny human like you wield such a technique who exactly are you y Wu calmly replied his eyes blazing I am just an ordinary human student yiwu raised his hand and a glowing orb immediately appeared in the space he looked directly into the Monster's eyes his voice filled with fire you better take care of yourself a lowly creature like you has probably never even seen the Starry Sky in your life now I give you a chance to look up once again the monster was astonished By the Light emanating from the brilliant circle on Yu's hand mumbling the death Omen star belongs only to you yiu shouted the essence of deep Mastery the circle on his finger grew a level larger and brilliant light enveloped the red sphere within the monster panicked and hurriedly dodged the blinding light fearfully exclaiming Crimson star no that is clearly a ghostly death star the light from the red sphere shoted stray at the monster and a resounding explosion shook the entire space the system displayed a notification Source Chen energy level at 46% all stats at zero the monster has been completely eliminated the system continued to announce achieved nuclear explosion skill demon Beast Source chidan has been destroyed host receives 200,000 experience and 30,000 currency the red flame form one tear has dissipated y Wu exited the red flame form looked at the system notification and wondered a AAL just hearing the name sounds very formidable could it be that this time it is the demon Beast Leading The Invasion it's likely at least a level 70 or 80 boss I need to quickly strengthen my power otherwise it will be very difficult to cope Yu's eyes lit up as he saw the treasures drop after defeating the monster he chuckled softly I didn't think this would turn out to be so rewarding let's see what this Elite monster drops the list of items appeared level 50 magic Crystal a glowing red stone strong acid gastric juice a red liquid capable of creating extremely strong acid that weakens the protective function of armor fatty cite in legs a flesh filled limb the outer shell of this species is very soft when cooked with a delicious flavor golden wings the wings of this species that have been damaged but still the best raw material for crafting intracranial resonance a level 50 control skill book that allows the use of language or sound to charm and control enemies yiu placed his hands on his hips and side aside from the skill book there's nothing truly special left it seems my luck isn't that great suddenly the system rang out warning unknown a is very interested in the fatty Chen legs Yu frowned as he looked at the spider-shaped egg that was shaking continuously and said to himself it's the egg of the devil's dragon why has it been unresponsive for so long and now it's interested in this Monster's leg if I combine the two what will I get the egg heard Yu speaking and began to shake even more vigorously showing its excitement even its long tongue darted out drooling with desire yiu stared wide-eyed as the egg used its tongue to grab the leg of the monster and yelled what are you trying to do danand Dan the egg quickly stuffed the leg of the monster into its mouth but because the leg was too long a part of it still stuck out Yu shook his head at this scene muttering under his breath damn it it's still doing things like that after completely swallowing the leg of the monster the egg wobbled gleefully appearing adorable and even licked around its mouth with its tongue the system immediately notified unknown egg feels very satisfied affection value increases by one the host should continue to feed it yiu propped his hands on his knees bending down to take a closer look at the egg so it turns out I need to feed it like raising a pet in the future I'll save any living materials I find for you upon hearing this the egg was overjoyed although it couldn't speak it still tried to make its expression even cuter in front of ywo from behind a voice sounded boss are you okay Yi Wu turned his head and saw ruin tantan rushing over Hing his neck worried just now for a moment I couldn't see you or the elite monster it made me so worried yumu was startled and looked at her gently replying I'm fine don't worry Lu Fang stood with his arms crossed looking at y Wu and Ruan tianan and said with a smile I have told Ruan Tien several times with the boss here there will absolutely be no problem Yu looked at the two of them smiling this time you both worked hard Lu Fang scratched his head feeling shy replied it's nothing if it worked for the boss helping me level up to 15 I would have been killed by the elite monster a long time ago ruin TNN standing beside them had an unreadable expression but the corners of her eyes were filled with tears she said sadly there are still many classmates who encountered misfortunes we are still too weak and we can't do much ywu quickly patted her head gently comforting her this is something unavoidable we are outnumbered if you can keep the cat casualties within a reasonable range that means you have done your best don't be sad Ru tanan lowered her head her voice soft um people gradually gathered around standing beside y wo L Fang and Ruan tantion they comforted Ruan tyen tyan together and expressed their gratitude to ywu one person spoke up if it weren't for both of you there would definitely be more people hurt none of us would have survived another person bow and apologize to Y wo hesitating I'm sorry I previously said unkind things about you I was wrong from today on you are my God everyone unitedly said that's right ye woo from today on my body and spirit both belong to you as long as you don't mind that I am a male in another Corner a group of female students sat with their knees drawn up and arms crossed saying sadly I can't contact my parents either I don't know if they are safe from the demon beasts teacher lie sitting beside them hurriedly reassured you all shouldn't be too pessimistic although the safety level in zone 9 isn't High there are major Enterprises and a security team taking turns they will definitely be able to fend off the demon beasts the male students standing around listen to teacher Li's encouragement all of them blushing and in a days teacher lie continued smiling gently you all must stay strong wait for the rescue and don't get give up hope Yu stood looking at everyone and spoke to reassure them I have cleared the demon beasts from the academy grounds it is very safe here the food in the canteen is enough to supply all of you for a week ruin tanan was the first to believe y Woo's words all right we believe you classmate you woo then everyone noticed the principal lying unconscious on the ground one person worriedly asked is the principal okay teacher lie replied yes he is still alive but he was severely injured when confronting an elite monster right now he is very weak and in a coma we need to treat him quickly otherwise I fear he won't hold on for long y Wu quickly replied teacher lie don't worry I will think of a way his brows furrowed slightly and his entire face became serious in his mind y Wu had outlined a detailed plan four steps ahead step one is to use Mosa's abilities to repair and upgrade the main gate step two is for Lu Fang and Ruan tyen tyan to clear the battlefield gather Loot and especially go to the canteen to get necessary supplies step three is to quickly return home to meet with Yun Fe and my parents while also finding an opportunity to go to the Night Market to get medicinal herbs for the principal step four is to contact the rescue team to update the situation outside the academy after finishing his thoughts Yu said Lou Fang and Ruan tntn what I am about to say you two must listen very carefully both quickly responded got it when arriving at the school gate yiu saw a large pit in the ground within which lay the corpse of a person who had stiffened looking at this scene yigu sighed guessing he was killed before he could Escape truly he brought this upon himself on the information system board it appeared teacher J level 16 all stats are zero y Wu continued walking looking out at the the city engulfed in Smoke And Flames thinking to himself asterisk in this era without strength a human is just like fish and meat for human Slaughter if I want to become a true leader my strength is still not Ino asterisk the sound of ZZ SI rang out and a screen unexpectedly appeared in front of Y Wu along with intermittent sounds z z z brother brother yiu was surprised to look at the screen and hurriedly asked Yun f is it you but all that responded was silence anxiously y wo urgently inquired I'm here where is everyone how are Mom and Dad are they in danger the screen continued to receive unclear short sounds me and Mom and Dad now Z save Z then the call was cut off and a line of text appeared on the screen signal is being interfered with information interrupted Yu Wu stared intently at the screen his Heart full of worry he shouted loudly Yun Fe Yun Fe but all he received was the notification interference signal is increasing strongly information is interrupted angrily Yu roared information interrupted again damn it he quickly ran away praying as he ran Mom and Dad Yuni Nana everyone must hang on wait for me his feet moved quickly and Y Wu looked up to the sky and exclaimed in horror this is impossible the large building in front of them had been devastated the smoke and Flames were still swirling around here proving that a fierce battle had taken place ye who stood in it days looking at the building his heart in disarray my nightmare has come true the family could it be that Yun FEI and the others really he shook his head no it can't be y wo clenched his fists trying to keep himself calm he gritted his teeth thinking to himself if the apartment was really attacked by demon beasts Yuni and them would definitely not just sit and wait for death they would run away it must be like that suddenly he heard A desperate scream from afar help me he immediately looked over and saw a girl being attacked by a demon Beast you scream all you want no matter how much you scream no one will come to save you just obediently become my experience points haha the demon Beast was elated while the girl struggled screaming no please on the system appeared information about the girl kid Ru security Team level 18 Health remaining 15% the demon Beast still excited suddenly got attacked haha a beam of Light Came slicing down from above striking it kin Ru sitting underneath was terrified by the sudden light Yu looked at her and asked by looking at your clothes are you part of the security team responsible for this area kin Ru looked up at him and replied anxiously that's right brother can you help me with something my leg it's pinned under a rock she hadn't even finished speaking when a loud explosion erupted from behind sending debris flying in all directions both of them quickly dodged the flying pieces of bricks headed towards them y Wu anxiously asked do you know what happened to this apartment building what about the residents inside where did they go are they alive please tell me kin Ru hearing his urgent questions quickly replied don't don't be so anxious brother y Wu took a deep breath trying to regain his composure and said I'm sorry I was a bit out of control just now my family is among the crowd being evacuated where will the surviving residents be taken do you know kin Ru stood up holding a large gun looked at him and responded they were taken to the nearest underground bunker number five there are two guard teams there she paused for a moment sat down took out a bottle of medicine and while drinking continued this area was attacked by a level 20 demon Beast fortunately my team fought with all our might in the end most of the residents were rescued and evacuated I was followed by this demon Beast because I stayed behind at the electricity after she took the medicine her health index increased to 70% y Wu breathed the sigh of relief thinking to himself thank goodness if it's only a level 20 demon Beast Yuni and everyone else should be fine after temporarily regaining her strength kin ruse stood up she tightly gripped her gun looked at him seriously and said it's useless anyway our highest ranked Captain is only at level 32 which is completely insufficient to deal with highlevel demon beasts yugu asked in Surprise the security Captain's level is only 32 kin Ru calmly explained our team belongs to the tan chuang group you must have heard of that name since this area mainly consists of small residential Apartments the entire safe Zone has been built by the tan chuang group images of a modern luxurious residential area filled with Advanced facilities appeared in her mind tears of sadness welled up in her eyes as she said this month happened to be the turn of the tan chuang group to handle the security of the night Zone but the group did not send high ranking members for the security rotation only a few low-level members like us to respond I never expected this to happen she stepped closer to yiu earnestly saying brother please go with me stay in this night Zone sooner or later we will be eaten by demon beasts I have a map of this area and know a secret route that leads to the eight Zone my family is there so as long as we return there we will be safe you saved my life I cannot just watch you rush into a place of death y woo turned around cold boldly after hearing her words refusing no need thank you for your kindness but my family is still here I cannot leave them behind in his heart he felt a hint of sarcasm want a deserter huh but this is quite normal suddenly a massive demon Beast appeared in front of Yu it snarled I didn't expect two humans to still be here what luck the information system popped up Swift gry leapard level 30 all stats are very high kin ru screamed level 30 demon Beast y wo glanced at the monster pondering when did this thing show up it's too fast I didn't even notice suddenly the demon Beast spotted kin Ru and growled as it approached her she immediately pushed Yu towards it and turned to flee in her mind she reminded herself a level 30 demon Beast I definitely can't fight it I can't die here my mother is still waiting at home how can I die here she ran faster a feeling of Shame welling up inside her tears brimming in her eyes I'm sorry brother pushing you to be bait is too cruel but I'm truly sorry the Swift gry leapard looked back at y Wu but did not attack him instead it chased after kin Ru Yi Wu stood and watched shouting in Anger you humans really are not anything good pushing others into danger to save yourselves the Swift gray leapard said I want to eat you first today roar roar roar the demon Beast raised its claws and charged towards kin Ru she was panicking crying out for help no please brother save me Yu Stood Still hands in his pockets not even bothering to look back or lend a hand he let the demon Beast attack as the Swift gry leapard said save what let me know on you first then he won't Escape either ha kin Ru Was Bitten and torn by the demon Beast screaming in agony seeing this Yi Wu could no longer look on indifferently and quickly launched an attack at the Swift gray leapard the demon Beast focused on kin Ru was caught off guard by the sudden strike causing it to widen its eyes in pain and let out a cry roar roar it cried out before being completely eliminated the system announced you have received a reward of 5,000 experience points for defeating kin Ru was seriously injured grinning her teeth in pain and forced herself to open her eyes to look at y Wu shamefully saying I'm I'm sorry Yi Wu coldly looked down at her and replied I don't blame you in this era living for oneself is not wrong but you must pay the price for your choices and do not blame me he glanced at her bleeding wound indifferently continuing I don't have the ability to heal if you don't bandage it you will die kin Ru tried to take the map out and handed it to Y woo I do not blame you but I must apologize to you this map may be useful to you so please forgive me after saying that her eyes gradually rolled up tears flow from the corners of her eyes blood gushed from her mouth and then she stopped breathing in her hand she still tightly grasped the map Yi Wu sat down and gently stroked her face silently conveying you do not need my forgiveness you were not at fault for your selfishness but for your weakness because in this age weakness is a sin this is true for both humans and Demon beasts Only the Strong can stand at the Pinnacle he took the map from kin ru's hand reassuring himself therefore I can only become stronger and stronger to protect my family and friends holding the map in his hand y wo shouted loudly parents yanf Nana wait for me I will come to fetch everyone immediately system notification the host has picked up the night's safe zone map by Blood In Another Place soldiers and tanks were stationed the loudspeaker announced from headquarters we are the swordfish Squad escorting civilians to shelter number five currently everything is still normal from a distance the solders shouts echoed damn demon Beast The Tall Man Standing On Top of the tank was Wang jungo a level 32 Captain with a cigarette in his mouth he angrily said what bad luck to run into a demon Beast attacking the city otherwise I would be relaxing drinking and playing cards by now the young man next to him carrying a gun smiled and said although the boss is fierce he's the most enthusiastic when it comes to receiving missions this young man was Shen bang a level 25 team member he added with a grin I heard that some teams have already retreated to Zone 8 but we are still here striving to complete our mission Wang Jong guo tightened his grip around Shen Bing's neck laughing as he said why are you so talkative today is there some good news hurry up and tell me Shen Bing in the grip started to sweat and quickly replied oh there's no good news boss spare me while the two were still joking around the radio crackled to life reporting boss it's not good the girl kin Ru has lost contact she was in touch before but now we can't reach her both shouted in udison what Shen Bing anxiously asked boss is something wrong with kin Ru could it be that she has been devoured by a demon Beast why Jen go closed his eyes with a different line of thought we cleared the area in a short time there shouldn't be any danger kin Ru has probably left Shen Bing was astonished left Wang Jen Gul clenched his fist angrily saying she is usually very timid scared earlier she took the initiative to contact me which made me let my guard down damn it hearing this Shen Bing also said in Anger boss let me go find her even if she did something wrong it's too dangerous to leave her to go alone we Jang go thought for a moment and then decided let the girl go he stood looking at the burning City in front of him calmly saying right or wrong doesn't matter anymore at this point besides living for oneself isn't wrong if the girl has decided to leave the team she must take responsibility for her own actions we do not need to intervene Shen Bing took out a shared photo with kin Ru regretfully saying I understand now why Jango stared at the group of people taking refuge in the distance silently thinking it's strange among these civilians there is a family that has a level 20 girl what on Earth is going on yanf was still trying to make contact but the signal was poor only receiving the sound of zzz she was worried and thought no I still can't reach him why is it so distorted at this moment other men walking around were astonished to see the small girl carrying a bag on her shoulder that was three or four times heavier than her own body she walked steadily smiled at yanf and said sister yanf don't worry the master will definitely be fine yanf turned her head in shock upon seeing this scene a middle-aged woman next to the girl shilly said sorry Nana it's just that Aunt packed too many things if you feel tired just lighten the load Nana smiled and said Aunt don't worry too much this is nothing on the surface she smiled but internally she was already cursing what is this planet doing has it gone crazy a bunch of low-level beings are battling it out one misstep and they could lose their lives barely managing to be reborn I still want to conquer this planet make them kneel at my feet I can't die here the system announced in the safe Zone evacuation area number five of the safety District ninth to file and enter special Authority in front is a gate definitely engraved with the EUR on on it outside the door two armed men stand guard shouting loudly stop a man approaches the vehicle leading the group of evacu and asks which unit are you from Shen Bing stands at top the vehicle leans down and replies we are the swordfish team security code XB 36d escorting civilians to safety the guards quickly clear the way confirming open the gate as the vehicle is moving inside suddenly everyone shouts the ground the ground is shaking What's Happening a demon Beast bursts up from the ground throwing the vehicle aside ah that demon Beast is a 30-foot demon snake the soldiers urgently shout signals to each other it's a zerg the enemy is attacking prepare for battle next come the Roars of other demon beasts two more demon beasts suddenly appear attacking other vehicles a 25 level evil bull and an 18 level hard horn werewolf they excitedly say so much delicious food it's worth the wait for the Ambush haha a demon Beast resembling a wild boar jumps onto a nearby vehicle frightening demon Pig level 20 the group of soldiers rush to shout there is a large number of demon beasts behind begin suppressing Firepower a however before they can do anything the demon beasts charged in to attack everyone it has been a long time since I could kill comfortably like this to today I have to play in my heart's content people panicked and fled in a frenzy run fast ah don't come here don't eat me my meat isn't tasty at all the frightening demon P excitedly said don't worry I'm not picky HHA Wang Jango quickly rushed over shoving it away from the crowd go to hell you stinking Pig the demon Beast that was shoved Cried Out gal gal gal haha in his mind he guessed zuru is cooperating with the demon beasts this isn't normal Wang Jango quickly turned around and then ordered Shen Bing follow me to deal with that level 30 Zerg the demon beasts are for the others Shen Bing quickly ran over to Wang Jango yes boss Wang jangu thought this isn't a coincidence there must be someone commanding from behind what is their goal he instructed Shen Bing I will draw it aggro you keep an eye on on its Health Shen Bing quickly acknowledged the order understood on this side the crowd was panicking and fleeing there was a piercing scream from Yu's mother husband fay fay Nana where is everyone a she was trampled underfoot by the rushing crowd help the hard horn werewolf chased after its red eyes fixed sharply on her it's you it quickly raised its Hand high starting with targets that can't run like you haha at that moment an arrow struck its hand don't touch my mother yanf stood in front the two shouted mom and dad hurry and run I will hold it back she worriedly said while deep inside she thought the equipment bought from the black market is finally useful I wonder if it can take it down the hard horn werewolf pulled the arrows from its hand angrily shouting hemp I didn't expect you to be level seven yet still be able to shoot one Arrow it hurts so much but that's not enough to defeat me Yun Fay over here immediately knocked another arrow to shoot at the demon Beast is that so three arrows aren't enough then here's another one the hard horn werewolf quickly dodged the arrows don't think just because you have good weapons you can win you're not ready yet even if your weapons are good it leaked and bit at the arrows while provocatively saying we've studied your kind very thoroughly let me take your entire family out Yun Fay stood in front of her parents blocking their way Mom and Dad go quickly her parents hubbed each other and stood there saying to Yun Fe no yanf without you even if we are alive it has no meaning anymore yanf stood in front to protect her parents she closed her eyes and silently apologized I'm sorry brother I can't protect my parents I am too weak I'm really sorry suddenly a sword slashed severing both arms of the hard horn werewolf it stared in shock then a series of Sword strikes followed and the demon Beast was annihilated on the spot roar roar roar yanf looked in astonishment Nana you you can fight I thought you were just a service robot n about it thinking to herself it's not that I want to my body is moving uncontrollably what a hassle the system announced Hearn experience value 5,000 level up n raised her hand thinking in amazement this feeling it seems I can control my body better now so this is the rule of this world as long as I keep killing demon beasts I can become stronger and gain better control of this body thinking this way her face became Sinister a faint smile on her lips haha wonderful this simple and understandable rule suits me perfectly well then let's start killing Nana's eyes were a fiery red as she excitedly charged into the group of demon beasts the demon Beast roared red red the color I hate the most is red while roaring the demon Beast chased after a young man dressed in red the young man in fear shouted help someone come save me Nana successfully defeated the demon Beast and the system announced gain valuable experience points 5,000 she gleefully laughed haha valuable experience points just came to me but I still haven't leveled up Nana revealed a face of excitement thinking after I level up the experience points will also become more so this is how the mechanism works the people around her marvelled a little girl like this is so powerful indeed why not the frightening demon Pig was so scared that it turned to flee brother knew I'm sorry wait until I train to level 30 I will definitely come back to tear her apart saying such strong words but deep down it was terrified thinking this girl can kill us both in an instant stronger than any human I don't want to die my life is more important suddenly a streak of light shot towards the frightening demon Pig startling it what what sound is chasing me but before she could turn back it had already screamed and then died nanao once again claimed the reward and the system announc gained a valuable experience reward of 4,500 she smiled Riley level 30 although raising it to get fat and then eating it is quite wonderful I don't have the patience for that meanwhile another side was engaged in a fierce battle Shin Bing yelled don't look around anymore Captain Wang Jang guo replied sorry I was checking the battle situation over there I didn't expect the little girl to have taken care of all the demon beasts over there really surprising ha Shen Bing was administering healing to the captain wanting to bend over and say now is not the time to celebrate the life value of this insect has dropped to half we must be wary of its mutations these types of Zerg all have mutation abilities the thousand foot demon snake after a while of fighting with the two turned into a reward Spinning Wheel are you also skillful but humans who see this form of mind will die very miserably you are no exception Wang Jang heard this but still showed no fear balding stain damn it your mouth is right but it only turns into a ball can still handle it the thousand foot demon snake upon hearing this became Furious balla damn it you know a ball this is just my mutated form Brothers come on suck them dry the thousand foot demon snake exploded then summoned butterfly Village larva level 15 20 Wang Jang Gua was surprised to see this that bastard has been Torn to Pieces each piece and there are still so many the butterfly Village larvae having gained a large number of allies all crawled onto Wang Jango causing him to scream damn it they are sucking my blood Shen ban bearing the team upon hearing this rushed over hang in there Captain I'm coming to save you Shen bin thought damn it my props and magic powers are all depleted I can only try to draw the aggro I hope the captain can take the opportunity to escape seeing this Wang jangu shouted to stop him don't come here to death take the chance I'll try to hold them here you run now as he spoke he thought is this where it ends aoy sh May images of the past appeared before his eyes outside the safe Zone in the wild Village Wine jang's family was sending him off to work the little girl sh might cheered dad do your best wine jangu gave a thumbs up to the mother and child don't worry sh I I will definitely be selected once I join the security team of T chuang group our family can enter the safe Zone and live a worry-free life but before the good news could be reported his family was killed by a monster Wang jeno screamed in agony we had a clear appointment but I failed to keep my promise demon Beast these monsters are being killed these days and the demon beasts are still not all dead at that moment wne jangu revealed his ability causing butterfly Village larvae to fly out from his body he shouted shouted how can I die here then the butterfly Village larvae were swiftly dealt with by Nana's power Nana revealed a killing in 10 and said are you still alive what a Pity if you were just a second later I could have swallowed even your experience points in one go the thousand foot demon snake exclaimed in shock who are you in an instant you can destroy half of my body it hurts so much damn it after saying that the monster transformed into a frenzy form screaming I will tear you apart leaving nothing for you to experience this pain Wang Jen guo was helped up by Shen Bing and upon seeing the thousand foot demon snake transform he intervened damn it this bug has entered a frenzied State we can't fight like this after Nana finished listening she scolded shut up your low carbon-based law of life is an insult to me hoping your eyes wide and see what the ultimate form of transcendence truly is then Nana transformed into an ultra combat rocket suit astonishing even the thousand foot demon snake how can this be How could an ordinary person without giving the demon Beast a chance to reply Nana said one word die then she fired Rockets to obliterate the thousand foot demon snake it screamed in pain aha you were not human after the explosive shock Nana confidently declared human how could I be a low-level life form Nana effortlessly claimed the reward and the system announced wealth experience gained 10,000 level up to 22 money acquired 1,000 obtained items a leg of the thousand foot demon snake level 30 magic Crystal before she could Revel in her Victory Nana suddenly fell silent thinking wait what's going on I have no strength left I can't make a sound anymore just as she collapsed to the ground y yanf group arrived in time Nana leader Wang are you all okay Nana aren you all right why aren't you moving someone explained perhaps that last attack depleted all her body's energy although Nana remained motionless she still felt uncomfortable due to the physical contact thinking clearly the Consciousness is still very alert damn it even though I don't want to have any interaction with lower life forms for even a moment let you hold on for a bit ye then F said leader Wang here are two vials of recovery potion everyone should take the opportunity to recover Wang Jen replied thank you girl after she was treated Wang Jango sent to yay Yan Fe besides your Refuge number five I suspect the other refuges are not safe either this time the demon beasts ambushing us is very strange they seem to know a lot about us humans I suggest we immediately go to Safe Zone number eight and transfer there yayun Fe looking worried said but if we do that it will be far from my brother how will he be able to find us let me contact him y Yan Fe turned all the communication device brother can you hear me Yu's voice echoed back beep beep yanf she said the connection is established but the signal feels like a punch to the face y Yan Fe worriedly said are you okay everyone is in Refuge number five Nana and the security team have saved everyone and we will immediately head to Safe Zone number eight however the signal was too weak and Yi Wu also lost connection with Y Yan Fe she was angry damn it the signal is lost I wonder if my previous message reached my brother W Jen Gul reassured her don't worry if you want to send a message to your brother I have a way yean feay was surprised really wi jelo said it's very simple just leave it to me and then you should get out of here back with Y wo at refugee camp M five he stood in front of the rubble worried we just went through a major battle I have no idea if Yun FEI and everyone else are safe what is that wall over there is it the message Yun Fe left behind but what do these numbers mean fortunately Yi Wu was a good student so he quickly remembered these are the internal code numbers of the security team previously the security team came to school for a science popularization seminar of of course I wouldn't have missed that detail Yu began searching around apologizing to the victims I'm sorry brother I have to find out if there are any more communication devices after a long search yiu finally found about five devices looking at the collection of devices in his hands he felt disheartened although I have found quite a few using the skills of a master engineer I still can't get them to function the system explained because the connection level of the host is insufficient you cannot repair the communication devices and use them normally Yi Wu reassured himself my red eye has not cooled down yet and its range is limited right now I cannot rush to Safe Zone 8 so it is crucial to find time to contact Yuni and everyone furthermore it is unclear whether safe Zone 8 can accommodate civilians from zone 9 you thought the nearby Night Market definitely has communication devices from taian shuang group I must hurry over there in the black market of safe zone 9 monsters lay dead in heaps scattered everywhere YW guested it seems this place has just gone through a fierce battle hopefully I won't be running through here in vain suddenly a curse rang out who dares to barge into the black market at this time do you want to die a thousand bullets rained down from above Yu hurriedly used his shield and felt relieved to see that the enemy still had some fight left it seems you are still alive so I can rest assured a different voice rang out stop y Wu is one of us saou stepped out from within sorry y wo there was a major battle earlier someone with a screw loose is still following us Yu replied no need to worry I'm fine saiou wondered why are you at the Black Market at this time Yi Wu explained I actually have some matters and would like to ask Miss saou for help saou enthusiastically responded no problem come in side and we can talk stepping in yu notice everyone still sitting calmly their attitude as if nothing than usual was happening the outside is in chaos like this yet they can still sit here drinking saou gently clarified right now more than half of the people drinking here are Relic Hunters their purpose for coming is money good wine and beautiful women as for the lives of civilians or demon beasts they basically don't care y woo brushed past the crowd secretly evaluating clearly they have great strength and high levels yet they only know how to sitck here drunkenly but I have no standing to blame their choices you wve asked Miss sa youu can you contact M from your side hearing this sa you joked eldest Miss why are you asking about the eldest Miss as soon as you arrive can't you show a little concern for her she's terrified to death right now Yu shy said at this point stop joking I really have urgent matters in his heart he thought moreover I don't see her being scared at all saou returned with a serious demeanor sat down on a chair and said logically speaking the eldest Miss probably hasn't left area number nine yet I've been trying to use the internal safety Network to contact her but all the intercoms are just static upon hearing this youu guessed static if she's unable to establish contact either then that proves my assumption the intercome issue isn't a coincidence it's being deliberately interfered with it seems like they're using special radio waves to communicate with each other saou was surprised interference How could a demon Beast do that yiu replied in any case there's something off about this but we still can't draw a conclusion right now I have three things I want to ask missu for help with saou decisively agreed what do you need just tell me he explained without hesit ation the first is to help me find the intercoms from the security team of tan chuang group the second is medication for treating virtual debuff the third is whether the okora cloak from the previous auction is still available if it is could you give me an advance on the payment before y Wu could finish speaking SAU interjected why are you being so distant with me talking about money can easily hurt feelings that coat originally belonged to you and as for the walkie-talkie and medicament I will have someone arranged to find them right away yiu simply thanked her and said nothing more the system announced saou wants to make a deal with you do you accept y Wu clicked agree while understanding that although SAU said this he knew talking about money can hurt feelings but feelings can sometimes waste money even more there are times when debts of gratitude cannot fundamentally be measured in money the system replied accept it the host has obtained the Royal cloak not long after saou subordinates came to report big sister everything you needed has been found saou instructed deliver them directly to ywu he received the walkie-talkie and said thank you let me see how it operated got it directly input snmg 4 trillion 715 billion 9911 million 51,3 immediately a voice came through the line beep beep hello you are y Yan fe's brother right y Wu joyfully replied that's right it's me finally I managed to get in touch the voice on the other end said wait a moment let me call Yan Fe to talk yian fe's voice echoed brother it's me yanf Yi Wu couldn't hide his anxious feelings and quickly asked is everyone okay where are Mom and Dad are they all right she cheerfully replied everyone is fine earlier our home was attacked by demon beasts and while we were preparing to move to Refuge zone no five we were ambushed by demon beasts and others zgs thanks to Nana and leader way from the security team who spoke with you just now they saved us y Yan continued but Nana's energy has been depleted and she can't move right now everyone is heading to zone no eight and for now it is safe we are all carefully avoiding the demon beasts on the way hearing this ye W side and belief so that's how it is the situation has been resolved but he then thought Nana truly does not disappoint me but the current issue is that Nana cannot act so how should we deal with this the system appeared and said the owner's inquiry has been received there are many ways to replenish energy from Mecca however considering the current situation the simplest and most brutal method is to use a higher magic Crystal to directly replenish her energy y w heard this and said to his younger sister yanf you can directly use a magic Crystal of level over 20 to replenish Nana's energy remember it is crucial to help Nana recover her ability to act her combat strength cannot be lacking Yan replied right I killed the level 30 monster earlier so let me go check I will hand the intercom over to leader Wang hearing this y Wu said okay next he communicated with the captain leader Wang based on my prediction if everyone tries to go back to area 8 directly through the connection Bridge it won't be possible Yi Wu opened the safe area 9 plan map examined it and explained because there must be a large number of civilians taking Refuge there it is very unsafe let me provide you with the coordinates Wang Jang gu was surprised when he saw this these coordinates are little boy how do you know the secret coordinates of this passage isn't this the coordinates kin Ru often mentions before hanging up Yu reminded one last time these are the secret coordinates to go to area 8 we'll meet there my family's safety depends on you Wang jenu replied okay you can rest assured Yi Wu exited the main hall thinking it's necessary to buy more healing potions for insurance though the prices are a bit expensive he thought to himself these unscrupulous Merchants really know how to make money I am completely bankrupt now just then in the distance he heard the voice of a girl surrounded by a group of men pleading please my parents are still outside can you take me to see them I will pay you well the red-haired young man laughed mockingly pay you well what money does a mere waitress like you have one of the group began to make advances speaking in a crude tone but if you use your body to pay I might reconsider the crowd chorused exactly serve me and who knows we might agree the girl dressed in a bunny outfit was terrified hugging herself tightly struggling to resist don't please the group laughed grotesquely reaching out to drag her away suddenly a powerful arm intervened yiu stepped forward smiling as he said girl as long as you answer me two questions I'll consider helping you a bit the Pervert had his arm Twisted by y woo screaming in agony ah ah let go it's broken what it hurts so much y wo asked first where is your house second and most importantly he looked at her with sparkling eyes how much money are you offering the girl opened a map and pointed to yiu the location of her house my house is right here is that okay yiu thought to himself if it's that location it's conveniently on the way to that coordinate I can take her along without any problem however he still pretended to be troubled the position is not an issue but about the money can you the girl immediately quoted a price 1 million I will give a deposit of 1 million if I can find my family I will give you another million this is all my fortune she looked at him with a pitiful expression the group of young men nearby heard and laughed mockingly no way is that much money real or fake How could a waitress like her have so much money isn't this a joke another guy chimed in if I had known waitressing could earn so much money I wouldn't need to be a relic Hunter I want to try it too saou whispered to yiu her name is Maya yya although she is only level 10 she has a special ability for sensing she can feel the energy waves around her which also includes the emotions of humans because of that she always receives the affection of the guests her record in recommending various types of alcohol is always the best it's not surprising that she has a bit of savings Yu found this interesting he chuckled softly so that's it truly a remarkable ability at this moment the two men who had previously harassed meow y immediately changed their attitude wanting to escort her home one of the men grinned wickedly do you have money why didn't you say so earlier it was all just a misunderstanding as long as you agree to give us money we will do everything we can to protect you the other man chimed in with a smile that's right usually we move freely in the wilderness outside the safe Zone not afraid of any beasts at all MI felt a bit awkward and shook her head but I have already agreed with that person over there at that moment the chubby man stepped forward and yelled at ywu a level five kiddo huh that was just my carelessness earlier now let's see a punch from me blow your dog head off the man with a buzz cut beside him chimed in little girl don't be fooled by the looks of this type of person in this era what does being handsome matter without skills you'll be eaten by beasts when you go outside Yu had just Unleashed his skills and the level 30 bald man was sent flying to the ceiling almost dying on the spot the crowd witnessing couldn't help but Marvel this is really strange y Wu tightened his fists his voice cold I can tolerate trash talk but what's absolutely intolerable is that someone dares to block my path to wealth after finishing his words he lifted his leg and delivered a powerful kick that knocked the bald man down left him trembling he bent down his close to the Shivering bald man who was terrified and pleaded boss I was wrong please spare my life Mi yaa watched from the side her heart racing her eyes sparkling she couldn't hide her admiration wow not only is he handsome but he's also strong saou couldn't help but Marvel inwardly it's only been a few days since we last met and he can easily overpower a level 30 opponent like this y woo you truly are a mysterious monster I'm getting more and more interested in you as Yu was leaving he said let's go I'm in a hurry but let me say this first on the way you have to listen to me don't cause trouble Mi y hurriedly ran after him okay I will follow all your instructions just before leaving yiu turned back and asked saou saou do you have any plans from what I see if you stayed here sooner or later you will become a bird in a cage how about coming along as soon as the the words left yiwu's lips the group of saou became Furious one of them stood in front of the door shouting loudly did you all hear that this guy dares to call us bastards isn't he looking for death damn it if you're tough say it again immediately saou spoke up her tone firm stop anyone who dares to touch him is showing no respect for HMO group saying that she walked over hooked her arm around Yo's and gently said okay I'll go with you you're absolutely right hiding here forever is not a solution moreover I need to find a way to contact the young lady Yu stood in the middle entangled by both saou and mow yaa feeling a bit awkward miow yay happily exclaimed it's awesome that saou sister is also going along sau's willingness to go with Y Wu made no one dare to stop them anymore watching y wo leave the two beautiful women out of the black market the crowd couldn't help but follow with envy and jealousy some people remarked lucky him he's got two beauties with him but what's there to Envy it's just heading out to look for death just a few steps outside and he'll be crying to come back for hell everyone burst into laughter mocking the scene shifted to a desolate Place filled with ruined buildings under the dlight of dusk Yi Wu saou and M yeah had all changed their outfits saou adjusted her jacket jokingly asked so have you fallen for sisters sleigh posture yet Mio yeah stood behind her nodded and whispered I will listen to everyone Yu looked at the two of them and sigh all right let's hurry up so we won't be late anyway the screenwriter won't let me do anything with you girls at that moment Fierce lightning appear in the sky bright and threatening SAU suddenly pointed up and exclaimed ah everyone look what is that Mi grimaced observed and said doesn't seem like normal lightning suddenly a gigantic Beast emerged from the bolts of lightning tearing the entire Sky apart you who looked on expression serious this is bad the space is torn open that giant claw has the Beast taking advantage of that Rift to come out the enormous claws swept through smashing a building and sending dust flying everywhere Mio was stunned stuttering was that Building attacked the black market saou stood silent for a moment a fleeting sense of relief passing through her eyes she thought to herself leaving with Y wo was indeed the right decision but soon after she looked around her expression thoughtful what should we do next if everything from that space escapes we will have nowhere to run Yu frowned his voice grave this level of Beast something's not right this completely surpasses the realm of beasts it's like he suddenly realized something murmuring quietly oh old God sa you half believed half doubted asked back old God you mean the old God descended to Earth since the world began to change how could that be Yu explained this is just my speculation the folklore materials passed down at that time were indeed a mix of Truth and falsehood Mi suddenly held her head crying out in pain saou anxiously asked Mio yaah what's wrong with You Mio Yi trembled and said who I can feel a cold evil energy spreading underground she pointed in a certain direction it is gathering over there yiu hesitated for a moment looking in the direction she pointed it's completely opposite to where we are supposed to meet yanf what should we do even though I need to quickly regroup with Yuni and everyone my intuition tells me that the source of that evil power is definitely related to that old God I absolutely cannot ignore it after calming down you W turn to the two girls saou and M yaa now I have to go towards the source of that evil power to see what's going on therefore you two have two choices either come with me or I will give you the coordinates of safe Zone number nine the two girls did not hesitate expressing their desire to stand by Yu's side and decisively said I will go with you if that old God is really in the sky don't mention safe zone 9 even the area above and below Zone 3 cannot Escape misfortune she continued that's right I will follow you as well miyang asserted if we can't stop that big guy in the sky my parents won't be safe either Yu had no choice but to agree then it's settled although with our current strength we can't stop it we must clarify that things related to these bizarre occurrences can you keep up with me after saying that the three of them accelerated towards the source of the gathered energy the closer they got the more Mo yay could sense the source of this energy is indeed right here just ahead the concentration of evil power has reached its peak hasn't it ye Wu warned while observing wait everyone hide behind me it seems there are other sounds coming from that direction suddenly figures in Black cloaks appeared ahead continuously chanting around a red Crystal their bodies emanating Sparks Yu thought to himself what on Earth are those people doing within the crystal strange and terrifying skulls gradually became visible yiu said it's the formation that is channeling energy to tear open the space SAU looked at the three cloak figures and said what are we waiting for their power level isn't High disrupting the formation can prevent The Descent of the old God ye W suddenly realized wait things are not as simple as that as soon as he finished speaking he saw saou and meyette charging forward with lightning speed their attacks repeatedly slammed into the protective Circle but all were deflected back does the shielding energy really have skills like that Yu frowned damn it could it be that such an important formation has no defense at all he used an explosive firebomb secretly thinking the issue now lies in the level of this shielding energy after I change my attack Talent will I be able to break through it he rushed forward and struck hard at the protective barrier but the result was still it backfired Yu side indeed I can't break it this shielding energy must be at least level 60 he continued to ponder even though I've gained quite a bit of experience points before the situation has changed now I must upgrade my attack power to cope with this situation I need to accumulate experience to open a new account only then will I have a chance to win looking around he noticed the strangeness of the situation we have such a large attack formation yet these people don't have any reaction at all saou was a bit surprised even yiwu's attack was was ineffective what should we do this time Mio yes said anxiously do we really have to just stand by and watch is that terrifying thing up there coming down Yi Wu reassured everyone don't rush I will think of a way to deal with it he secretly asked the robot I Vis analyze a bit is there any Gap in this energy Shield that we can exploit the robot I Vis with a serious expression as if preparing for battle replied no problem Master analyzing analysis complete this is the small matter I can solve it in 0.01 seconds immediately afterwards I viz analyze the information Epic Level protective energy the energy Shields positioning level is 65 the intelligence index of its creator is unclear it seems that all related information has been erased based on the remaining imagery on the surface the original symbol has been modified y Wu looked at the image surprised this symbol belongs to the Huang xen group why are they involved he thought to himself this is similar to the small energy Shield I encountered with the black tiger Team all coming from the Huang Jen group if so I have a bold idea yiu said and took out a stone that looked exactly like the symbol on the bloody red Crystal and threw it towards the formation unexpectedly the stone easily passed through the formation at this moment Yu confirmed that his initial guess was correct indeed products of the same type from the same company have a certain consistency he thought to himself then turned to the robot and said AV Vis check my inventory for any items that can be modified or merged with this masking energy the robot quickly responded at your command checking found it it is the turbo amplifier using this item as a practical material can upgrade the protective capability the robot continued to explain the level 6 5 turbo amplifier is a component for modifying the engines of cars and airplanes capable of significantly enhancing power output and supplementing the private energy income hearing this Yu became uneasy private energy income huh if I use it directly the principal won't blame me right it's just for keeping it safe the demon version of a vis whispered in his ear as if tempting him Master don't hesitate keeping it for him means that once it's in your pocket it's yours y wo at that moment casually hit I Vis on the head saying sorry principal I'm just doing this out of necessity you'll understand me right after that Yi Wu took out the turbo and the magical stone from earlier shouting loudly Fusion 1 second later the system announced congratulations to the host on obtaining a grade s instrument for the new exam a level 65 turbo field generator after undergoing modifications it has acquired an even stronger reverse field the duration and durability value are all increasing rapidly yiu joyfully took the newly produced instrument threw it towards the formation and shouted go turbo the amplitude growth of the reverse field for the turbo unleash all destructive power from within for me saou was astonished and said is he trying to use his own field energy to eliminate the existing field mioya praised wow how could you think of such a method so clever ywu only explained no no fields of equivalent levels cannot cancel each other out my intention is to take advantage of the reverse field for a short time to bind the energy of the magic crystal forming a shortcut internally before he could finish the shortcut he mentioned had already been formed the internal energy reacted uncontrollably causing the Three Men In Black cloaks to be battered by the energy the cloes of all three people were ripped apart in an instant revealing various patterns on their bodies ah oh my that's just too tragic the uncontrolled energy had been struck Yu suddenly realized the energy Shield began to shatter and was stunned not good the force field is about to collapse I didn't expect it to hold only for such a short time he quickly turned at SAU and Miya telling them come closer to me hide behind me quickly the two girls were surprised they hadn't had time to ask anything when a loud bang echoed the energy Shield exploded and the blood red magic Crystal was blown to Pieces a huge deep pit appeared before the three of them Yu thought he was going to die and felt unwilling damn it I completely underestimated the power of the explosion from the magic Crystal but I clearly changed my defensive Talent so why is it still so hard to breathe so uncomfortable when yiu regained Consciousness he discovered M yay was actually sitting right on his face which was why he felt so breathless mioya asked are you okay with her sitting on him yeu could only reply oh oh he hurriedly said quickly get your butt off me saou buried her face into him astonished H the power of this explosion is just too strong Mio ya looked ahead in astonishment and then said to the others everyone quick look at the sky the rift in space is shrinking saou cheerfully replied that's right it's great our efforts weren't in vain y Wu helplessly shouted you you I'm telling you all get off me right now don't sit on me and talk anymore after that yiu walked over to the pit and discovered that nearly all of the three men from earlier were dead leaving only one alive the guy who had exploded so close and yet was still alive well what a timely a a who it hurts so much y Wu helped one man up and asked who are you guys tell me your purpose and I might save your life the man suddenly erupted in Flames maniacally laughing and shouting haha cold world King's Landing Club Long Live you we suddenly realized damn it this is a loud explosion went off right next to him causing saou and mo yya to scream V woo after the self-donation of one of the tattooed bald men everyone assumed Yu had gone down with him fortunately he quickly acted activated his shield and was unharmed you Wu then sat there and thought I never would have expected that without a word he would just explode this is a form of self-destruction leaving no Trace behind how cruel luckily my innate defense isn't just for show from afar Mio y's voice echoed Li woo it's good that you're okay Yi wo turned around and when he saw the remaining scoundrel that scoundrel is still here I must keep him alive to get some answers suddenly he gathered his strength to self-destruct along with the previous one he shouted loudly haha cold world King's Landing Club Long Live cold world Kings Landing Club Long Live everyone saw that the situation was not good and worriedly said to him this is this guy is about to self- detonate again Yu was cautious internally cursing damn it to keep the secret he's willing to sacrifice his life completely brainwashed suddenly that guy immediately went blank he was puzzled not understanding what was happening hauh hearing the term brainwash from saou Yi Wu had an idea brainwash ha I know that too the server immediately announced mind control skill activated triggering physical resonance in the mind duration 60 seconds the two girls were suddenly confused not understanding the situation the guy then cout out reverently at Yu's feet saying the lofty new God the citizens humbly submit to your teachings after hearing that y Wu also found it strange new god what the hell is that I just controlled your mind but didn't intend for you to flatter me saou was astonished upon witnessing this from behind mind control since when have you learned this technique yigu replied you're overthinking it saou this skill I just learned hasn't been used yet I'm just taking this chance to practice a bit on him after replying to you y Wu immediately ordered the guy explain clearly the cold world Kings Landing club and your purpose within 1 minute upon receiving the command he complied instantly yes new God the cold world Kings Landing Club is a secret society of many Believers the Believers come from various sectors professions and social classes among them are not few Elite and Powerful figures although people's identities and social standings differ they share a common goal that is to await the return of the old God only when the old God descends can this end bringing Humanity to a new glorious world after receiving the clear explanation from the guy ye W grasp some information the old God can end this huh how can they believe in such nonsensical words Yu thought to himself it's even more unbelievable than hoping for my own end like this suddenly a thought arose in Yu's mind but summoning the old God and the Beast attacking the city why do they appear at the same time in this is there any relation between them saou heard this and said in the world there are actually many Cults that worship the old gods but it's all just outward appearances after all no one has ever seen what the old gods look like let alone summon them Mio yaa hearing this was also puzzled but can this cold World kingk Landing Club really call upon the old gods y Wu continued to interrogate the guy so how did you manage to successfully summon the old gods and what about this formation where does this huge red magic Crystal and the tattoo on your body come from the guy responded this pattern is a sacred magic pattern only those chosen by the gods can be worthy of having it tattooed on them as for the formation and the magic Crystal they are also a means to call upon the old gods but my rank is not enough and I really don't know the details y wo seeing this pretended to be displeased with the evasive answer do you dare to hide something The Man became terrified in front of Y Wu bowing his head until it bled no no no how could I dare to hide anything from you your existence is even greater than that of the old gods and I am the most devout and loyal citizen for you I would give my very life I absolutely would not dare to deceive you Yu was surprised by his absolute loyalty this name is loyal to a fault it's better to say it's insane in the final question ye would have asked one last last question does the cold world Kings Landing Club have anything to do with this Beast Invasion he immediately replied of course it is related because the Beast attacking the city was all masterminded by the cold world King's Landing Club because he hadn't finished speaking suddenly his attitude changed completely by 180° the old God descends and demands countless lives you all are the sacrificial offerings saying this he activated self-destruction Yi Wu quickly turned his back activating the protective shield and tightly hubbed the two girls carefully he exploded leaving not a trace or fragment of Flesh luckily no one is injured y was irritated damn it clearly it hasn't even been a minute why did this guy suddenly lose control could it be that after smashing his head in madness he managed to break free from my control as the situation was tense Mio yya blushed and said sweetly V woo your strength is really impressive you hurt me meanwhile saou looked at the main character with an entranced gaze so how come your strength is so great I'm not paying attention but you should get even stronger y Wu appeared confused uh sorry are you too okay mi replied I'm fine thank you as foru it seemed as if y Wu had mesmerized her she softly said why let go I want hug a bit longer this man indeed has a strange charm you wo approached the spot where the formation and the magic Crystal were destroyed exhausted after a day of examination and finally had some findings the cold world Kings Landing Club is truly not simple not only did they conspire to Ambush the city with beasts but they can also summon the old God their skill and ambition are even greater than those corporations that only care about making money I might have ruined their plans could that become a Target why worry about it the server then explained about the magic Crystal the properties of this item are hidden and require a special divination tool beyond the standard limits to unravel the attributes hearing this yiu felt quite perplexed what the properties are locked and still need a divination tool it seems they have processed specific security measures for the magic Crystal IIs can you identify it the robot replied of course Master such a trivial matter shouldn't be a challenge for me after a moment of analysis the robot announced you have obtained the blood of the magic Crystal this is the ancient magic Crystal and the blood has been refined from it the majority of its composition is human blood with a small amount being blood from Beasts yugu looked at the detail analysis table and thought it seems a lot of people have been killed truly cruel is this fresh blood being sacrificed to the old God but aside from humans there is also blood from Beasts which is quite unusual it seems I have encountered a very big problem suddenly you Yu's intercom emitted an indistinct sound ywu was taken aback the intercom is producing static could it be that the intercom is being disturbed by this type of magic Crystal Mio yay suddenly saw something in the sky and shouted loudly to Signal the other two quick look up at the sky in the sky was a red space although the Gap in the space had stopped expanding it had not completely disappeared it seemed that simply destroying one formation could not completely halt the summoning ual y Wu stood in front of the balance struggling to find equilibrium so we continue right if we do my family will be in danger but if we give up like this there's no guarantee that the Gap won't continue to expand and the old God won't come down right it keeps wanting to oppose me like this is there really no other choice y Wu was deep in thought when suddenly from behind a wolf lunged at him intending to attack Yu detected it turned around but couldn't react in time this is bad damn it it's that Feeling Again The Wolf can't sense the energy before it could strike y woo the wolf was sliced into pieces a voice echoed from a distance while dealing with the wolf I didn't expect to meet you here y woo standing still like that isn't a good habit you know hearing this y wo recognized the voice and wondered this voice is a man carrying a katana on his back appeared causing quite a stir I hope I didn't scare anyone huh it turned out to be senior and changen and Chang's sudden appearance was surprising is everyone okay being ambushed by beasts from behind is very dangerous Mio y rushed over to him and Chang is it really you seeing this Yu thought whether it's really dangerous or not is still uncertain showing up at this time isn't he afraid of being suspected y Wu turn to think and chain it seems you've saved my life thank you senior saou then chined in you don't need to be so modest y woo it's just a wolf what could it do to you and chain saou immediately showed an annoyed expression towards enang he is the Red Man Of The Hang Jen group not staying put in the team frequently wandering around area 9 moreover we just broke the formation and he appeared right away youu seeing this couldn't dismiss her saiou as expected from the underworld you seem to know quite a lot already saou then named her gun directly at in Chang's head it's very hard not to raise suspicion what exactly you want do mea seeing this panicked sister saou what are you doing and Chang has no ill intentions I can sense it and Chang quickly reassured SAU with some flattering words sister saou is still as agile as before although my superiors have some conflicts it's not hostile between us can you put the gun down down first let's talk things over slowly Yu also stepped in to defend that's right the formidable enemy is right in front of us let's set aside past disagreements and deal with the current trouble first moreover with senior and Chang joining us our combat strength will increase won't it on the surface he seemed friendly yet ywo was quite scheming you bumped into him on your own senior you're definitely The Hired Hand so you should first show Good Will towards him then slowly trick him I don't believe you won't reveal your secrets saou finally calmed down but still have her doubts I will give face to Y woo but that doesn't mean I don't suspect you be honest with me and Chang appeared worried spare me saou yiu noticed this and reassured him there's no need to take it too seriously senior saou just has a habit of being cautious she doesn't mean to Target you you're just misunderstanding seeing this and Chang felt somewhat relieved and smiled again indeed it was a misunderstanding I stayed in zone 9 for a few New Missions I was just helping civilians disperse earlier when I heard the explosion and came over to see what was happening y Wu thought the explanation was quite reasonable and Chang and yiu both looked up at the Blood Red Sky Full of Thunder it's because we just destroyed a sumon formation but there are other formations still in existence and Chang grasps some information about the current situation so that's it I had noticed the abnormalities in the sky before so what are we waiting for y Wu then spoke seriously this is not an easy matter do you wish to participate senior and Chang responded of course this area is my hometown it's filled with my beautiful memories I can't just stand by and watch it be destroyed and Chang Dred his arm over Yu's shoulder and continued the way of speaking sounds very high IQ yiu replied the way of speaking has low IQ and Chen continued in the combat team accomplishing big things like this can provide a lot of benefits which will be very helpful for my promotion Yu responded calmly really but in his heart y Wu meticulously scrutinized every action and gesture of anchang and Chang's current demeanor had no flaws at all Mio y felt guilty for not being able to help much she looked at her teammates and then SP poke shall we continue I'm Not Afraid miyya continued I just feel like I'm not able to contribute anything I'm just a burden to everyone seeing this Yi Wu immediately comforted her that's not true at all thanks to your secret magic circle ability we were able to find this hidden formation your ability is very important saou also came over hugged me ya yaah and said a few comforting words that's right your ability is much more useful than mine cheer up let's handle the remaining formations and then we can go find your parents hearing this moo y felt somewhat reassured okay okay as long as everyone keeps me in check I will do my best to help everyone y Wu smiled how could we ever look down on you we can't do without each other not even one person and Chang said looking at his teammates the fastest way to deal with the remaining formations everyone agreed with Mia's opinion they replied all right run as fast as you can to find another formation to destroy while running and Chang ask y wo share some intelligence from before so I can be prepared Yi Wu immediately responded okay let's talk while we run and Chang soon spotted the second formation I've found the second formation now the question is how to disrupt this protective barrier seeing that Yu said I haven't used the method from before yet this time do you have any ideas senior because this formation is a product of the Huang Jen group and Chang was astonished to hear this is that so so you are suspecting that the Hang Jen group is in cahoots with this cult saou leaning against the wall spoke in a grave tone who knows you're the Red Man of Wong Jang no more than us explain or just make up a story hearing that and chain tried hard to explain spare me sister I you what kind of confident I'm just just a runner for errands but your suspicion is very reasonable anyway the current situation is very difficult to explain clearly and Chang can only say I can only say that so far the Huang Jen group does not discriminate when it comes to business selling weapons to anyone is not important as long as money can be made therefore with the situation like this it really can't be clearly defined hu seeing this also spoke up to support and chain that's right I truck senior 100 % but I advise you to act practically to prove yourself you don't want sister saou always targeting you do you and Chang seemed to have figured out how to dispel this suspicion he understood disrupting the formation can prove my innocence and Chang side who told me to always care about issues of Injustice it really is painful and Chang immediately threw out the overload generator confidential model luckily I brought this otherwise I wouldn't be able to clarify things then that device flew toward the formation aiming to disrupt the energy cover for them everyone was excited and immediately shabed your Gadget is amazing disrupting that energy cover is so easy and Chang quickly rushed through confidently cutting down those people of course because the trust of the small ship is not something that can be overturned easily Mio ya looked surprised and said oh could it be that enang has killed them all SAU seeing this replied it's just a knockout and Chang hearing this happily responded aloh hang Jang did not choose a monopoly to avoid issues he wants to use weapons produced by himself and will sell weapon tools through the back door the tool I just used was to sabotage the defense section it seems that enang has a bit of confidence in everyone he continued there you go I've revealed all the secrets like this so everyone trusts me now right suddenly a stroke of light flashed strike directly at the red magic Crystal Yi Wu destroyed it excitedly Yi Wu said senior you even forgot about the most important Blood Demon Crystal y Wu then approached and Chang and continued if the Blood Demon Crystal isn't destroyed we cannot completely seal the open space and Chang was flustered is that so I see why didn't you say it sooner Yu placed a hand on inchang shoulder and smiled no problem with you here what is there to worry about the work efficiency is very high this time saou has nothing more to say you truly deserve to be a legend of the academy Simply the Best and chain just replied you're overstating it you're overstating it after that Yu cheerfully said to everyone come on we should head to the next point now and Chang was still in shock faking to himself the speed of that sword was really fast I didn't even have time to react if that sword had come at me what was it trying to convey it seems my junior isn't as harmless as they appear after a while everyone finally arrived at their destination and Chang went up and said this is the final magic Crystal everyone step back so I can strike it Mio yaah happily exclaimed great once this is destroyed that big guy up in the sky won't be able to come out anymore meanwhile you Mo felt puzzled everything seemed a bit strange he thought everything is going too smoothly except for the protective barrier there's not even a second line of defense the cold worlds King's Landing Club can't be that Nave right a few seconds later the magic Crystal blasted them away causing everyone to panic what just happened then the magic Crystal fused them together and a voice rang out ah it's the Divine calling me hahahaha I will become one with the god the Magnificent God power I can feel the endless power ye wo raised his voice they have been merged with the magic Crystal then he turned to everyone and said steady yourselves prepare to fight the enemy this is likely the final maneuver of the cold world Kings Landing club now unleash your skills after incorporating the group The Magic Crystal gradually transformed into a monster or could also be called The Blood Demon crystal in human form it said you're just insignificant beings how dare you dream of stopping The Descent of the god kill all who disrespect the divine everyone Must Die Another face appeared on the body of the Blood Demon Crystal and it said who I have sinned I cannot allow the god to descend please punish me and Ching said stay behind me I will take on the Vengeance Mio yah add some healing to me y Wu and SAU lend your strength y Wu stood in front suddenly realizing wait the level difference is too great this strategy before he could finish speaking The Blood Demon Crystal charged forward and attacked you insignificant humans dared to conspire against the replacement of the god arrogant and Chang took a significant hit to block its attack losing a considerable amount of Health in just one strike his health had dropped to 60% this is the terror of a rare beast at level 60 after a period of resistance the monster eventually knocked him away disdainfully saying so trivial it then quickly shifted its focus toou y wo quickly rushed to hug saou using his shield to block an attack for her sister at saou be careful don't just stand there hold your weapon tightly and watch out for dodging the speed of this guy's attacks isn't very fast saou felt embarrassed in y wo's Embrace saying sorry Yoo The Shield energy of yours continuously decreases over time YW thought to himself although its attack speed isn't fast the power is excessively abnormal fundamentally at a different level than the Beast I encountered before my 10 layers of energy were instantly broken damn it at this moment y Wood's Health had dropped to 85% he silently told himself to break 10 layers of Shield energy and still have that kind of attack power the next attack knocked Yi Wu and SAU back quite a distance Yi Wu thought I can't just keep withstanding its attacks like this anymore otherwise even my innate defense won't be able to withstand several skills a few seconds later an Chang stepped forward swinging his sword directly at the Blood Demon Crystal figure he thought I must turn defense into a fence to have any chance of winning based on my experience of surpassing 20 levels as long as I'm not hit I'll have a chance to retaliate until it's dead however Yu's strike only caused it to lose 5% Health he thought to himself it must be too tough a full-powered innate attack of mine only causing such minor damage saou yelled in panic quick Retreat y woo the defense power of this Beast is too abnormal we simply can't break through the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal heard this and said running away will not earn the Forgiveness of the god and Chang struggling to dodge the attacks realized it must be the magic Crystal hidden on its body that grants it such high defense a device was thrown in front of the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal the face is on its body began to stir then a voice rang out what is this all the devious tricks before me are nothing at all the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal continued speaking God please forgive these deceitful and weak people a shield appeared restraining the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal and Chang shouted everyone hurry and run my level 55 force field can trap it here for a while just leave it to me the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal was struggling to break through the Shield it angrily said trap me are you joking God please punish these arrogant and weak people at this moment yiu said to en Chang your weapons are all broken are you going to go in empty-handed to face this sword take it and Chang reached out to take the sword puzzled what is this sword Yu replied this is electric and Optical dual power it has lightning effects and attacks can Shi from one-handed to two-handed with a third % increase in attack speed just take it and use it but this time escaping is the best choice the important thing is the senior can't hold on for much longer Yu continued while it's trapped for a while finding its weaknesses and formulating a new strategy is the best option and Chang looked at ywu with concern in such a life and death situation you can still think calmly his combat experience is undoubtedly richer than mine at this moment Mio raised her hand to her head looking tired as she said I think I found its weakness but my head hurts everyone was then very surprised and delighted well done moow yaa you always bring me surprises what is its weakness miow yaa said with difficulty I feel that the magic power in the boss's body seems to be channeling the magic Crystal on its back the Blood Demon Crystal figure immediately dismissed moya's words nonsense the God will have no weaknesses everyone also realized if that is the case there truly is something there like a heartbeat but the Crux of the matter is how can we smash the Blood Demon Crystal that is so hard yiu turned to ask what do you think about the weakness scan the scan replied Master comprehensive analysis shows that we can only use the previous Blood Demon Crystal to enhance weapons leveraging the similar properties to destroy its hardness y Wu also figured out tit fortat paying attention or immediately experiment a bit Yu turned at saou saou can I borrow your gun for a bit saou though puzzled still handed it to him H what are you going to do with the gun you take it Yi Wu took the gun and said I will help you enhance it modify the weapon a bit and fuse it with the Blood Demon Crystal enhancement saiou was astonished what you know that skill too a few seconds later after completing the task the system displayed a notification bloodthirsty windchaser is an attack with blood sucking effects armor-piercing effectivess attack speed increased by 30% saou exclaimed is there really that many special effects y Woo you're impressive after a while the Blood Demon crystal in humanoid form broke through the shield the game is over this barrier has wasted so much of my time Yu said saou quick try the effect right away saou replied leave it to me she continuously fired multiple streams of bullets at the Blood Demon Crystal making it struggle ouch it hurts so much damn it how can this be the Blood Demon Crystal yelled you've broken through my defense again its Health quickly decreased stopping at 90% And Chang exclaimed it's stiff now it's effective how did you manage that Yu Yu immediately replied although the damage isn't high at most it can only be temporarily controlled if if we want to defeat it we need a weapon with power but right now where can we find that and Chang happily said I have one previously with going to the night market I helped the team buy some combat weapons but what do you want to do the system displayed and Chang wants to trade power gloves with you do you accept he was astonished what a coincidence at this moment The Blood Demon crystal in humanoid form was frustrated by sau's attacks I'm getting angry now this little bit of pain is really annoying y Wu quickly told in Chang not good the control Effectiveness has decreased senior think of a way to help me hold on for 20 seconds and Chang immediately ran over and handed Yu the notification system Master obtain power gloves yiu stepped back exchanged scans and used the shortest time to find out the item with growth amplitude linked to power gloves found it quickly master the power gloves are close combat weapons a traditional pair of gloves that wrap around both arms they can significantly enhance attack power and boost missile propulsion this small enhancement transformation item is used to accelerate upgrades for planes or cars and can greatly increase rotational size note private income of the principal this item left y Wu astonished damn it it's another disguise item I didn't expect the principal to like racing you can't judge a person by their appearance no time to talk quickly fuse and enhance these three items right away meanwhile the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal had knocked and Chang away these annoying ants die for me it roared and chenk blood was now only 10% no scanning speed my blood can't keep up anymore if this continues is Yu still not finished y wo quickly spoke up I've kept you waiting for too long a powerful attack struck down instantly shattering the sword of the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal what the hell is this my sword it cried in panic ye woo wearing power gloves said forcefully I've been holding back for a long time it's time for me to Counterattack the monster frightened screamed God please save me I'm scared God please save me I'm terrified another face of the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal darkened and roared your attack how could it suddenly become so strong you were able to smash my rigid magic Crystal yiu replied seriously suddenly strong do you think I would tell you the reason you rush at me aside from the experience points you have no value to me I have no intention of extracting any intelligence from you the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal continued to boast arrogantly I am the child of the heavens blessed by the old God how could a lowly being like you ever look down on me as long as I focus on on defense no one can breach it Yu ignored it and swung a punch at its body shut up gu Wu's punch shattered the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal into numerous magic crystals which screamed damn it y Wu quickly jumped back saying the blessing of the old God has no effect on my mind the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal refused to accept defeat shooting out unruly magic crystals how dare you disregard the old God and claim yourself as the new God you must accept the punishment 10,000 arrows piercing your heart at that moment everyone surged ahead and and Chang's voice rang out don't lose focus y woo we'll take care of the rescue you just focus on it y wuo was stunned everyone saou told him right now only you can destroy it don't waste your energy on such small matters and Chang added that's right give up on defense and pour all your strength into attacking it we're all counting on you hearing the words of his companions Yu quickly regained his composure then let's combine our efforts I want to finish this battle at the fastest speed yiu began to gather his strength unleashing maximum DPS just as y Wu prepared to thrust his fist forward he suddenly realized this is a level 60 God's realm energy value at 95% currently in recovery yiu was astonished looking at the magic power shield in front of him the Blood Demon crystal in human form laughed triumphantly you can use some tricks to break my rigid magic Crystal but you will absolutely not be able to breach my God's realm vaguely the warning alarm blared urgently warning warning Yi Wu was struggling hard using all his strength to strike at the annoying Shield he thought to himself as long as those two heads keep saying this magic barrier will keep replenishing energy damn it why is it that despite everything I've done my strength is still not enough obscurely the systems warning echoed again warning continuous overload attacks will result in an overload State update notification God's realm level 60 energy value 50% recovering The Blood Demon crystal in human form excitedly said haha useless I have been blessed by the gods no one can breach my defense ye woo having exerted too much effort was knocked back he gritted his teeth blaming himself damn it why didn't I aim for his left heart from the very beginning again the notification sounded the Master's attack has exceeded the limit of strength attributes entering an overload State life value is continuously decreasing time remaining 30 seconds The Blood Demon crystal in the form of a cheerful person laughed and said haha I love seeing others suffer it's so much fun my defense is even praised by the freest you foolish Mortals how can you ever break through it the Arrogant Beast shouted defiantly I'm here to see who dies first ha the system notification echoed warning warning due to overload status the host blood volume is continuously decreasing a large amount of energy within y wo began to Glow trying to heal his wounds he thought to himself the freest is his superior but this information is no longer important what's important is breaking through his defense if not don't even mention stopping the old God from descending I'm afraid we all might die here Yu clenched his fists determined I must use absolute power to suppress his magic barrier and stop his recovery rate thinking of this Yi Wu quickly ordered the AI robot viz scan and check if I have any power enhancing items left hurry the robot replied helplessly sorry Master there really isn't any even a basic strength potion is not available Yu did not pay attention to VI's response but focused his thoughts a strength potion that's right there's another path ye woo asked again does anyone have strength potions lend me a vile quick Mi yya startled by Yu's sudden question replied strength potions and chain shook his head and regret sorry I don't have any I bought a lot of things before but I didn't buy strength potions me also chimed in I don't have any either I only have intellectual potions do you need those standing beside them saou was silent and deep in thought seeing her pensive expression Yi Wu immediately pressed on do you have any potions if you do hurry up and give them to me if it's money just put it on credit I'll pay you back later sau's face darkened at Yu's words she quickly threw the potion vial towards him and shouted I've told you already we all need to talk about money between us Yi Wu caught the vial and as he listened to sa you add the reason I don't want to give it to you is because of its side effects yiu was puzzled and opened the system to check the information about the vial on the screen it read Hercules power potion after use strength attributes increase by 300% for 1 minute when the effect wears off it comes with two hours in a weaken State and no tricks can be used to eliminate it Yu exclaimed 2 hours in a weakened State this is indeed a very fatal side effect saou anxiously looked at Yu and said aren't you supposed to go save your family once you fall into a weaked state how can you before saou could finish her sentence she saw y wo silently drank the entire vial of medicine sweat poured down her face like rain and she asked in fear hey did you hear what I said why are you not hesitating y Yi Wu calmly wiped his mouth and replied we'll deal with that later if I can't even overcome the current difficult challenge then what can I say about the future besides aren't there still people here my family suddenly yiwu's eyes widened his pupils constricted sharply he jumped up shouting loudly ah the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal seeing Yu's Sudden Change stared at him in Surprise what's happening to this person suddenly Yu charged at the Beast throwing a punch at it causing it to cry out in pain damn it before it could grasp what was happening Yu began to beat it relentlessly he alternated between punches and kicks attacking continuously the humanoid Blood Demon Crystal was tortured by Yu's blows continuously crying out in pain Yu's blood index is currently at only 21% everyone standing outside watches him frantically beat the beast in astonishment seu speaks up his attack power is so strong but the way he fights disregards the consequences and chain quickly instructs May yaa make sure to keep an eye on Yu's blood level Mia replies anxiously but Yu's blood is draining too fast I won't be able to keep up she has been trying desperately to heal his wounds to recover his blood but it's proving ineffective The Blood Demon crystal in human form is being relentlessly attacked by him caught off guard and internally anxious thinking this person's attack pattern has been increasing exponentially the healing speed of the shield won't be able to keep up for long but his life value is also running low just a precise opportunity could break his defense and deal him a fatal blow the Victor will be before the thought could finish yiu shatters the last line of defense The Blood Demon crystal is terrified sensing the defense cracking and on the verge of collapse when The Shield is completely broken its body becomes so fragile that even a single punch from ywu causes it to lose a part of it its body the Beast groaned in agony crying out no no how could this be my heart why I clearly accepted the blessing of the god before the Blood Demon crystals human form exploded it went insane laughing maniacally haah don't think that just because you've defeated me you could stop The Descent of the old God the cold world King's Landing Club will never be destroyed you have already been monitored by us your family your friends they will all die a gruesome death yiu held its heart in his hand stuffing it into his mouth but immediately sensed something am Miss not good he wants to self-destruct Yi Wu quickly crushed the Beast heart gritting his teeth in response then I will annihilate the cold world King's Landing Club The Blood Demon Crystal could only utter you the upper half of its body exploded along with its heart and Y wo immediately collapsed alongside it he lay there gasping for breath hearing everyone joyfully cheer vwo you won well done system notification you have killed the Beast Blood Demon crystal in human form earned 200,000 experience points 50,000 Yuan you have obtain the enhancement materials the magic Crystal level 60 skill book Gods realm summon demon Crystal New Gods call the system continued to announce the host is entering a weeken state the countdown of two hours begins Yu lay still thinking it's finally over but what should I do next I can only rely on those three but the feeling of entrusting my life to someone else yiu gritted his teeth and tried to get up he was startled to see inang swinging his sword staring intently at him Yu spoke first and chain senior at that moment SAU and me yay quickly rushed out standing in front of Yi Wu SAU raised his gun pointing directly at and Chang shouting and Chang what do you want to do has the fox tail finally shown itself Mio yaah weapon ready in hand looked seriously at anchang and Chang brother what's wrong with you y Wu is our friend you are not allowed to harm him and Chang ignored the two in front of him his vicious gaze fixed firmly on yiu he forcefully thrust his sword into the ground creating a long and deep line hurriedly he said what are you guys doing and Chang raised both hands looking confused at saou and meya sister at saou miow yaa don't Point weapons at me it's just a misunderstanding I was just distracted you all don't need to react like this sa you kept the gun pointed at in Chang frowning and saying do you think you're so smart or do you think I'm stupid do you really think I would believe this nonsense and Chang hurriedly replied didn't we just go through a life and death situation together he scratched his head looking embarrassed why do people still doubt me just now I was only taken aback by Yu's strength I absolutely mean no harm and moreover M yaa looked at anchang with a wary expression and Chang glanced at saou and murmured if I really wanted to kill you do you think two beauties could stop me upon hearing this saou instinctively felt scared beads of sweat forming and Chang approached Yu who was sitting down and bent down to help him up y woo let me carry you you're in a weaken State you can't afford to act recklessly Yi wo petly refused no need senior I can still manage to walk just helping me hold one arm is enough Mio yel looked at y woo both amazed and admiring V Woo you're really impressive it's unbelievable that a normal person in a weaken State can maintain their composure enough to lie down and you can still stand up and walk it's truly incred inedible SAU stood silently observing them Yi Wu being supported by anchang quickly said it's just a usual operation no need to be astonished sa you young lady doesn't need to be too straightforward like that and changen Senior and we are all survivors we're closer now so let's reduce suspicion and add a bit of trust and Chang laughed heartily haha that's right it's still about learning to understand me at this moment suddenly the robot I Vis appeared appeared leading close to Yu's ear and Whispering the Spectrum on this person's body is indeed filled with black killing intent but this killing intent is not clear therefore it cannot be determined whether this killing intent is due to the previous master or directed towards you Yu glanced at this thinking to himself in any case and Chang Senor indeed has many suspicious points but until there is clear evidence I still need to keep him close as a safeguard regardless of his motives War Secrets before he turns hostile we can still cooperate joyfully and Chang helped Yu sit down on a rock and then suggested let's rest for 5 minutes then how about we set off yiu nodded this suggestion is not bad in the sky light has appeared again everyone quickly looked up and saou and moow yaa huged each other joyfully moow yay pointed at the sky happily saying great finally we have successfully prevented The Descent of the old God the greatest threat has been eliminated saou excitedly replied that's right Yu looked at them coldly and said don't be careless although the rift in space is closed the danger of many beasts invading has not yet been eliminated we must remain Vigilant at all times since my little life is in your hands after saying that he lay down on a rock letting his Spirit drift and recovering his health Mi y worriedly said do your best ye woo suddenly Yu sat up looking at saou and said oh right all the Blood Demon crystals have been destroyed the communication device might have been restored now saou understood the hint and immediately responded I will try to contact the young lady right away y w lay down again to rest at that moment the system announced moai requests to transmit information to you he sat up looked at the screen in front of him and said I think it's not needed anymore your young lady has already proactively contacted me saou looked over at him in Surprise and asked what she was astonished to see the two of them talking to each other through the intercom after having recovered the first person that the young lady contacted back is Yu in the young lady's heart is he that important Yu sat in front of the screen focused on responding yes it's me the situation on our and is saou looked at yiu pursed her lips feeling the complex mix of emotions inside she wondered am I feeling jealous or envious at the same time in another place m n stood with her arms crossed looking at the screen in front of her beside her were two bodyguards she coldly said I know now Wong Jang and the nine cold world Kings Landing Club interesting right now I am very safe I have contacted the rescue team it will just take some time everyone stay still I will head over there right away hearing this you woo quickly intervened no need to come here to improve efficiency we are near the connecting Bridge let's meet at the secret passage in area number eight I will send you the coordinates right away Moi May quickly agreed coordinates are fine let's meet there in her heart she thought he knows even about this secret channel it's not simple he truly lives up to my expectations Yu sat in front of the screen tense and sweating as he listened to her he worriedly asked are you really okay with your weaken State remember you are the talent that the young lady has her eye on don't let something small get you stranded he replied perfunctorily yeah thanks for your concern I'm fine and Chang leaned in from behind and whispered I heard before that you with Miss Mo had an unusual relationship I thought it was a joke today I see the rumors are true it's really impressive Yi Wu glanced at him unfeelingly replied is that so and Chang helped y woo up talking as they walked but it's true with this young lady backing you I feel a bit reluctant to put an effort Yu was startled and asked back really and Chang nodded yeah I'm seriously considering it sa you and meow ya follow behind seeing the men chatting like this felt a bit disdainful said yeah men ha at safe Zone number nine the connecting Bridge was bustling with people there were many trucks carrying goods and everyone was pushing and shoving anxious and shouting let us in open the door why do you see people dying and not save them a loudspeaker announced soothingly please do not get angry we are still waiting for orders from above of course this response did not make people feel any better everyone shouted loudly waiting for what the beasts are already hot on our heels quickly open the door in the secret passageway heading towards Zone number eight Wang Jang go stood with his hands on his hips looking at the yiu family surprised as he said indeed that connecting Bridge can no longer be excessed the screams of the civilians are so loud that we can still hear them here can he predict this Yu's mother looked into the distance anxiously saying why hasn't y Wu arrived yet I am so worried about him Yun Fe sitting next to her hurried to comfort her don't worry Mom he just contacted us he will be here soon he so capable there's definitely nothing wrong Nana sitting behind pointed in the opposite direction and shouted ah it's the master gu woo in the group arrived safely at the Gathering Place he joyfully shouted Dad Mom yanf everyone was startled and looked towards wooer deep yanf quickly ran to Y Wu hugged him and said brother I'm so glad you're okay I was so worried about you Yu hugged his sister laughing Happ happily aren't I here now haha Yu's mother also rushed over hugged her son and worriedly asked wooer why you look so Haggard are you feeling unwell anywhere Yu's grandmother embraced the whole family said our family can still reunite truly Misfortune there is Good Fortune yiu smiled in the Embrace of his family and replied Mom I'm fine just a little weak a bit of rest will do Nana stood by watching the family re iion also moved to tears it's so good that the whole family can reunite Master though saying that she thought differently in her heart the feelings of lowly creatures are indeed disgusting I'm almost nauseated yiu bent down to P her head and praised her this time nana has also worked hard thanks to you my whole family is safe and sound she stood obediently watching him smiling and said for my master Nana can do anything in Yu's mind there was a different concern right now he is very weak killing him would be as easy as turning over a hand but his body still does not follow his true will and acts on its own he tells himself I must find a way to escape this constraint a voice interrupted from behind I'm sorry to disturb the reunion of your family Yu turned his gaze back and Nana stared in surprise at moai and the two body guards moai spoke up but now there is no time to indulge in happiness anymore because the champion leader of the Beast has invaded this time different AEL has manifested moai calmly continued due to the manifestation of different a cow the Beast has become very stable it shows no tendency to continue encroaching on area number eight therefore if this continues area number nine will directly turn into a replica World humans can no longer stay here everyone must leave immediately yiu gritted his teeth in anger and said the replica world so it means they want to seize this place to make it a refuge right his clenched hand shook with anger and then you grew up in front of her such unreasonable behavior he wondered what does the Beast really want to do moii crossed her arms standing and watching y woo saying they're just a group of beasts irrational behavior is what's abnormal what we should be concerned about is that the boss has reached level 90 yiu was shocked level 90 are you sure a boss at this level is no joke duvu hugged her mother tightly worried facing a level 90 boss even a professional teen would find it very difficult to win saou was also anxious and wanted to confirm again I don't want doubt your judgment young lady but is the source of this information reliable after all this is hard to believe m n did not look at them saying it's absolutely reliable after all I saw it with my own eyes everyone was was surprised to hear that exclaiming what you saw the boss directly mokai calmly replied yes although it was only from afar she recalled the moment she saw the giant Beast with a terrifying appearance the upper part was a bull's head while the lower part resembled a large bird she remembered the terrifying face along with its bright purple eyes continuing but it nearly killed me with a direct glance if it hadn't been for the two guards risking their lives to create a shield to protect me then young lady be careful we've been detected while it hasn't attacked here yet let's quickly Retreat thinking about this Mo trembled all over feeling dizzy and light-headed to the point that she had to raise her hand to support herself then she said clearly we are so far apart yet just a glance almost took my life although I'm not afraid of even dying the terrifying feeling that comes from deep within the soul is what frightens me from beginning to end it has been a haunting seeing her shivering with fear yiu approached her and patted her shoulder to comfort her perhaps you've been affected by its harmful effect there's no need to be scared surviving its attack is already impressive moai looked at him her face blushing from the compliment and said why woo did you see the two bodyguards standing behind moai raised her thumb towards her own position naturally sweating on her forehead contemplating various thoughts couldn't be be that you all have misunderstood something mokai steadied herself crossed her arms and spoke proudly all right I'm not a girl who needs Comfort let's top business first of all I have worked with HMO group to study the structure to connect with the Beast and confirm that this boss belongs to one of the 28 artifacts everyone began to murmur and discuss 28 artifacts what is this concept it's the first time I've heard of it m n continued since the era of Al opened on Earth everything in the world has mutated and beasts are no exception Scholars have studied for many years and discovered that the power levels of beasts are organized according to a certain rule this rule just happens to align with King long Swan wo suzaku and white tiger the four elephants the four elephants and the Seven constellations form the 28 constellations she further explained in layman's terms within this group of beasts there are a total of 28 boss monsters it is normal that you have not heard of them because this information has not spread to the Common People bashing a cow is one of the four elephants King long through M's detailed account the image and power of the Beast grew clearer in everyone's mind throughout the history of different AO it has slaughtered dozens of low-level cities although some have organized teams to eradicate it they ultimately failed Yi Wu coldly remarked that's because in the past there were no interests from large L corporations only smallscale eradication teams thus it was inevitable they would be wiped out but with the current situation if you sit back and do nothing it will sooner or later affect your large corporations you can't just remain idle and ignore it m quickly replied of course hanm Mo group has dispatched elate teams to form a combat Squad the replica will arrive shortly moreover according to Reliable information other large corporations are also Gathering the battle teams to prepare for the first kill she looked towards andang standing behind and said including Wang Jen from your group and Chang seeing her point at him like that hurriedly scratched his head in embarrassment and said haha that's for sure the young ladies up there place so much importance on that first kill even more than their own lives who knows they might have set off already Yu looked at them and asked this battle is indeed beyond my expectations having so many corporate battle teams fighting fiercely could it be that this boss has dropped something valuable for example a low-level legendary equipment artifact Moi quickly explained you guessed it right similar to the bosses at the 28 constellations level they all have their own domains as long as someone achieves the first kill they can obtain the key and open the large door of the domain inside the domain are various rare resources they have collected the amount of resources is equivalent to five five times that of a replica of the same level if converted to money stopping for a moment she raised two fingers her face glowing as she said at least 2 billion Yu heard the amount that could be gained from defeating the Beast his eyes shining as he thought 2 billion even though he was still in a weakened State he thought why not give it a try and Chang stepped closer to Yu asking intimately so what do you think Junior that's a level 90 boss you can't be hiding any tricks can you Yi Wu felt sweat pouring out more as he heard him ask such questions turning his face away he said oh how could that be in his mind he calculated a copy of a level 90 boss was already far beyond my capabilities unless I used experience points to directly unlock an entirely new account what if I ended up with a powerful account yiu frowned and thought whether it's worth it or not can be discussed later at least there's some chance of success m included the matter all right let's temporarily withdraw from area number eight and think things over the remaining civilians will naturally be rescued once the team eliminates the boss y Wu nodded in agreement guide wi Jen approached y Wu and asked vwoo I have something I want asked the coordinates of this tunnel are a secret known only to our security team how did you know Yu replied honestly a female staff member from the security team told me it's it seems she is also a member of tan chuang group like some of you Shen Bing upon hearing y woo hurriedly ran to grab his shoulders anxiously asking is her name kin Ru where is she now do you know what happened to her why Jango shouted calm down Shen bang ye we said she he saw the photo of the two of them together he looked at the young man in front of him thinking did they have that kind of relationship thinking this ye leaned in and whispered to Shen Bing she sacrificed herself to help me escape and was killed by a beast at the last moment she gave me these coordinates she was a good person Shen bang upon hearing this cried out in despair how could this be kin Ru is dead dead W jongo seeing him in a state of frenzy quickly held him back loudly stating you fool control your emotions at least she is not a Defector her sacrifice was not invent Shen Bing covered his face trembling with tears but she's already dead she's basically of no value anymore seeing them like this Yu's face grew even colder he's silently resolved he doesn't speak incorrectly in this era the only standard to measure political value is survival I'm sorry I can only help you this far I hope this kind-hearted lie can comfort you a bit yanf was walking ahead completely unaware of what was happening behind her she cheerfully pointed towards the gate there's light it seems big brother is about to reach the exit after passing through the gate she looked around in surprise huh why is the atmosphere behind so heavy in the distance a voice echoed stop right there a silver-haired man one side of his face covered by black fabric stood with four others behind him each armed they looked at her fiercely the man at the front shouted this mountain is opened by me this tree is planted by me if you want to pass through here pay up Yu hurriedly ran to yanf standing in front of his sister and asked who are you how do you know about this secret passage in his heart he thought my intuition tells me that these people are incredibly dangerous yanf stood behind him and reminded him their ranks are indeed high they are absolutely not ordinary people be careful the silver-haired man while puffing on a cigarette grinned wickedly and said a secret passage how could such a trivial matter pose a challenge for me after all I am a relic Hunter with experience from a 100 Battles I heard that area 9 was attacked by beasts so we came here to watch the fun waiting for so long without catching any business and the moment we arrive we come across a big fish don't you agree Miss Mo he pointed at Moi who asked you know me and yet you dare to rob in broad daylight it seems you are quite confident wait why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before which team's lineup are you from he replied I didn't expect to leave an impression on Miss Mo it's truly an honor for me the team is all in the past now I am a free-spirited Relic Hunter this time entering the safe Zone was to replenish equipment and it just so happened I ran into this situation coincidentally it's also a way to make some profit so everyone just needs to leave your wealth and equipment and you can pass through he continued I am a person with very strict principles I only want money not to take lives come here cooperate obediently and you'll have a way to survive moii upon hearing this stepped forward in front of him arms crossed arrogantly and said since the day I was born until now you've had many schemes to attack me but the outcomes for them were never good are you sure you want to continue he bent over and sinisterly replied what a coincidence since the day I was born until now I have never failed in what I wanted to do so of course I will continue m n took a step back and said then so be it immediately two bodyguards charged forward launching their skills towards him the old man with white hair blocked the punches from the two guards grinning proudly and said I've heard that next to miss Mo there are a pair of very strong twin bodyguards but these two strikes feel so weak I don't even need to use any strength to counter them but if this is all the power you have it really disappoints me as soon as he finished speaking he lifted the two guards like a spinning top causing m n to be extremely shocked how can this be two level 60s working together are being easily subdued by a level 65 y wo witnessing this pondered in confusion even if he is level 65 one person shouldn't be able to withstand the attacks of two level 60s let alone suppress them in an instant is this person really that strong I know the ability of these two bodyguards very well there must be some reason behind this he said wait a moment what is that disadvantageous effect could it be left behind by the level 90 Overlord suddenly he grabbed the heads of the two bodyguards lifting them off the ground in that instant his eyes gleaned with a terrifying intensity all attribute reductions by 40% duration last for an hour yiu seemed to have discovered the answer staring intently at him no wonder their skills are much weaker than usual this time it's a huge problem the white-haired old man tightened his grip on the two bodyguards heads his expression full of arrogance Miss Mo next I might just Crush their heads their lives are currently in my hands you are a smart person so you understand way the pros and cons right he paused for a moment emphasizing but I still remind you as a leader what is the most valuable thing at this moment talents especially those who live and die for you seeing this saou shouted loudly damn it let them go but moai seemed to have other considerations quickly stopping her don't be impulsive saou suddenly a red beam of light shapped straight at sau's forehead a cold voice echoed don't move the white-haired man's Ally gazing through the skoke said if you want to live it's best to listen to your master otherwise I'll make a hole right through that beautiful face of yours he then looked over at Wang jongo smirking with satisfaction the big guy over there should be obedient to me unless you want your head to turn into a cactus the level 55 fat guy beside him was eating and acting arrogant you guys should listen a bit after all you're just lowly beings if there's nothing else I'll continue eating another level 50 guy holding a book squinted and reminded keep it down don't disturb me while I'm reading Yu began to worry the aura and levels of these guys are completely different from The Relic Hunters I've met in the Night Market not only are they powerful but their coordination is also very seamless my weakened state only has 30 minutes left he thought to himself but even if I recover without strong allies I won't be able to win the most important thing is that the 2 million just landed in my hands and before I could even warm it up it's already Out Of Reach damn it Moi n saw that the situation was not not good and wanted to mediate money means nothing to me I still have 80 million on me I can give it all to you let my subord go as for the others you shouldn't dream either the total amount on you all combined isn't even enough to cover my spare change hearing this he immediately released the two bodyguards smugly saying no wonder she's the young lady of the HMO group she's really generous he said but I fear you will mock me he contemptuously remarked even flies and maggots are still meat it is not easy to reach a safe zone so of course we must seize everything we can after all in this desolate place without power having no money is also useless the old man turned to his subordinates strip everything from these people for me leave no one out hearing the order the subordinates immediately complied suddenly a hand gently rested on moi's shoulder she was cautious and softly said to them you don't need to waste your effort just come at me I'll surrender willingly she turned around looking at Yu he looked at her firmly and said thank you for protecting us with our current team's strength we shouldn't provoke them otherwise the consequences could be unimaginable even so Yi Wu was inwardly distressed telling himself I'm the most money conscious person but for the bigger picture I have to endure he looked at her with disdain I didn't expect a proud young lady like you to stand up for these commers that's a bit surprising one of the subordinates chimed in but what good does it do just hand it over to me voluntarily otherwise if I have to take action you might suffer greatly the man beside him agreed laughing heartily that's right the boss has decided we're striking it rich this time I didn't expect these people to look poor but in reality they have quite a fortune he laughed triumphantly haha this time I appreciate your hospitality haha I will definitely keep my promise let's go the group of subordinates around him chuckled nonsensically boss oan fell asleep again while reading I truly admire him every time he reads he falls asleep yet he still loves to read and Chang seeing someone feeling hopeless and disappointed comforted him cheer up y woo money is just an external object the most important thing is that life is still intact YW thought to him self I don't need your consolation this is a physiological response unrelated to logic suddenly moai said I think I remember who he is he is a subordinate of Wang Jen group from the emperor team the old man with white hair upon hearing this smiled and admitted oh if Miss Mo remembers I won't hide it anymore that's right I am grey wolf reol from the emperor team and Chang turned red with anger upon hearing that name grey wolf renol re waved his hand while walking forward and said all right I've mentioned my name to you in the future if hanmo group Wants Revenge just come find me rol will always be here in this Wasteland welcoming you at any time suddenly a loud shout rang out stop immediately after a sharp slash tore through the air severing a level 50 subordinate of Rea he shouted angrily F sing Who damn it who dares to ambush my junior like this senior and Chang brimming with killing intent coldly said so you are grey wolf reol I've been searching for you for 5 years I didn't expect to encounter you here reol shouted furiously damn it who are you that sword in your hand what is it not human more ghost I will send you to meet the reaper ywu saw and Chang like this and was taken aback not only had his arms elongated like the sword of his race but the've o possessed a skill capable of killing a level 50 opponent indeed you are hiding your strength senior but what on Earth is this form of yours could it be as I think and Chang yelled I never expected to find you in a situation like this truly fate is Playing Tricks grey wolf reol I have been looking for you for 5 years for one reason reol confused and Furious looked at him damn it who are you why don't you kneel obediently on the ground and dare to kill my brothers after killing him now you want to kill others I will make sure you all die alongside my brother immediately renold's henchmen shielded him firing their weapons towards enang understood boss I will definitely tear you apart into a 100 pieces and avenge sing en Chang rushed forward using the bulletproof Shield fighting with a fierce spirit this is a grudge between us it has nothing to do with others you all will die sooner or later don't use others to threaten me the fat man hearing this charged straight at in chain and slammed his belly with a blow damn it stop being so proud you think you can kill the four of us all by yourself are you dreaming reol shouted don't waste time talking to him in my entire life I have grudges with many people but I uniquely don't remember having any grudge against you kill him my comrades upon hearing the order the henchmen immediately surged with spe it yes boss renold yelled furiously damn it dare to sneak attack me do you think you can live long like this from within the smoke and Chang stepped out his voice calm Annie do you remember this name she used to be your subordinate renol was astonished muttering damn it this kid isn't injured at all how could that be Annie of course I remember she was the main force of the grey wolf team when I was still in the squad but later during a mission she embezzled the assets of my team and then vanished Without a Trace reyal snarled angrily she is a treacherous War who betrayed the team and caused me to be expelled from the emperor team losing my bright future damn it just thinking about it makes me Furious and Chang could no longer bear it yelling loudly as he charged forward shut up my sister is absolutely not that kind of person reol smirked replying sister ha so you're that girl's little brother no wonder you look familiar team charge in and kill him to pay off her debt rol's underlings rushed in shouting leave it to me I just woke up full of energy another warned don't get too cocky this kid has some skills follow my orders and act at that moment and Chang transformed black wings sprouted from his back Long Claws appeared slashing down each of renault's henchmen he growled his eyes filled with killing intent debts must be repaid and you are the one who must pay this is your last chance reol was stunned stammering what my brothers who have fought alongside me through countless battles can be killed so easily who on Earth are you no that form of yours is not human are you some kind of New Breed just developed and Chang paid no mind shouting where is my sister hearing this rol roared in anger his body transforming into a powered up State energy surging around him damn it don't think you're the only one who could transform Rea nicknamed grey wolf roared grey wolf Rea is not an illusion do you think we fear you just because you've turned into a beast I've killed more beasts in this Wilderness than the amount of milk you've drunk and chain unfazed responded in a cold tone where is my sister speak or you will die reol Fury yelled go to hell and ask freak the two clashed and the fierce battle created a massive explosion forcing M's twin bodyguards to instantly create a shield to protect her carefully ensuring that this fight did not affect Outsiders yiu standing at a distance was also shaken and astonished the shock wave is too strong the level of this battle is far beyond the ones I participated in before even when using the enhancement drugs of the blood giant ye who couldn't help but worry damn it senior why did you expose yourself so soon this time even we don't have the chance to be friends anymore despite being severely injured and Chang refused to Back Down Standing Tall before reyal with unwavering eyes I ask you one last time where is my sister Ral after collapsing from too many wounds screamed with resentment why why do you have this power so suddenly why must one who has fought hundreds of battles like me die at the hands of a kid like you is there truly no fairness left in this world and Chang was Furious stamping his foot down on rea's face and coldly saying die rea's face turned purple he stammered a plea I'll tell you don't kill me I know where your sister is she must be in the depths of the canyon at that time I was obsessed with seizing the rare resources and equipment in the black star map I was planning to frame her but before I could do anything she disappeared it really has nothing to do with me alone she can't get out of that Canyon she must still be there please don't kill me but before he could finish his desperate please and Chang coldly and ruthlessly crushed ral's head standing nearby the old man Nana looked at this scene with disdain and coldly said ha a life upgraded to level 65 that was defeated by a low-level life how disgraceful y Yan Fe watched his face pale with fear as he witnessed and Chang in this state and Chang senior what have you become Yu attempted to call out senior and Chang gradually regained his awareness turned to yiu and said y Wu in this state of mind you're smart enough not to need any further explanation right Yu stepped forward his eyes full of questions but why why choose this path is there really no other way and Chang said wearily leave me alone please don't ask ask anymore this world is really very complicated everyone has their own secrets and wounds aren't you the same he looked at Yu his gaze filled with exhaustion and continued it's just a Pity that I don't have the Mystic powers like you I can only trade with them to gain strength y wo with a worried expression asked so what is the price is it related to the Beast Invasion this time and Chang sigh then looked into Yu's eyes and replied yes it was me who did it I helped them open a rift and in return they gave me the power to take my revenge it is a fair deal sometimes beasts are more reliable than humans the whole group was taken aback by this confession as in Chang was about to fly away Yun Fay stepped forward raising her Silver Bow and said in a harsh tone do you know how many people have lost their lives Because of You many happy families have been shattered because of you and now you act like nothing happened just brushing it off and moving on does your conscience hurt and Chan turned away coldly replied I'm sorry but I no longer have a conscience to me only she matters in this entire world she is the only thing I care about y Yun Fe was Furious and wanted to shoot but Yu stopped her he gently said Let It Go leten leave if he doesn't kill all of us we should at least be grateful to him gun Fe looked at her brother puzzled and asked brother y wo thank you senior for not killing us previously when I was weak you hesitated about whether or not to kill me if we count this time it has been the second time already right but matter is matter if you have chosen a different path next time we meet I absolutely will not hold back against you and Chang smiled faintly then flew away yiu watched him feeling grateful and said indeed nothing can be hidden from you ye woo yes I once wanted to kill you you because I admired you for having a happy family and great abilities as for why I didn't act even I don't really know I hope that in the future I won't regret this hesitation yiu gazed at en Chang's distant figure thinking that's because you and I are the same kind of person senior if I didn't have the king account system when my parents and Yun Fe were in danger probably to become stronger I would have chosen like you as well suddenly m n spoke up let's go in any case this matter has to be resolved the battle just now made too much noise there will likely be more issues arising then a voice called out wait a moment yiu said there is one very important thing I still haven't done MIM asked a very important thing what is it Yu stepped over to where a few soldiers were kneeling and grinned triumphantly of course it's to reclaim the money and Equipment they stole from us y Yuni witnessing his brother's eyes light up At The Mention Of Money shook his head helplessly you truly live up to being my brother Yu pondered reflecting this time there's a silver lining amidst The Misfortune if it weren't for en Chang's Outburst I would have almost gone bankrupt anyway let's put his matters aside for now the immediate issue is more critical the black tiger team provided me with great rewards last time I wonder how it will be this time the system notification echoed you have reclaimed your money in equipment Additionally you have gained 1,200 currency items not found in the wilderness a GT Shield device a blasting robot a phantom Slayer a phantom Terminator and a level 60 nanofiber ancient magic Crystal yiu was so happy he could cry thinking truly worthy of being a level 60 Relic Hunter both the money and Equipment are outstanding the system continued to announce congratulations Master you have earned reward WS for defeating experience points gained 100,000 yiu joyfully exclaimed this time I've made a huge profit thank you senior for being such a diligent worker everyone around could feel the change Nana excitedly said even I leveled up Yuni joyfully shouted oh my gosh I leveled up by 10 levels Am I Dreaming or what the story unfolds as ywu group Moi n and y Yan Fe are on their way to the coordinates of the rescue squad they have just earned a significant reward but they do not let that overshadow the difficult situation ahead Moy knife furrowed her brows showing her understanding and said they're just a bunch of average level 60 experts gaining so much experience isn't really surprising though y yanf was satisfied with the reward a complex sadness lingered in her heart she looked towards y wo her voice serious but when I think about it it's all thanks to senior and chain it really doesn't bring me joy I feel so confused inside Yu stepped closer gently patting her shoulder in Comfort don't think too much take care of yourself first at least we're still alive if you still have belief in Justice then become stronger the weak in corpses have no right to speak of Justice Yan F nodded then asked with curious eyes brother so what is your belief what drives you to want to become stronger hearing this y wo patted her head and smiled silly girl haven't you already know the answer M naai signaled to the group let's go not far ahead is the rescue squad's coordinates we need to hurry everyone responded in unison along the way the atmosphere grew tenser as they heard a shout from safe Zone number eight keep the main gate tight for me the refugees from Zone number n wouldn't let them in a soldier disagreed immediately but Captain are we really going to close the gates and watch others die without trying to save them there are so many lives out there the captain frowned tightened his grip on the young man's shirt and angrily scolded this is an order from above no one is allowed to defy it if you feel like a hero then I'll push you outside to protect the refugees yourself and confront those beasts the young man was taken aback unable to say anything the captain continued to issue orders what are you still doing standing there hurry up and go guard The City Gate for me if even one person gets in we are as good as dead the young man reluctantly complied responding softly yes Captain Yu watched from a distance feeling heavy-hearted as he thought it seems that Sector 8 has decided not to open the gates faced with the imminent Beast attack they are turning their guns on their own kind is this the selfishness of humanity or merely the depravity of human nature when confronted with life and death Moi me noticing Yu's pensive expression gently explained I understand what you're thinking but there are things that are deeply ingrained in the roots of this Society it's not as simple as wanting to change and being able to change instantly we can only learn to adapt to reality y wo nodded silently but doubt still linger in his heart Nana standing beside him side even in the face of life and death Humanity doesn't forget to fight amongst themselves truly a foolish race such suddenly in the sky missile planes landed Yu looked up confused what is this moai smiled lightly replied they have finally arrived this is the response team under hanmo group as soon as they landed the group of bodyguards stepped off the plane and immediately announced Target safety confirmed beginning Mission all unrelated Personnel please step back if not we will use Force immediately the team quickly formed a protective perimeter around securing the area suddenly one of the bodyguards aimed a gun at Yu's r m hurriedly intervened wait they are my guests let them come with us however The Bodyguard coldly replied our mission is only to ensure the safety of the young lady and protect the assets of the group others are beyond our directives we cannot disobey orders M angrily shouted this is my command do you dare to ignore it The Bodyguard calmly responded due to the specific situation we hope the young lady can understand The Bodyguard signaled to his teammates demanding take the young lady to the plane immediately one bodyguard promptly complied turning to M and saying young lady please follow us but just then M's twin bodyguards stood in front of The Bodyguard coldly shouting get lost The Bodyguard exclaimed what Someone Like You dares to stop us do not be rude suddenly a voice rang out young lady I have come to pick you up do not act so arrogantly come with us the one who spoke was sliver slow level 85 from the ink attack team M saw her and wondered sliver slow I didn't expect the first person to come pick me up to be you are you planning to take action against me here sliver slow covered her mouth chuckling softly sliver slow wouldn't dare surely young lady has misunderstood haha well we should set off quickly the chairman and young Master are very worried about you upon hearing this moai insisted I have already said they are my guests and must accompany me sliver slow appeared cunning replying I'm afraid you no longer have any Authority not long ago the chairman passed a new resolution to reduce the losses of the corporation and protect the company's assets they have downgraded your authority to that of a regular director now you must follow all Arrangements of the team everyone was a astonished upon hearing this mokai calmly said what they did is quite normal ywu thought the chairman and the young Master are limiting M's power the internal grudges within the noble family are clearly visible now if that's the case M lowered her head and quietly said I'm sorry y woo oh before finishing her sentence y wo had already put his hands in his pockets and confidently replied young lady you mentioned earlier that we need to protect the company comp's assets right so if I agree to the earlier invitation and join hanm Mo group will I and my family be considered company assets M was surprised what y Wu calculated secretly resolutely although I personally do not want to do this for the long-term safety of my family this is the only way y Yan Fe upon hearing this hurriedly asked have you thought this through Yu nodded and answered firmly of course I have thought very carefully about this decision M happily said great it seems that you have finally made your decision in her mind she thought whether it was due to the provocation from in chain before or for family reasons as long as he joins me that is the best outcome but y Yan feay on this side was worried silently thinking although joining the handm mo group is indeed the best choice given the current situation with his brother's personality he would absolutely not make such a decision for himself he acts this way for the safety of our parents and myself in other words our parents and I have become a burden to him forcing him to endure and become a pawn of others MIM moved towards yiu warmly saying here I Promise by joining the team you will be an important asset of the hanmo group you your family will receive the protection of the corporation from now on you won't have to worry about anything just focus on getting stronger by the way the board of directors will not take away your Authority this is to recruit talents for my team right sliver slow responded that's not the only thing young lady I suppose you want this kiddo to join the team right although his level is not truly what is written as level six on the board looking at his miserable and weak appearance how high can his real skill level be I advise you to think carefully about this otherwise if you use your power to shove a trashy individual into the team it will be difficult for both the team and the captain moreover it will also affect your reputation in the corporation M naai looked at her and replied firmly y Wu is not trash he speaks with strength not with your filthy mouths moreover my reputation does not need your concern she smirked contentedly thinking to herself you wouldn't even dream of how terrifying ye Wood's growth has been in such a short time he nearly lost his life at the hands of a level 18 Beast he has grown to a level where he can handle a rarely seen level 60 Beast his potential is impossible to Fathom but that's good the more you underestimate Yu the more it benefits me Moi continued so now I declare starting today y wo you are officially a member of our Mong team y woo upon hearing this asked what is the Mong team SLI slow also chimed in congratulating congratulations kid there are so many people with abilities in this world and they struggle to even get into the Mong team yet you managed to get in through the back door but don't celebrate too early once you get in you'll find that everything here is determined by strength those without strength in the Mong team can only live a life worse than death y Wu replied waiting for a moment do you all really hear what I'm saying from beginning to end I never said I would join the Mong team I said I would join the handm mo group both of them were shocked and asked boldly what are you talking about Yu smiled and explained Young you know I'm a person who enjoys freedom I don't like restrictive management rules if young lady trusts me like that would you mind letting me join the HMO group and lead the establishment of a new team sliver slow was astonished what you want to give up the top resources of the Mong team and start from scratch haha I thought you were just a freeloader but it turns out I was wrong because you're not just a freeloader you're also foolish foolish in a sweet way doesn't young lady see this humorous ability of yours sliver slow continued to laugh haha it seems you really don't know anything under the handm group indeed there are many small teams but whether in terms of resources or status they cannot compare to the Mong team choosing this difficult path is like slapping young lady in the face y w remain calm and said nonchalant resources or status are fine as long as the strength is strong it's not a problem the issue lies in whether I can work according to my own thoughts and style even if it's the Mong team I wouldn't want it Sliver slow chugged sarcastically haha young lady to be honest in my whole life I have never met anyone as arrogant as you I must say congratulations you have found Quite A peculiar Talent at least the joy of being around you in the future won't be lacking right Moi n was left speechless upon hearing this sliver slow prepared to leave waving his hand and saying your name is Yi Wu right if you're this confident then I'll leave the safety of the young lady in your hands I have to go to the front line and gather with my teammates now I have high hopes for your performance in the future Yu responded don't worry I absolutely will not let you down senior Moki n turned to ask Yu what you said just now were you serious he replied of course moreover I've already thought of a name for the team it's called King team this name isn't bad it gives off a powerful and domineering Vibe upon hearing this m n sighed helplessly I advise you to think carefully the matter of establishing a team while fundamentally simple is much more complex in practice when it comes to development first and foremost the most basic aspects of forming a team are funding and members these two factors directly determine the foundational development of the team she said in it are distribution resources including the tasks of punishment team scores eligibility for replication and many other things these things are usually owned by established teams and new teams basically cannot gain distribution rights they can only pick up a few leftover things from other teams in the end you will also have to face challenges from the oppression of other teams even if they are in the same organization no team will Overlook the strength of a Newcomer's start they will definitely think of all kinds of ways to cause trouble using all sorts of dirty tricks that you basically cannot guard against moreover the biggest problem is that once you enter the organization system my authority internally cannot help you you will have to rely on yourself y would scratched his head so that's how it is if that's the case the road ahead seems a bit dangerous seeing his reaction moai shouted so why did you refuse to join the Mong team y woo patted her on the shoulder don't you still understand the purpose of my actions M questioned purpose what purpose he replied I did this partly because I don't want be bound and on the other hand it's because of you from the earlier situation it seems that her position in HMO group is not very valued like the woman earlier she simply did not regard her at all it is clear that her current power is still quite low and her older brother and younger brother or others have started to launch an offensive against her in such a situation even if she forced me into moal team it would likely be difficult for her if that's the case why don't we establish a new new team that King team would entirely belong to her becoming her most solid backing Moi felt deeply touched only belonging to my unique power so you thought this far yiu but not long after yiu laughed and continued of course this has conditions that is the distribution of benefits of the team I decide that the benefits will belong to myself I can't leave out even one part the system rang out a notification the owner's weakened state has expired clearing the status y wo laughed this damn disadvantage effect has finally disappeared then my family will have to rely on the young lady for care I still have some matters to attend to Moi n saw him starting to move his lens and hurriedly said it's not easy to reach Z mate where else you want to go what can be more important than this Yu replied of course I want to go see how the professional team deal with the world boss this rare opportunity is not something I can miss Yu's parents seeing their son being Reckless quickly intervened it's too dangerous wooer don't do anything foolish yiu said even though father supports any decision I make that's a level 90 monster think it over carefully y yunay also expressed concern stepping in front of Y wo and earnestly saying brother I can understand how you feel but our family has only just reunited after a long time y replied I know everyone is worried about me but don't worry I won't be foolish enough to put myself in danger M I also reminded him I know what you're thinking but let me give you some advice the strength of this level 9y World boss exceeds your imagination also you have to face the other team members who are surrounding the monster outside if they decide to take action against you it might be even more dangerous than the Beast itself after all crowds can be scarier than the Beast Yi Wu confidently responded don't worry I know what to do I will stay outside and won't go into the team but y Wu is secretly calculating if I get the chance I definitely won't let it pass Mio y Stood Beside him watching the scene of the brothers comforting each other secretly admiring yiu is not only growing stronger but also has a spirit of Adventure no wonder Miss MO is interested in them joining the Han Mo group would be too good compared to him I feel utterly useless even though I came to Zone 8 what should I do next I don't know anyone here we all start from scratch and I have no idea how to give my parents a stable life suddenly Yu approached her and called out right mioya would you agree to join my team your parents will receive protection from the handm mo group you are reliable so I sincerely invite you to join do you agree Mi y was stunned then suddenly hugged y tightly joyfully saying I agree I agree but can I really Yun Fay seeing this angrily shouted hey what do you think you're doing let him go gently Yu thought this sounded very strange he turned around and asked is there a problem young lady moai helplessly replied the team is proposed by you the choice of members is entirely under your control I have no opinion to express Yan Fe seeing meow y still holding on to Yu angrily shouted are you listening or not Mio yak continued to hug y woo saying thank you y woo I will definitely not stop making myself stronger to become a qualified member of the team in your eyes she secretly made a resolution from now on I will only listen to your commands no matter what you ask me to do I will agree and do it y Wu turned to ask Wang Jong and Shen bbing do you two have any plans for the future wne jeno replied our home and Company are both in area number eight next we will just go back and report no me to worry Yu was pleased to hear this that's great so everyone has their Arrangements in order I can also rest easy to carry out a big battle now the Beast world of level 90 really excites me Wang jongo upon hearing this looked worried thinking facing this level difference instead of feeling scared he feels very excited this kit isn't simple but this also brought up a contradiction he said previously kid Ru died saving him this statement is very suspicious what was the real situation Yu's mother reminded wooer remember not to push yourself too hard his father also said you are grown up now and have become stronger father believes in your judgment but remember that survival is the most important thing Yu smiled and replied father mother I know ywu rubbed Nan's head and instructed Nana you must be good too when I'm not here father and mother will lead you to protect them Nana replied as you command master but in her mind she thought hurry and go you die and then I'll be free y Wu wave goodbye to everyone well then I'm off but m n stopped him wait a moment y woo let me send you the coordinates of the Beast and also share some supplies for handling it that way the risks will be a bit reduced saou also said I'll give you my tools as well you must survive and come back the system screen displayed Moi has sent you a trade request saou has sent you a trade request yo was astonished this is 10 level 40 ancient magic crystals five glare Stones which can cause blindness Five Ghost smokes to help Escape 10 Goblin traps three camouflage medicines and two dizziness Bombs all of them are Ultra practical PVP tools thank you two beautiful girls m n said remember to survive and come back for me got it Yu replied got it at safe Zone number nine yiu looked down and said even for observation there has to be some preparation if we get affected it will be a huge loss he ordered so go into the space system yo asked is there a way for the system to unlock a 100% strength account the system responded there is no way to achieve 100% but there are two methods that can increase the probability first first use 300,000 experience points to continuously unlock the basic King account as long as the quantity is large enough there will be a way unlock the strength account more youu wondered why does it sound like there are traps everywhere the system continued the second way is to use 1 million experience points to directly unlock a special King account this kind of King account will 100% create a special characteristic for the individual y w is surprise one million experience points a special King account How can there be such an account with his personality youw thought I will definitely choose the special King account it's just that 1 million experience points sounds a bit much never mind first I will refine the experience points from these ancient magic crystals and then decide the system responded Master you successfully converted 60 level 60 ancient magic crystals and 10 level 40 ancient magic crystals in total that is 180,000 experience points plus the accumulated experience points from previous battles your total experience points now amount to 720,000 Yi Wu excitedly said wow I have 720,000 already it seems those previous battles were not in vain after all moreover the collection of ancient magic crystals is also quite promising I need to include them in the list for future Gathering the system announced Lu Fang has sent a request for information to you Lu Fang said that's great boss finally the information has been restored y asked how is everyone over there what's the situation Ru and Tian tan replied we are fine we are all following what you instructed the support staff said that's right we are temporarily safe here based on what you said before Ruan TNN and I have gathered enough food to last a week however the principal is still in a weak coma yiu responded don't worry I have made some medicine to help with the recovery I will head over there immediately he said the no n area over here is about to have a battle the teams from the corporation are hunting beasts and the scale may affect the entire region everyone underground will likely be safe but they should not let their guard down everyone was surprised a beast battle is the boss going too how annoying I want go to too but I'm not allowed Yu reassured them first let's not talk about this anymore I will head over there right away then Yi Wu continued all right I can get a reply from over there now hanging up Yi Wu thought next I will split into three paths one first bring the medicine back to the principal then leave immediately two stay in the know Nine area and quickly defeat small monsters to accumulate experience points I must return before the beast battle three unlock the special King account suddenly missiles appear in the sky astonishing him are these missiles from a certain corporate team it's rare to see them in the no Nine area it seems that the teams have gathered over here already but I guess the beast battle won't start just yet after all there is only one Beast he said the coordination ratio between the teams is non-existent it's not about negotiation or starting some kind of Civil War afterward this this is also a time to accumulate my own experience value haha my only hope right now is for the remaining beasts in zone 9 enough for me to fully accumulate experience value y Wu thought 1 million I'm coming beasts I hope you won't let me down yiu ran quickly outside avoiding the wreckage silently thinking if the professional team steps in the risk this time might soon be eliminated but the specific time still depends on their efficiency he he continued running then recalled the conversation with principal Jong you were severely injured but have been given medicine so you stay still in the academy indeed it is the best arrangement I have brought back the recovery medicine to the academy that way all my worries have been completely eliminated he knelt on one knee to inquire about principal Jong principal do you feel better now he rubbed his head and replied you are fine now luckily you brought the medicine you saved my life y woo yiwu shyly scratched his sideburns saying a principal there's something I want to tell you a bit previously due to the unexpected event the equipment I hid in the Academy's room has all been taken outside and in the previous battle I also used a few items including your personal belongings please don't blame me hearing him sincerely confess the principal suddenly jumped up in Surprise causing him to be taken aback and say what are you talking about blame me I'm grateful to you I can't thank you enough as long as it's to deal with the beasts don't mention my personal belongings you can use any resources of the school freely it's just unfortunate that someone like me has become useless otherwise I would accompany you to battle against the enemy after saying this he couldn't help but cough a few times cough cough cough mizi saw this and quickly supported the principal's hand helping him avoid falling then said principal you have just recovered absolutely do not get agitated seeing the overly excited reaction of principal JN he fell silent but thought to himself although the principal is old now his enthusiasm is still the same as it was back in the day it's just that he shouldn't speak so loudly it scares me a bit emerging from the memory he immediately breaked hard and turned around then thought further having dealt with the schools matters it's also time for me to go hunt some monsters but from the way out of the school to he I've only seen a few beasts what happened he was startled when he noticed in front of him were mid-level monsters no longer the small ones in front of him were three monsters all above level 30 level 30 bloodthirsty wolf level 35 onee hell level 40 Warhammer Bull Red the wolf stepped forward looked at him and said Ming a fresh human he stood and stared at them for a moment the monsters continued to threaten the wolf bared its sharp teeth and said I thought all the humans had run away by now yet here comes a fool right to our door truly a lucky find the hell Beast cracked its Knuckles and added that's right a cow Salma told us to just stand here and not allowed to go outside to kill beasts it's so boring the Warhammer bull R then spoke up you want to die is Salma meant for you to vent if we have a toy delivered right to our door we might as well play around with it he showed disdain towards them looking around to see if they there were any more of them and said to them is this all there is where are your other companions it's not every day you get to meet a living person like me so shouldn't you quickly call your buddies out here too seeing him look down on them the bullhorn one got angry and swung his hammer down towards him shouting a mere level six trash dares to act so arrogantly I don't even need anyone else just this kiddo here is not enough for me to shove my teeth into the others seeing him angry said damn it Bullhead don't voke him one swing of your Hammer would crush him then what would we have left to play with he looked puzzled at his hammer which was blocked by the guy Shield he then taunted him that's right why are you getting so worked up I'm not wearing anything red am I then he charged up and chopped at his neck then said moreover you are the same this little experience value is not enough for me to stuff into my teeth anymore having been struck he cried out in pain ah a notification appeared experience Value Plus 4,000 the others saw this and panicked the horn Eagle exclaimed no it can't be the Bullhead has been killed the bloodthirsty wolf reminded the others this kid definitely conceals his strength holy [ __ ] everyone charge for me seeing them rush in he distracted them ran away and said no more fighting see you later the oneeyed demon saw this and said finished with your tricks and still trying to escape chase him he dashed past the Sleepy silly cat as it was dozing off it seemed to be dreaming of a feast and said Ma I can't eat anymore humans are really tasty startled by the loud noise it woke up and asked in confusion damn it what just flew by what's going on see it dazed and clueless the remaining ones kept chasing after him responding silly cat what are you staming there for chase after him another one seen the wolf running faster said bald wolf why are you running so fast this kid is mine don't compete the big cat seeing this asked in confusion where is the human I even think about the human in my dreams the scene was chaotic one guy chasing while shouting don't run damn it he's mine others were also in Pursuit then Yi Wu shouted loudly for them to hear come on come catch me try it seeing him deliberately provoked them like that they weren't polite anymore shot me back you idiot stop right there damn why are you running so fast stop I guarantee I will swallow you whole okay they kept chasing him while yelling in his Direction he continued to run looking back silently thinking 1 2 3 there are about 30 beasts from this area gathered here after Gathering them all to himself he stopped running and thought it's time to strike here the one demon and the Wolf were the two who chased him the fastest they were also exhausted panting and saying finally he can't run anymore the wolf catching his breath said then just obediently accept your death the protective barrier that he had set up early appeared surrounding him and the other monsters they looked confused and said what is this we are trapped we can't get out the notification system had booted up announcing the shield is formed lasting for 360 seconds the countdown has begun the oneeyed demon saw this and laughed loudly saying damn it you're too fast is your brain starred of oxygen haha you're even using the shield to trap yourself with us seeing him smug he coldly replied want to die together with you guys perhaps that's the case he turned to face them and continued but who dies is still unknown from somewhere two machine guns appeared cha violent Phantoms blasting robots combined with a final Phantom modified to be specialized they had pinpoint accuracy lasting for 1 minute with a coold down time of 3 hours the two guns fired continuously at the monsters without stopping trapped in the shield they could not Dodge the bullets only able to scream in pain ah the ones behind shouted loudly running fast while another angrily yelled at them what are you running for heun's all alone just bloody blocked the bullets the rest follow me as they turned back they were panicked by the small things on the ground one person saw them and shouted what the hell is this they are self-destructing robots with the ability to seek out enemies once they get close they will explode immediately causing immense damage only the sounds of explosions and screams echoed around he was protected by four Shields surrounding him and was unharmed continuous notifications appeared experience plus 2,000 experience plus 3,000 experience plus 4,000 experience plus 2,300 experience plus 3,000 experience plus 4,000 experience plus 1,000 experience plus 3,000 he calmly looked around and said indeed explosions are an art I wonder who said this first after the battle concluded a notification appeared battle summary has ended accumulated 120,000 experience points he still stood there nonchalant adding defeating monsters in a wave yields 120,000 at this rate it won't take long to gather enough however he realized that there were no more monsters in this area if he wanted to continue hunting monsters he would have to venture deeper into the territory of the strongest monsters which would complicate things further various colorful lights began to appear seeing this he thought to himself I'll deal with that later I need to clear the batt Battlefield first the previous battle was too large if discovered by other teams it would cause significant losses suddenly the system reminder resounded again the amount of money you have obtained is 860,000 the number of magic crystals you gather will allow you to enhance that many materials he picked up the yellow Crystal which was fragments of flying stones from outside the sky he couldn't help but exclaim little monster how could you produce a legendary quality item one out of five stars that means there are still four more fragments if they are combined will it be complete he turned to look at the surface of the stone and saw strange characters he wondered what is carved here I'd never seen this kind of pattern before could it be alien text the important thing is that after gathering enough who will be able to understand these writings how can we retrieve the information on it suddenly a voice came from behind him hey hey hey he turned around and saw a small SWAT passing by the commander of the squad asked what has happened here why is it so chaotic he continued to ask did he create all this it turned out he was Captain Liu level 55 from the fourth Squad of the Tian chuang group he intimidated him if you want to keep your little life you better tell me the truth he turned back honestly raised both hands and said Captain don't shoot I'm just a kind-hearted student I mean no harm seeing him say that he immediately asked back are you a student then he turned around and spoke to the guard behind check his identity and information a bit she obeyed raised the scanner to his head and reported the captain has confirmed the information this kid is indeed just an ordinary student he stood still for her to check but couldn't help wondering about this strange scene why is an ordinary student standing among a pile of dead beasts with equipment and experience points Left Behind like this he wondered how strange who could have killed this bunch of beasts suddenly he angrily pulled out a knife from his waist swung it up and pressed it close to his neck shouting all right speak what on Earth has a stupid level six student like you done here before he could finish his sins he was already interrogating waving the knife closely to his neck what did you see before who killed these beasts right answer me honestly do not hide anything feeling the sharp blade he hurriedly replied Captain spare my life our Academy was attacked by beasts I was lucky to escape but then lost contact with everyone I just kept running and ended up here I also don't know what is happening here seeing Yu's response his doubts were somewhat alleviated he said faced with all this an ordinary person would know to avoid it but you didn't dodge it seems you really are just a student living in Comfort with a slow reaction fundamentally unable to understand danger and death then he continued however this kiddo is quite lucky he has survived until now don't hinder my mission any longer this is the most crucial moment we're about to engage with the Mong team if you don't want to die then get away from me y would asked in Surprise Mong team he yelled that's the team at the top of the annual leaderboard it is said that each of their members is extremely powerful there isn't any replica that can challenge them this battle will be so different Yi Wu continued to show excitement trying to bait him into revealing more information they want to engage with the Mong team that's very valuable intelligence hearing y Wu compliment his opponent he angrily shouted Dan it let me tell you no matter how brilliant the Mong team may shine they must die today our tyan chuong group will replace them to become the new strongest team and furthermore at this point he suddenly stopped then he revealed a blued face recalling the woman beside the opponent unable to control himself he licked his lips and continued speaking I've heard that the slow slver is also coming she's a supreme treasure although she's a tough level to deal with but once their team is dead I will definitely Savor this flavor slowly hiy seeing him so smug he silently thought to himself Dan it let me give you a piece of advice This Woman's strength is too profound you would be helpless as well he saw that that this guy seemed to have a plan so we tried to Pro but even though your team is so powerful can you actually handle it have you guys come up with a plan or something the guy didn't mind answering that's right the plan is then de mly declared do you think I would tell you kiddo you haven't even grown enough hair what use is it for you to hear this get out he put both hands in his pockets calmly saying I'm just a student so please share everything you know I hope you can be reasonable the guy angrily took out a knife and swung at him shouting damn it idot I gave you a chance to live and now you dare to speak so arrogantly to me go die he attacked the puppet splitting it in half he stared blankly and said when did this happen he had already appeared behind the guy and said this is what happens when you act first don't blame me for harvesting your experience value after speaking he slashed at his back caught off guard and unable to react in time he screamed in pain ah the health bar of Captain Li to was down to 30% seeing that he was not dead yet he silently thought sure enough I can't take him out cleanly with my current linked level I can't kill someone above level 50 cleanly without an advantage I must change my strategy going one against five puts me at a disadvantage he angrily turned around and said to him damn it you bastard so you were actually this strong have you been pretending to to be stupid all along fooling us all the insignificant ones behind saw this and began to launch supporting attacks after that he charged forward and said I will tear you apart then figure remains to Beast he used his protective armor to block as the bullets flew towards him and thought the levels of these guys aren't low I won't be able to resist for long after all it's one against five I need to split the front and then break them all down he charged in with knives in both hands shouting die you stupid fool who doesn't know the vast heavens and earth daring to challenge our team alone he stepped back dodging his slash and retorted I'm not that foolish you know he jumped High revealing two machine guns behind him then said to him who doesn't have Firepower to call for help he was taken aback and shouted loudly holy [ __ ] there's also a cannon a warning system popped up attention the specificity of the infinite explosives is diminishing Master please pay attention to the remaining explosives and weapons he raised his shield blocking the bullets flying toward him then ordered this special Firepower suppresses Target me I can only protect myself you all handle this guy first I'll think of a way to take down these two cannons the others responded and charged ahead seeing this he wondered what's happening this flash had caused them to level up very quickly do they want to block my path everywhere it won't be that easy he swung his sword at them but they dodged effortlessly he couldn't help but be startled thinking not hitting them their speed is incredible what happened they surged together stabbing at him he cried out in pain ah the display board notified you have lost 40% of your health a beam of light Shone straight down he thought with some admiration no wonder they are a professional team their coordination is impressive he chose explosive Flame the fire burning large and high he looked at them and thought four beautiful people can't see this face perhaps it's the speed attribute of Thunder I totally can't keep up with them I'm in a PVD against a special attribute so I'm at a disadvantage moreover fighting four people at once is too much I feel like they are even stronger than the captain by lot what is happening is it just my illusion he turned back to the ad robot IIs i' this immediately checked within his space do you have any equipment or items that can increase your speed a bit I this quickly checked and said to him checking found it just so happens there's two items that increase speed thunderstorm electric armor level 45 this armor is from the head black tiger a previous Brigade it can significantly enhance speed attributes the enchanted item MC Queen har of course it is the personal item of the principal it can absorb electric energy to boost speed but the owner will definitely use it right because this MC Queen Hart is the last equipment that actually possesses enhancement effects he felt disheartened by his own wastefulness and said the personal items I managed to acquire have all been ruined by me right forget it as long as I defeat this small team I will definitely accumulate enough 1 million experience points there's also hope to unlock an account with terrifying strength then he resolutely raised his fist and said come here merge a dazzling beam of light surrounded him causing those guys to look confused use and say what's happening that person he wore a suit of armor surrounded by bolts of lightning then moved straight ahead and said originally as a guy you shouldn't compare yourself too quickly with others but the Lays want to pursue a fast feeling isn't that about speed then I will play to the end this is the thunder McQueen battle armor absorbing damage attributes to rapidly enhanced speed when being attacked it will cause the attacker to fall into a state of paralysis 25 female agents continuously shot at Yu the two of them said what if you change your armor we have the advantage in numbers speed and rank over you there's basically no way to turn the situation around not to mention we are experienced with bullets fire Ray enhanced by lightning and honeycomb Yu nibbly dodged the attacks from the two female agents he said not necessarily if I enhance the lightning blessing I have that too with his agility y charged forward and managed to attack one of the female agents she let out a painful cry ah they had a big question why are you suddenly so strong a female agent spoke up the speed of this kiddo why has he suddenly become so strong the other replied Don't Panic if it's a longrange attack it's useless let's handle him with close combat the two female agents Drew their swords and together aimed at y woo shouting slash they then inv the technique after image with his agility the maale lead dodged their attack he said except for my sister this is the first time I'm bullying another woman if my strength isn't enough please forgive me saying that ywu threw a punch at the two female agents he was a bit confused and said hey why does every hit come with the effect of blowing clothes off Thunder McQueen truly deserves to be called an old driver grenades appeared to be falling from nowhere Yu stared blankly and said this is when the grenades fall and blow up the place where I am standing the laughter of the female agent echoed haha she said even if your speed is fast enough it can't match ours we have more people than you this level 50 electric grenade is flashing with thunderstorms just consider it's sending you on your way guwu sneered looked at the attribute panel haha suddenly a surge of energy burst forth from his armor he said so that's why my entire body is filled filled with energy turns out you guys are helping me recharge may I ask is there anything else can you deliver a few more hits I can take it they were bewildered by Yu's words one of the female agents said this kiddo is a bit off the other replied that armor of is it can absorb electrical attacks and turn injuries into boost and strength damn it what exactly is his background why does he have such a unique armor he gathered the electrical energy towards himself and said if it's my turn to unleash my attacks wildly yuu charged in landing consecutive punches on the female agents they were attacked continuously screaming in pain they lay sprawled on the ground completely drained of strength to fight back their clothes and tatters the notification system announced target has only 10% blood left has lost Consciousness decides to exit combat status master has gained 880,000 experience points he thought to himself as long as the experience points are in my hands that's what matters there's no significant emity between me and them anymore no need for complete Annihilation but where did their Captain run off to my two cannons couldn't possibly restrain him for that long if he were to retaliate he would have started by now Captain Thunder thought to himself from behind I can't believe that he can keep shooting continuously for such a long time it has been so long is the ammo unlimited has the shooting finally stopped could it be that person has finally died Captain Thunder shouted damn it what are you all doing do you really need this long to deal with a kiddo hurry up and help me with the treatment will you Yu sat leisurely and said if I don't stop attacking are you planning to hide in there for the rest of your life he angrily yelled back damn you're still alive the female agent shouted angrily a bunch of useless trash can't even deal with with a kid stop playing dead over there get up right now if you'll come back you'll regret it Yu's expression turned serious as he said as a captain not only failing to defeat the opponent but also setting an example for your team while hiding like a dog he laughed and said team members no no no they are my slaves Li to pressed the switch to control the female agents they screamed in pain ah the male protagonist was surprised by his action he asked what's happening he replied kiddo your mouth hasn't even washed the smell of milk away you're only fit to be my fighting slave continue playing with them in round two haha the female spies rushed into attack yiu shouted ah he continuously dodged the attacks thinking to himself this is not right it's a skill of control through some kind of means A disruption of the central nervous system their shrill screams rang out ah hearing their cries he thought they were suffering he shouted loudly you scumbag you were being cruel to your own team members you are simply not worthy of being a captain Captain Thunder laughed contemptuously and said this world doesn't care whether you're despicable or not Winning is Everything although the lives of these female spies aren't worth much in exchange for a life they are after all trash it's fine we can find others later Yu replied seriously I agree with what you said earlier but there are many ways to win for example like this he rushed in and severed Lou's arm he screamed ah my right arm his arm fell to the ground and the control over the female spies ceased one by one they collapse Captain Thunder knelt down pleading please don't kill me you care about these women so much you must be very interested in them right I can give you these four women although they are all useless trash their skills in bed are top-notch ywu kicked Leu straight in the face causing him to lose his teeth he shouted loudly shut up the painful scream of Liu EOD ah Yi Wu spoke sternly simultaneously stepping on his face I don't need this L to cried out in despair ah it hurts whatever you want I can give you Yu said seriously tell me your plan how are you and Wong Jen preparing to deal with the mokong team give me the details it didn't take long for ywu to subdue Le to the captain who lay flat beneath his feet he surrendered and confessed everything I'll tell I'll tell we and Wang jang's Emperor team are secretly plotting to work together planning to Ambush the Mong team while they focus on defeating the strongest monster Yu couldn't believe the truth pressing down on his head to threaten him once more is that all there are many details you haven't revealed right this kind of low-level tactic could be thought up by a three-year-old if the Mong team is unguarded why can't you continue hiding things L 2 quickly confessed don't don't stomp there are more details he said according to the investigation by the detective team the strongest Beast Alliance has firmly occupied the Central Square of zone 9 and surrounding this area there are many Elite monsters but fortunately the distance between the strongest Beast and the elite monster ERS is quite far and the hostility is separated therefore our task at tyen chuang group this time is to lure those Elite monsters in the outer range so that the mo calm team is not affected by these creatures allowing them to focus on fighting the beasts y wo questioned wait a minute is your taian chuong group also a large company why you have to do menial work for the hanmo group what exactly is your relationship Captain L 2 quickly explained on the surface our taian chuong group group is indeed a large company but 80% of our business comes from the hanmo group so in reality we are just their junior subordinates we are always called back and forth by hanm Mo to do some laborious tasks in the end all the benefits go to hanm Mo and we don't get a share at all ye wo interrupted so in your hearts you have been resentful for a long time preparing to take advantage of your role as assistance to team up with Wong Jing to set a trap hanmo realized the issue you W slowly curled up and sat up Captain Thunder also stepped back kneeling in front of him he said that's right when the Mong team has taken 10% of the beast's Health we will lure the elite Monsters Inside then the collective will forcefully withdraw from the battle so the Wrath of the elite monsters will fall upon Mong once Mong is nearly killed we will join forces with the emperor to eliminate the Beast and the remaining Elite monsters this way we can obtain the resources and then blame everything on Wang Jen in this way we can not only gain Rich resources but also cause serious harm to hanm Mo achieving two goals with one effort y Wu interrupted Captain Liu this plan doesn't seem bad but the weakness is that it is overly idealistic how can you ensure that the M Kong team will not have any defenses against you Captain Thunder confidently assured Yu of course it's guaranteed if we talk about strength in the five ranks no one can compare to the main force of the m team but they have a critical weakness they are too arrogant ywu thought for a moment and then said so that's how it is after revealing everything Captain Thunder knelt down and bowed his head to ask yo to let him go you see I have revealed many secrets to you so can I leave now yiu shook his head as he looked at L 2 and then informed him of some unfavorable news which made him widen his eyes in Surprise well theoretically it could just be bad luck but not long ago right after joining the handm grou even though I wasn't very close with the Mong team I couldn't just stand by and watch the group's interests suffer like this knowing had been deceived Captain Liu angrily exclaimed what damn it you played me ah a just after finishing his words yiwu dealt him a fatal blow Yi Wu looked at him coldly and said I didn't play you from the very beginning I had no intention of letting scum like you off the hook if you weren't still somewhat useful you would have basically been dead by now after dealing with him y w turn back to look at the first female team members injuring him lying scattered in front of him as for you guys leaving it like this isn't a problem is it although in a state of unconsciousness it's not like there are any vital threats around the tyan chuong group will probably come to rescue them soon after defeating Liu Yi W received a notification congratulations Master you gained 50,000 experience points 800,000 currency and activated the level 50 lightning attribute magic Crystal which is a passive skill for hormone development y Wu is very curious about this skill so he searched for information according to the systems analysis hormone development is a passive skill that permanently enhances the attraction to the opposite sex it has a certain ratio of stimulation of hormones with the opposite sex causing the other party to become infatuated for a short period of time Yi Wu laugh loudly damn what kind of monstrous skill is this from the description it really suits a trap boy no wonder this guy can make those female team members obediently listen to him thus he reviewed the achievements he had made according to the systems analysis I want to win five hoping to soon achieve 10 the system began to provide the data winning a five-person PVP battle rewards an additional 50,000 experience points a total of 1 million experience points have been accumulated a achievement obtained experience is sufficient until the new year only a little distance left to the small Target Yu was overjoyed finally 1 million experience points are in hand then what are we waiting for let's immediately enter the system space Yu turned to look at the robot asking further hey Vis is there any way or item to actively enhance luck the robot replied sorry Master there are no such items but I can analyze your current luck status please please wait a moment the system began analyzing the current data indicating that y Wu was the lucky God the fortune of the owner was at the strongest SSG level completely not needing external assistance it will be done soon please trust me the feeling of opportunity has arrived Yu was very confident in himself his strength had been unlocked and his fortune had also been unlocked doesn't that make me the chosen one haha that's for sure the robot continued your organiz ation absolutely transcends the dimension of the plane only someone like you the owner have I encountered for the first time good then I trust my luck Yu said unlock the new special King account comprehensively the robot quickly responded to the command unlocking the new special King account comprehensively Yi Wu closed his eyes waiting for the upgrade but unfortunately he felt a very strange sensation he panicked and shouted system what's happening what is this black substance not good I'm checking the robot replied I sense a strong and malevolent wave of energy still unclear who this kind of feeling scares me the robot cowered behind its owner be careful observe the system what on Earth is this could it be that this account has a virus yiu was paralyzed all over unable to move it seemed as if some source of energy was possessing him here I am unable to move the system is also panicking trying to fix the account ah but cruel power has exceeded my thresholds calculating it all attributes have decreased by 99% unable to prolong actions the life loss value is currently being repaired Master please wait a moment there's no need to be alarmed the energy source is becoming increasingly stronger causing y wo great pain and discomfort he quickly urged it's strange that I'm not alarmed if you don't hurry up a bit more I'm going to weaken the repair is complete the system is back to normal the power of this darkness is still fading moving very quickly cough cough y Wu cannot stand upright clutching his chest and coughing violently the robot worriedly asked master master are you okay woo I'm sorry Master it's all my uselessness is fault the robot feels guilty and anxious towards its Master but ye woo reassures cough cough I'm fine but where has Lady Luck gone why is she hitting my face so soon Master can you still joke around he replied I don't know the basic data simply doesn't know how to lie feeling a strong sense of fear but with Yu's character he firmly decided not to give up he must uncover the operational principles of this account another account wants the life of the enemy let me see where this account originates from the robot was also excitedly cheering him on that's right who want Earth is this Divine being that has caused the master to suffer so much the system then sent out a new notification congratulations Master you have unlocked the first comprehensive unique King named Shadow King Yu said I want to know more about this account the system received the command and continued this is a name that makes the world tremble it is a symbol of strength from the Fallen blood race stemming from the deep will of the ancient it has once destroyed countless Worlds the star in its hand has always been dark until summoned by Mighty ones in the end they were only able to defeat The Haunting physical form of the Shadow k Master I always been waiting for your appearance to see if you have what it takes to become the next Shadow k y Wu widened his eyes in Surprise damn it my first special King account is actually a super villain as y Wu was observing the system notification he suddenly received new information Fusion rate 0% Fusion rate what on Earth is this yiu murmured the system quickly analyzed and provided additional information the Shadow King account belongs to a special King account it's time to upgrade the power of the account no experience points are required instead upgrades will be based on the increased Fusion rate Yu propped up his chin continuing to study no need for experience points but where could such a good thing come from the conditions for upgrading the fusion rate must must surely be more stringent than using experience points that's right this system is quite cunning the robot remarked and then the system continued to analyze further in order to enhance the fusion rate you must log into the account to create a private world complete specific events and related tasks what log into the account to create a private world is this the legendary time travel y wo exclaimed but then he felt the sense of unease in his heart pondering but why does it feel like entering there would lead to a dead end yiwu showed suspicion and insisted that the system explained further the system quickly responded I must remind the master only when the fusion rate is higher than 30% can the master barely self-control the account otherwise it will be dangerous and uncontrollable forcing usage may lead to the Master's Consciousness being obliterated by the private world the master must pay attention to safety Al just unlocking it could leave to death like this Yu was frustrated now you won't even let me use it and forcing usage could even cause apocalyptic destruction no wonder this super villain account is known this Shadow King is a devil why is it so Twisted he felt disappointed thinking I've gained 1 million experience points but don't know what to do with them so my 1 million experience points will just be wasted but at that moment the system provided more information actually there is a way the notification system in a dangerous situation one may be forced to use their account however it's difficult for the host to accept this method Yu said you're exhausting me just tell me what is that method the notification system that method is to consume money and experience points to prevent side effects furthermore this consumption is quite significant explain in detail how can I consume Yi Wu impatiently urged the system the system said the first method regarding money you need to spend 10 million to maintain a normal state for 10 seconds the second method is to spend 5 million experience points simultaneously extending the time damn it y Wu lost is cool the system spoke to advise host you're being too emotional but these words only made Yu even angrier preparing to attack the system are you messing with me I worked hard to earn that money and experience and now you want me to spend it all the system not only didn't stop him but seemed to pour more oil on the fire ye woed hemp I told you this system is wicked after a moment of thought getting angry at the system wouldn't help y Wu try to calm down the notification system 3 seconds y Wu side thinking forget it it's better than having no other way my experience points are almost zero I only have three million left but Yu still wondered when do I need these 3 seconds for Yu continued refusing for 3 seconds I have to get the documents perhaps those documents could be exchanged for some money but I don't know if it will be enough the important thing is who I can exchange them with suddenly an idea flashed in his mind making yiwu's eyes brighten he realized but the stricter the conditions of the power of the account the stronger it becomes even with just 10 seconds it could change everything the N area still has a few demon beasts but the experience value may not reach 500,000 for now I just have to quickly gather enough 10 million experience points before the battle with the boss begins thinking about this made him feel it's really giving me a headache how did my players become such a golden player like this after a moment of contemplation Yu decided to head towards the desolate area of the city I've gotten quite close to the boss's area it's not yet time to approach recklessly I should just clear out the surrounding monsters and hope to find a few remaining ones while lost in thought and observing as he walked you we've suddenly tripped over something looking up he was startled to see the corpses of numerous demon beasts he exclaimed could it be that someone has come before me and wiped them all out damn it I've arrived a step too late just at that moment y Wu felt someone lightly tap him on the back that person said Hey brother he thought I've become too unguarded I didn't expect someone to sneak up on me who are you y Wu turned back to look and saw before him a person who was both chubby and short with a round belly and A peculiar appearance he thought to himself how can someone with such a large physique move around without making a sound it turned out to be c g a person at level 50 silly G glanced at ywu saw him staring blankly and burst out laughing haha don't be so tense just relax are you here to watch the excitement too saying that he devoured his food while laughing with his eyes narrowed looking quite plump and adorable Yu thought to himself what does watching the excitement mean this person seems to be around my age but he is already at level 50 so sh G scrutinized ye woo from head to toe then chuckled looking at your appearance you neither seem like a member of a battle team nor like a Rel Hunter if you're not here to watch the excitement what else could you be doing at your level if you go over you'll just be an appetizer for the strongest ones haha Yu nodded feeling that what he said made sense he asked back what about you are you here alone Sayo G replied not exactly I am a relic Hunter for the team Horizon I heard that a level 90 demon Beast has appeared in area 9 so my boss sent me here to see the situation if there's an opportunity amidst the chaos who knows I might just find something interesting ye wooed City sh G began to chat intimately however in Yu's mind he had his own calculations he thought so this is an artifact Hunter he must not be lacking in money if I Rob him of everything who knows I might be able to shorten the target of 10 million but when he looked at Sai sh G Yu became hesitant but this person seems quite straightforward if I do that would it be too cowardly while he was lost in thought SE G suddenly stepped forward put his arm around Yu's shoulder and said hey hey how about we go together you would asked back to your team's Place sa G explained exactly things are really chaotic around here it's not safe to go alone besides we are here to see the excitement right it wouldn't be fun alone it's better to go in a group as y Wu walked he glanced at sael G and thought to himself why is this person being so friendly is there some kind of ulterior motive but he didn't attack me from behind earlier could he really be a good person after thinking for a moment Yu realize an artifact Hunter like him is not part of the team plan this might be an opportunity for me to make money yiu stopped scratched his head in confusion and then said well then thank you it is a bit scary to be here alone having a level 50 like you with me makes me feel much more at ease sael G heard him say that and confidently patted his chest laughing heartily don't worry leave it to me with me here those demon beasts can't hurt you Yu quickly formed a new team and invited the friend he had just met to join so sh cheerfully said our team is newly established I've invited you to join the team specialized in scrutinizing things so just accept it I really like the name of this team you who looked at the members of the team secretly please they are all experts this time I really have someone to rely on sea G was munching on a cake while patting y wo on the shoulder speaking with full confidence don't be so humble the brothers on the surface are only level six but their real level is not that simple in the city many players intentionally hide their levels it's not like us The Relic hunters in the wilderness the higher you flaunt your level the better it is to avoid trouble the two were engrossed in their conversation when suddenly a monster appeared the noise from their battle had attracted it the level 40 hole punch grunted fighting so much I finally caught the smell of meat haha Sil sh G quickly reacted rushing in to deliver a powerful punch to the opponent's face taking it down immediately he laughed loudly when humans are talking it's not your place to interrupt Beast y woo with a mouth shaped like an o and a mouth shaped like an a exclaimed in astonishment so strong it's all good my friend the Beast suddenly dashed out scaring ye woo have to death he suddenly realized that the experience points from this monster were not worth much leaving him feeling disheartened Sao G stood up brushed off his hands and said this monster didn't make me expend too much energy yiu felt a bit embarrassed and smiled sheepishly it's okay it's okay to be honest I am very surprised who scared who you look gentle but when you act you're ruthless like this indeed one should not judge a person by their appearance sa G laughed put his arm around Yu's shoulders and said cheerfully as they walked let's go I will tell you about our team's glorious achievements in the past I guarantee you will broaden your horizons the two continued their Journey with only about an hour left until the battle to quell different AA the whole punch that had been Disturbed was still alive breathing weakly and murmuring what a chatter box SI show gide this path seems tiring as they walked and chatted enthusiastically they finally reach area number nine we've arrived This Is Where We Gather isn't this the central area of zone 9 youu asked looking around to learn more sa G appeared very excited which made yiu Curious this place is packed with people are they all here to watch the excitement that's right ever since the news about the Wilderness spread groups of mercenaries and Relic Hunters have flocked here together silly G continued to act as a guide pointing ahead and saying the safe area is about 500 M from the strongest monsters if you go any further you'll attract the attention of the smaller monsters therefore most mercenaries and Hunters choose this place as their nearest base I see yiu replied nodding in understanding soon after C sh G quickly took y Wu to greet his Superior a person named Lan King Yun next to Lan King Yun was Zen Chen who seemed curious and asked hey show G you're back who is this SI sha G responded his name is Yi Wu I happen to meet him on the way and we had a great conversation just in time he also came here to see the excitement so I brought him along as sh G introduced him he waved for yiu to come over and greet them Yi Wu politely bowed and said hello brothers please take care of me one of the people standing there glanced at Yu and remarked level six this can't be your true strength right people at this level are usually either hiding from danger or already dead nobody has the spare time to stroll down the street and get picked up by our fat guy the name zen Chang was not very welcoming showing a sense of disdain and picking on others however how shuai had the opposite attitude he was very interested in yiu he quickly approached threw his arm around yiu and introduced himself surviving until now is quite impressive you must be pretty good at fighting right what level are you at y Wu humbly replied well I have to say it's mostly luck self-defense isn't an issue for me hearing this how Shou laughed heartily that's good I also don't want to be bothered by others although they had only exchanged a few words yiu had already formed certain conclusions about how shou's personality this person spoke very directly but had no bad intentions seeing y Wu's attentive demeanor sh G approached put his arm around W Wu and whispered don't worry brother ye there's no problem at all from the first time we met I felt you were a talent moreover you have a Charisma that I really like Yu secretly thought the person next to me really has a good eye for talent he feared has Hau discovered my special abilities has my kingly temperament been exposed Lan King Yun observed the two people talking and deliberately teased laughing so it's sh G's personality seeing you close to anyone is always like this you must have caused quite a bit of trouble for him right Yu waved his hand smiling not at all I've received a lot of care can you answer me one question why did you agree to join a strange Squad because the consequences of this are typically something only knowledgeable people avoid doing so what is your goal seeking protection or wanting a military strategy seeing his boss looking tense with Y woo sh G hurry to explain Captain it was I who active ly invited Yu to join before he could finish his sentence Lan King Yun motioned for him to be quiet all right sh G I want to hear the answer straight from him yiu calmly replied what if I say my goal is to slay strong monsters Rob equipment along with all the professional teams everyone present was shocked by Yu's answer including sh G he asked an astonishment are you serious yiu responded with arrogance how shua but that really too Reckless is there something wrong with your brain the captain however found Yu's answer very amusing and laughed haha really interesting boss are you being foolish or what Lan King Yun approached and patted y Wu on the shoulder you have quite the attitude I like you already little boy young people need to be a bit Reckless after all if you're going to dream dream a bigger dream what am I dreaming about I'm being serious y Wu retorted bluntly how sure a standing beside them glanced at his boss and shook his head in exasperation the captain is starting again this guy can't help but get excited whenever he sees a passionate and ambitious youth almost 35 yet he behaves like a child l king Yun continued now I officially welcome you to the team Horizon the temporary name is the probe Squad y wo shook hands with Lan K Yun thrilled to receive the captain's approval in his heart his feeling towards this team was entirely different from the mercenary groups and Hunters he had encountered before this was the spirit that a team should have just then a mocking voice echoed from afar what's all the noise about nawang walked over witnessing the entire scene he sneered isn't this land the star you still enjoy mingling with such lowly folks can you really pull in even a level six trash into your team your team Horizon should change its name to the corn station helping out the week together after saying that he burst into laughter filled with producation how sh I and Sh G replied angrily what does it have to do with you do you want to fight or what unlike the two's hot tempers Zen Chen calmly intervened you two don't get worked up Let the boss handle things like this l king Yun turned to maang with a confident demeanor challenging mahang our team Horizon is recruiting members it's not your black rock horse game place to give pointers I also don't have time to argue with you if there's something to discuss let's deal with it after the battle with the strongest monsters when the two of us can return to the Wilderness to resolve it maong was Furious but didn't know how to respond hemp who do you think you are to speak to me like that I've been wanting to sell the score between us for a long time come here let's resolve this right now SE G quickly explained to Yu about the person standing in front of them who was is provoking the teen leader Black Rock horse gang these are our Rivals their group has about 10 people and they usually compete with us for resources in the ruins I didn't expect they would come to join in the fun hearing this Yi Wu understood the situation clearly he began to analyze the situation but facing an opponent with such advantages in rank and numbers the morale and strength of the team Horizon are still not at a disadvantage what matters is their Captain Lan K Yun ma Wong quickly gathered the forces encouraging the brothers to regain their Spirit today we will crush the team Horizon the whole team shouted in unison kill them all as both sides were preparing to engage suddenly a strange figure appeared in the sky it was the Airborne craft of the mechanized Army realizing something everyone buzzed quick look that's sliver slow the stunning beauty of the Inc attack team she slowly descended to the ground causing some weaker individuals to be blown away by the powerful pressure truly she deserved the title of sliver slow Yu stood with his arms crossed excitedly cheering Miss sliver slow your entrance deserves a 99 out of 100 she approached him shaking his hand in greeting oh I didn't expect to see you so soon Yu also looked at her fondly replying it's truly Destiny haha sliver slow raised an eyebrow at him teasing you're quite bold you dare to run to the front line to watch the spectacle or perhaps you came specifically to find me after saying that she wrapped her arms around his neck pressing her alluring body against Yu leaving him at a loss for words he did not hesitate to drop a few teasing lines laughing ha is that so you saw through me already some individuals were very infatuated with sliver slow looking at ywo with jealous Furious eyes who is this guy what is his relation to miss sliver slow damn it I'm so envious don't stop me I'll kill him seeing those fools getting crazy with jealousy over him ye would try even harder to provoke them he wrapped his arms around sliver Slow's waist and said sweet words you are quite naughty Miss sliver slow just arrived and already gifted me such a big present how can I thank you the surroundings began to buzz what this little boy dares to H Miss sliver slow I think he won't survive until the next round the chatter around grew loud this guy really has guts daring to joke with sliver slow haha let's wait for the fun to unfold based on past experiences those who dared to joke with sliver slow are now lying in their graves with grass over a meter high sliver slow also leaned against him smiling you are really Brave those who dared to do this to me before didn't end well y Wu asked again really she continued to step close closer lightly stroking his body besides you know that's a pit and you still dare to jump in it truly shows whether to say you're overly confident in your abilities or just a fool yugu replied this isn't important didn't you want get closer to me to help me draw out the hatred I just tried to offend Miss sliver slow a bit to see what would happen looking at the face of Mo Elis Miss can you forgive me and not kill me hearing that she laughed and replied haha I didn't expect you to be so interesting no wonder eldis Mis values you I'm a bit intrigued by you now just then s yancha appeared and said Captain time is running out the team has taken their positions and is ready for action upon hearing S Young sha she responded inform everyone not to act recklessly until they receed my orders he bowed and replied yes sliver slow walked away saying y woo I'll remember this when we meet next time you you think about how to repay the debt Yu replied rest assured I will definitely make Miss sliver slow satisfied after exchanging greetings Yu ran into song yanel the latter glare and asked are you ywu he replied that's right what's up his eyes were filled with murderous intent reminding him I will have to keep an eye on you the system immediately announced the warning measuring the amount of killing intent overwhelming Master this guy wants to to kill you 10,000 times in his heart yiu was speechless thinking of himself this big brother has misunderstood that's why I said beautiful women bring disasters and now I've provoked another problem the system asked Master why don't you tell everyone about the team's conspiracy he replied the time isn't right right now I still haven't gotten close to them if I speak out no one will believe me and they might even see me as a fool I must wait for the critical moment to reveal it that way I can gain the greatest benefits the system side such deep scheming no wonder you're the master around them seeing the situation end so unexpectedly the crowd began to discuss damn it did sliver slow really just leave like that this guy showed clear disrespect and still survived am I seeing things what on Earth is this guy thinking with just this he could boast to the whole world another person chimed in if I had known it would end like this I would have tried it myself how sh I and see x g approached putting an arm around Yu and said brother I'm dying of admiration is Miss sliver Slow's waist soft does her body smell good you're really something messing around with sliver slow and still being alive you're the first one surrounded like this Yu's face darkened and he suddenly let out a grunt SI sh G immediately grabbed his hand pretending to sniff quick give me your hand let's see see if there's any lingering fragrance ye woo Furious shouted what you perverted fat guy let go get away witnessing this situation Lan King Yun and Zen Chang could only sigh in response Lan King Yun laughed and said haha this kit is really interesting Zen Chang thought to himself this Yu guy is not simple he must be aware it unlink to the ink attack team on the other hand the mang group seeing you getting annoyed while C show G kept holding on to him were left speechless and Confused the whole group sighed this level six kid is definitely not an ordinary person if we provoke him again what should we do now you return to the main topic what's up didn't you just say you wanted to fight let's continue hearing this the maang group panicked and ran away exclaiming huh fight damn it I didn't come here to fight against a monster like you he continued today I'll spare you as I need to conserve my strength to fight the monsters don't let me see you again in their hearts they thought I'm not part of the Inc attack team who knows what relationship you all have running away is the quickest way seeing them run away see sh G and how shuai quickly retreated waving their hands Yi Wu stood in the middle his expression darkening unable to hold back and shouted Don't Run Away the next time I see you I will kill kill you all you only know how to talk nonsense if you're capable then don't run stand in front of me land King Yun standing beside him side to Yu I don't want to get involved in your personal affairs but your performance is amazing how did you do that yiu replied it's just normal don't be so surprised Lan King Yun continued to tease is it normal to mess with a top tier team haha who exactly are you Yi wuli answered didn't I say before I'm just an ordinary student lucky to have met some people from the team and learned a few ways to make money upon hearing the word money see sh G and how Shu I immediately came closer shouting ways to make money brother you have this skill why didn't you say so earlier hurry up tell us share a bit y wo was Silent not knowing what to say to these two money hungry individuals l king Yun smiled Riley and said you guys calm down don't make y woo uncomfortable then he turned to ywu don't be surprised People Like Us who hunt for relics are very sensitive to the phrase making money can you elaborate more on how you intend to make money Yu replied it's fine although I have only recently come into contact with everyone I have a very good impression of you all I am willing to share the way to make money with you but under one condition Hing Yun curiously asked what is the condition Yi W answered that is how much money are you all willing to invest in this money-making method hearing those words everyone exclaimed what Zen Chang said negotiating money let's be honest this is just a low-level scam he continued with an analysis what you did earlier was to make everyone believe that this is not a scam this is indeed a way to make money that a normal person would not proactively reveal like this if you made the effort to reveal it to us so that we could join in it certainly involves risks that you couldn't handle alone you looked at Yu emphasizing further combining with what you just said earlier kid has your profession always been robbing monsters from other teams Yu gave a thumbs up indicating his agreement and providing a very accurate analysis he said I really enjoy trading with intelligent people they say this is fundamentally impossible to achieve however I see it as just a superficial appearance in reality it's not like that Yu continue to explain his method of making money with this method everything is possible l king Yun asked so Yu how much do you need to invest and what will the return be Yu replied at least 10 million with no upper limit the more you invest the more you can earn to clarify further I will continue analyzing upon hearing Yu's words how Shu I and C sh G were taken aback how how Shu I exclaimed 10 million if you want Rob just say it directly I will come to compete with you yiu smiled and responded brother do you think I'm joking this number cannot easily be obtained even Lan King Yun fell silent while Zen Chang laughed heartily clearly amused however Yu insisted I'm serious I'm not joking investment is like that the higher the risk the greater The Profit Lan King Yun replied you need to clarify the details about how to make money and that decision so that we can assess whether it's worth investing or not if we invest this amount what would the profit be upon hearing that the members of Lan King yun's team including Lan King Yun herself were all very shocked boss are you serious yiu replied I can't reveal specific details for the first question yet but when we finalize our collaboration I will share everything at the appropriate time as for the second question question I can answer it with certainty after we succeed what everyone can receive is at least 100 million hearing this amount even Z Chang and Lan King Yan were left speechless Silo G and ha shuai were so shocked that they couldn't say a word 100 million are you kidding me Zen Chang said buddy I don't want to laugh but do you really not know how much 100 million is hearing this Yu got mad and turned to the two of them what so so funny why don't you dare to imagine a little Zen Chang replied so in your imagination we first overthrow the two major teams Horizon and mo attack team and then defeat the level 90 monster before we can get 100 million no matter how rich my imagination is I can't Envision something like that how sh I said to c g I'm telling you how did this chubby guy end up with such a ridiculous name l king Yun sat down and said to yiu don't mind them they aren't intentionally mocking you it's just that for someone new like you to say such unbelievable things you don't need to say anything not long ago we encountered an unexpected incident that caused most of our valuable assets to be lost therefore even if we trust you we can't take out such a large sum of money Yu replied it's okay business cannot be measured by righteousness I am very happy to meet everyone after all in this day and age there aren't many people who are as sincere as you all y w whooped the control panel intending to leave the team then said so I don't want to delay your time any further first of all I will leave the team however land King Yun hurriedly said out loud wait G woo I haven't finished speaking yet although we don't have that much money I know who does and we can go borrow from them together you would asked in Surprise borrow what do you mean at that moment in the battle between mang's Black Rock horse gang and the Monsters a panic subordinate said to maong boss we are facing two bite level monsters at the same time isn't that a bit too much our health is dropping fast like it's on an elevator mang replied I'm afraid that if we really can't hold off the opponent they will have to head towards team Horizon because that team is nearby surrounding them are monsters with very low Health the Black Rock horse gang tried to Rally their teammates spirits come on just hit the morale structure a little more we will win however things were not as easy as that a reptile suddenly approached them everyone jumped in surprise when they heard a sound echoing from behind they turned around and saw deep affection single eye and Earth tunnel stubborn bone the whole group panicked damn it who the hell released such monsters if it weren't for us how could they make such a rookie mistake they saw the mechanical bug crawling towards them and suspected that it was was up to something sinister one member of the group angrily kicked at the bug saying get lost another teammate repli irritably damn it wait however before he could finish his sentence he kicked the Bug hard immediately an explosion erupted they were all blown away uh ah they were confused not understanding what was happening who who set off the bomb Mal Wong urged hurry up and heal if not however right in front of them were a light level monsters they were taken a to see four a light level monsters gathering together in one spot the monsters slammed their maces down towards the crowd piercing the air with desperate screams damn it we're definitely dead however the mace did not strike them as it was halted an energy cage appeared enveloping them who activated the energy cage smart move yet one of the group suddenly realized something strange wait our team didn't even purchased this kind of high-grade energy cage don't waste money just then five figures emerged from behind them a voice rang out long time no see black rock horse gang I've missed you guys M Wong's group stood Frozen staring at the newcomer it's you guys the Y wo team appeared and Y wo smiled saying it seems you are in quite a dangerous situation luckily I managed to act in time to use the protective energy cage to Shield you he continued as for how long this energy cage can last it depends on your sincerity meong stood within the energy cage looking up at Yi Wu questioning you brat what do you mean y Wu nonchalantly replied to put bluntly your lives are in my hands if you want live it's easy just hand over the money the others in the Black Rock horse gang shouted in Anger are you still not ashamed taking advantage of our Peril to ask for money what are you even even talking about only maong the leader of the group remained silent observing yiu for a while now yiu had tucked his hands into his pockets and turned to leave maang quickly shouted 3 million he raised his hand to stop him save our little teens's life I'll give you 3 million Lan King Yun slung his sword over his shoulder glanced over and said 3 million are you begging last time you guys devised a scheme to seize our Resource number number 69 it was worth more than this at least 6 million if you want to survive mwang shouted loudly what do you mean 6 million even if I die here killed by the demon Beast I won't pay 6 million he clenched his fists and continued that incident with number 69 can only be blamed on the traitor in your team we merely took advantage of him when the juicy meat comes to your mouth would you not eat it if it were you you would do the same Sil sh G heard this and was so angry that he stood up grinding his teeth as he said what clearly you guys have colluded with each other for a long time yigu raised his hand stopping Sayo G and coldly said all right we are not here to argue nor do we need to bring up past grievances I just want to remind you that the energy of our protective shield is running low there isn't much time left right now the Wrath of the demon Beast is focused on you guys he continued the leaf of our defense fence just cracked creating a gap and immediately an arm of the demon Beast reached in and grabbed the nearest member of the Black Rock horse gang the group panicked and screamed ah help boss save me one of the gang members trembling with fear quickly said we agree as long as they leave our team will remain intact and we can earn the money back sooner or later Matt Wong looked at his teammates behind him gritted his teeth and said all right 6 million it is I'll give it right away save us Yu looked at him smirked slightly and said slowly too late I've changed my mind now it's 12 million M Wang exclaimed in shock what this guy you intentionally raised the price scheming to fleece us ywu crossed his arms and watched him cheerfully admitting that's right I am scheming wanting to fleece your assets did you just realize this now crack our defense is weakening the hand of the demon Beast took the opportunity pierced through another Gap and reached in to grab someone everyone saw the hand of the demon Beast reaching towards them panicking and shouting ah boss hurry up Ma Wong saw the claws of the Demonic Beast reaching towards him and quickly said all right 12 million but I can only give you 6 million up front the rest will be given after you save us yiu stood with his hands on his hips happily saying 15 million if there's any more objection each objection will add 3 million ma Wang quickly agreed okay I understand Yu looked at the system screen where the message appeared M Wang has made a transaction of 15 million with you do you accept he quickly lifted his hand to accept the money smiling joyfully good you were lucky to meet someone like me if it were someone else they might just stand by and watch you get killed and Rob you of your money ma Wong stood behind looking at Yu's back with resentment thinking to himself hemp this kid is still holding back no matter what his relationship is with me and Hine of the Inc attack team if he doesn't kill me today I will kill him later Yu raised his hand and said loudly the money is in hand Brothers letun get started the group of land King Yun quickly Advanced collectively shouting all right let's go one by one they attacked with powerful techniques EP tornado 100 Shields Rush chain of thorns meteor and arrow rain the Demonic Beast was beaten to a pulp continuously screaming the members of the Black Rock horse gang seeing the Demonic Beast being destroyed lamented this Elite Beast was originally ours ma Wang had not finished his sentence when he angrily said don't worry just follow my orders a loud explosion rang out bang bang bang sea G was shaking off his hands happily saying we have captured them all y these Elite level demon beasts have some strength but in the end they couldn't withstand a single blow suddenly a series of bullets whizzed past him vroom vroom vroom everything happened so unexpectedly that c g could only stand there and it days he exclaimed damn it the explosion sounded again Bang Bang Bang the debris was thrown up from the ground ground with such force that the building next door trembled as if it were about to collapse amidst the Thick Smoke and dust ma Wong let the Black Rock horse gang forward his face was filled with cunning and he smiled as he said if I were you after getting the money I would leave immediately who would keep their word to save their enemies he commanded heal us faster then kill them to let them understand that in this era of order only the ruthless can survive till the end Yu shot him a glance and asked mockingly is that so at that moment from behind l king Yun and how shuai unexpectedly attacked surrounding the Black Rock horse gang Lan King Yun placed a sword on the neck of one member of the group and coldly said don't move haui stood next to them aiming his gun at the others his brow furrowed as he commanded if you don't want your head to turn into a cactus then be a little more honest the people in the Black Rock horse gang looked back in astonishment M Wang desperately shouted even if you can control our healing we still have the advantage in numbers he quickly gestured to his teammates Brothers use the last recovery potion even if we can only recover 30% we could still kill them all yeu spoke up advantage in numbers ha before he finished speaking gunfire erupted from behind the members of the Black Rock horse gang were shot Den instantly the number of casualties rising to eight sh G Furious LED six more people competing with each other to see who could take down the most enemies the remaining members of the Black Rock horse gang looked in horror as their comrades were picked off one by one following that was a loud explosion boom boom ywo stepped out from the smoke happily counting out loud four he swung his sword again taking down another person and counted three he coldly continued now do you still think you have the advantage in numbers Maman looked around seeing that everyone around had been eliminated trembling all over stammering you you were already prepared Yi Wu drew his sword from his shoulder looked at mang and said you are mistaken in this era only strawman can survive until the end upon hearing this mwang felt anxious and thought that the situation was not good of the 36 strategies running was the best one he thought to himself I don't want to die here with that thought he immediately turned and ran away sash G noticed that mayang was fleeing and shouted loudly are you going to abandon your brothers and run away alone are you still a boss mang coldly replied damn it brothers are just sacrifices he cast a fierce glance behind him and continued harshly As Long As I Am Alive I can find other brothers in this era everyone must fight to survive that damn Brotherhood has no value at all as soon as he finished speaking me Wang turned around only to see a blade blocking his Escape Route forcing him to stop Lan King Yun snickered and said do you think you can escape even if I agree your brothers won't at that moment one of the group who was being threatened by haua with a gun to his head looked at mang in anger and shouted how can you abandon us boss you once sent we live and die together sharing blessings and misfortunes turns out it was all of deception at this moment M Wang could only fall silent kneeling down and bowing his head saying hemp I never expected that I MA Wong would become so lost having fallen to this extent if you want to kill me just do it Yu moved closer to him lowered his head to look and said it would be a Pity to kill you after all a group of more than 10 members must be worth more than 15 million and what about the money hand it over melang panicked looking up at him exclaiming in horror you you're truly a devil I I have no money left l king Yun pointed the tip of his sword at his head sternly saying still talking tough you Black Rock horse gang rely on your numbers to bully the weak often robbing oppressing others stabbing people in the back there's no way you can only scrape together 15 million meeting y wo today is something you brought upon yourselves this is what you call an evil person encountering another evil person for judgment ye who listen to L King Yun describ him like that and secretly complained I'm a messenger of Justice how can I be branded as an evil person like this he sat down staring directly at maong and said as a team leader carrying too much money on you is very dangerous if I were you I would definitely find a safe place to hide it if you tell me the location honestly I could spare you m Wong could not have imagined that y Wu could guess the entire situation with just one sentence he stared at y wo in shock so frightened that he lean back so you know everything damn it you tricked me mwang panicked and took a step back suddenly realizing that from the very beginning he had fallen into a trap he felt exploited by y Wu considering him a greedy and Shameless person hearing ma Wong say that y Wu immediately understood the situation he turned to se sh G with a cheerful smile and said I was just guessing but it turned out to be true so he really was hiding money SE G praised y Wu without reservation even giving him a thumbs up well done brother meanwhile ma Wang sat on the side so Furious that he spat blood he suddenly went mad laughing loudly haha I have money hidden and a lot of it too but don't even think about me telling you if you want to kill me go ahead but you won't get a single scent from me haha at that moment one of Yu's team spoke up I know where the money is hidden let me take everyone there maang upon hearing this clutched his chest Furious enough to spit blood for the second time he spun around glaring at his brother and screamed how could you know that the man despite having a gun pointed at his head remained very calm he stood with his arms crossed not bothering to look at his opponent and coldly said shut up earlier when I happened to go to the bathroom I saw you acting mysteriously so I was curious and followed you the place where you hid the money is in that dilapidated Warehouse Malong was truly enraged to the point of madness he swung his sword and quickly charged at the man shouting damn it I'm going to kill you at that moment c g quickly rushed forward using his shield to block mwang slash the sound of the Clash rang out he cheerfully said why are you so angry ha this just shows Yu who was carrying a sword Stood Beside him and continued one his underlings said is true yeu sighed and added it seems I need to give another piece of advice in this era besides being ruthless and becoming a top tier strongman you must also remember to bring your brain mang was so infuriated that he couldn't form a coherent sentence l king Yun with his knife resting on his shoulder approached y Wu and asked wait a minute y wo can I have him I want to personally end the feud between him and me y Wu replied easily please feel free l king Yun looked at mwang and said in a deep voice although we have many unresolved grievances I just want to know one thing where is Hui he coldly replied who knows how many traitors there are in the team why are you asking me that guy has long been tired of playing the Brotherhood game with you people he saw l king y silent and thought he was hurt by these words so the excitedly added he just wants to make money that's why I encouraged him to design a scheme to harm you all haha although I don't value brotherly affection at least it still makes them wealthy and you guys you talk about brotherly love but you're pitifully poor have you ever thought about how they feel haha Lan King Yun you are just a worthless piece of trash as soon as he finished speaking Lan King Yun swung his sword down splitting the man in two the immense power power created a deep trench on the ground accompanied by a deafening explosion boom Yu looked at the large Stone split in half with a long Mark still visible on the ground feeling a bit frightened and thinking the force is really strong although also at level 60 it feels more powerful than Mo elest misses level 60 Bodyguard the system displayed a notification PV Victory the team has repaired the roof achieving 100,000 experience points each member in the group is evenly distributed achieving 2 million notification system 50 magic crystals each with 20 units the golden cudgel once the best weapon has been damaged and can be

luminous beads in the dark that can be sold for a good price l king Yun shyly looked at y Wu and said I fear you will mock me Yu replied perhaps The Demon King is right if I cannot leave my brothers to better days then even if I'm correct it's just empty words yiu silently gazed at him while everyone around encouraged land King Yun how shuah loudly declared boss what are you talking about don't let the dead affect you you have your principles and it's those principles that make us want to follow you SE sh G joyfully chimed in that's right if you were a wicked person I would have never respected you Zen Chen Stood Beside Lan King Yun and said calmly don't say such nauseating words anymore get your spirits up I don't want to entrust My Little Life to a boss who is feeling down Lan King Yun stood in the middle looking at everyone around touched by the feelings of camaraderie among the team members youu observed them rallying each other's spirits and felt that this team was truly ideal perfectly to his liking a team where the members trust and are bound to each other like this is just right at this moment he interrupted everyone saying all right let's go we need money right follow me and you all will make a considerable amount he turned turned and walked ahead with everyone quickly following and happily saying that's right Brothers y Woo is our lucky star I really have a Keen Eye for people wait for us the last surviving member of the Black Rock horse gang led the way followed by y Wu and L King yunk group ywu asked do Relic Hunters like you typically have a habit of hiding Adams l king Yun quickly replied that's right after all our profession carries many high risks who knows one day day we might run into trouble on the road so we usually don't carry too much money instead we hide items in caves out in the wilderness but hiding things within safe zones like ma Wong is quite rare the man leading the way in front heard this and turned his head to say captain actually mahang has never hidden anything after all we are a large group and usually The Relic Squad doesn't pose any threat to us this time perhaps because they are afraid of conflicts with the professional team they temporarily found a place to hide Lan King Yun upon hearing this responded in surprise I see the man LED everyone to a bunker looking from the outside the door of the bunker had been broken due to the impact of bombs we have arrived ahead is the place where mahuang hid the money Sao G anxious said what are we waiting for letun go Yu suddenly raised his hand to stop him wait a moment sash G was startled looking at ywu and asking huh what's wrong at this moment a digging sound echoed from ahead dig dig dig Yi Wu raised a finger to his lips signaling sha and whispered keep your voice down there's some movement ahead in front was a level 65 demon Beast secret demon of the do treasure happily digging into the ground with a shovel it seemed to have found many good items on its back it carried a large bag filled with treasures joyfully digging and laughing gather gather digging Treasures digging Treasures y wo continually stirred up the ground digging and digging causing everyone around to look on in astonishment that person was yiu he turned his head to look at everyone a puzzled expression on his face the book mentions secret demon but what's so special about this secret demon of the do's treasure C sh G's eyes lit up he grabbed guwu shoulder excitedly exclaiming damn it we get the jackpot bro we're going to get rich how sh I and Zen Chang quickly step forward to cover C sh G's mouth Whispering you idiot keep it down if it runs away we won't make a dime c g was startled and quickly nodded in agreement with the plan to keep quiet the group including Lan King Yun and Y Wu moved to hide behind a large Rock to observe the secret demon of the do's treasure l king Yun explained the secret demon of The Da treasure is a very rare type of secret demon especially one with such a high rank is even rare they usually like to seek out money and treasures therefore wherever they appear there is sure to be a large amount of wealth nearby you looked at the demon beast in front of him and smirked asking so the money that M Wang hi here attracted this secret demon of the D treasure Lan King Yun continued do you see the bag it's carrying that bag is a dimensional bag all the money and treasures it has gathered are inside it's a bottomless bag the whole group watched attentively each filled with hope yiu looked at the demon Beast that was joyfully bouncing on a chest on its shoulder was a large bag filled with treasures money and weapons yiu said if we handle it we could take all the treasures in that bag that's why I said it's a fortune Lan King Yun responded that's right but that's only a small part the most important thing is that I've heard if we kill this secret demon there's a chance it will drop a teleportation Talisman key to their Lair at this point a hint of excitement appear on Lan King yunk Face I've heard there are piles of treasures in their Lair yiu glanced at him and asked naul oh really but it's probably not easy to deal with it what are you planning to do Lan King Yun looked at the joyfully bouncing demon beast and quietly replied it is indeed very difficult to deal with the challenge isn't in whether we can kill it but in whether we can catch it as long as we startle it a little it will use its fastest speed to escape if we don't catch and kill it within a short time it will summon a portal to run back to its lirer at this moment SE G and how shuai along with Zen Chen we standing behind them observing the demon Beast Zen Chen added so the success or failure depends on whether we can catch it or not how Shu I also spoke up that's right but it's very hard to catch match many years ago when I was still a newbie I once went out into the Wilderness with a team of 10 people at that time we encountered a nor level 25 demonic Beast even though we surrounded it It ultimately managed to escape everyone was talking while staring intently at the Demonic Beast before them its shoulders and legs were adorned with jewels and its Speed and Agility far exceeded their expectations yiu at this moment confidently said there's no need to worry about this I have a particular talent for capturing if everyone trusts me then just do what I say s g patted y Wu on the shoulder and happily said of course we trust you why wouldn't we ye woo you are our lucky guide whatever you say we will listen behind them a man from the Black Rock horse gang lightly pushed Yu's shoulder and said I'm not participating anymore can I leave now s g cast a glance at him and waved his hand get lost get lost but don't make a sound as soon as he heard that the man quickly ran away not forgetting to loudly say thank you thank you SAA G watched him leave and angrily shouted damn it can't you understand human language I told you not to make a sound Yu stood next to him dumbfounded how shuai and Zing Chang quickly subdued C G again covering his mouth Lan King Yun stood to one side shaking his head as he watched them y Wu awkwardly smiled and said all right all right everyone pay Attention our plan is as follows in one corner of the treasure chest the demon Beast was happily stuffing all the things it found into its bag it mumbled to itself ha all the treasures are mine don't even think about competing with me suddenly it heard footsteps instantly it glanced over and was astonished to see y woo and the others standing behind it looking at it greedily haha not bad Harvest how about sharing a little the demon Beast quickly fled as it ran it turned its head to look at them teasing haha you can't catch me ner nener yiu commanded the robot to translate what the demon Beast was saying the robot translated while also vividly describing the demon BEAST's attitude foolish ones come catch me and see haha hearing these words Yu's face turned dark he covered his face with with his hand feeling embarrassed and said I think I might have said something like that before after saying that Yu swiftly drew his sword blocking the demon Beast path sorry I'm just interested in your money however the demon Beast didn't care about you was words at all confidently it continued to run straight toward him in a Nimble maneuver it quickly slipped between Yu's legs and escaped with astonishing speed sa G used his large Shield to block the pathway and said with me here you won't be able to get through unexpectedly the demon Beast lightly jumped over his shoulder before leaving it turned its head back and scoffed relying on you Soo G was so Furious that he gritted his teeth damn it no way at that moment how shuai and Zen Chang quickly rushed over how shuai raised his weapon and shouted stop let's see you handle three of my arrows Zen Chang also swung his [ __ ] whip to attack however the demon Beast possessed incredible speed it effortlessly dodged all their attacks sometimes flying up other times gliding to the right and then jumping high to the left it smiled mockingly useless suddenly Zing Chang's spiked chain wrapped around its leg the demon Beast looked back in shock while c g excitedly shouted good job Four Eyes Zen Chang angrily yelled shut up do you want to die while they were still bickering the demon Beast pulled out a knife from the treasure bag on its back it easily cut through the spike chain and ran away laughing wickedly he zenj angrily said to be able to cut my magic thn that knife is no ordinary one as the demon Beast was happily running away suddenly a cage appeared from above and captured it inside everyone in Lan King yun's group quickly ran towards the cage how Shu I hurriedly said that protective cage won't hold it for long kill it quickly Lan King Yun quickly complied and approached the demon Beast that was desperately trying to saw through the cage with its weapon haha the demon Beast sneered and just as it escaped from the cage it was surrounded by Lan King yunk group sa G blocked its way shouting loudly raise your hands and surrender you won it away how sh I cheerfully added let's see how you run away with us surrounding you like this the demon Beast looked at them grinning strangely haha it raised its hand to form a cross shape immediately from the One initial demon Beast five more appeared making a total of six they ran wildly in all directions creating a cloud of dust Yi Wu seeing that situation was astonished and gasped damn why does this move look so familiar is it learning from Comics everyone seeing the swarm of demon beasts rushing in various directions shouted we split up to chase them absolutely do not let them Escape try to funnel them in One Direction the demon Beast group simultaneously shouted run everyone l king Yun quickly received the order increasing their speed while chasing insane its speed has slowed down l king Yun who was running in front continued it must be that its clone has scattered its demonic power we have a chance to catch up to it how sh I run running from behind surged ahead cheerfully saying then I must speed up a hunter's glint appeared on his face in 30 seconds his Critical Strike rate hit rate and movement speed increased significantly suddenly C sh G riding on his shield dashed ahead swiftly causing haua to stare in shock damn it fatty how are you so fast sash G riding on the shield happily replied haha even though I'm chubby I'm very agile just watch the ultimate skill I have trained hard for handland surfing chubby pouring demonic power into the shield to move at the highest speed possible smashing through all the obstacles in the way how Shu I angrily yelled what are you doing with A Warrior's Life Shield while the two of them were still arguing Zen Chang leisurely said really each of you is so noisy you guys when will you ever grow up he sat on the Magic Carpet which could fly at high speed and ility for 2 hours the carpet could fully serve all kinds of hot and cold drinks and even snacks all items on the carpet were reinforced with gravity magic so he didn't have to worry about spilling or falling out while flying on the carpet he leisurely enjoyed a cup of hot tea and said casually can't you be a little more polite like me below how shuai and saam master looked up both astonished and angry then quickly reported to the referee someone is cheating Lan King Yun laughed hardly haha good everyone has a fighting Spirit as the teen leader I can't fall behind I need to show some skills after saying that he stomped hard on the ground causing the Earth to sink and break apart immediately he dashed towards the running monster his extraordinary strength evident in every movement he swung his sword and cleaved the monster in half exuding a mighty Aura he jumped up and delivered a powerful slash making the distance and height of the leak greater and the wound on the monster deeper he decided to change his name to Lan King Yun because he thought that name sounded cooler the monster he struck exploded turning into a cloud of black smoke l king Yun stared at the black cloud angrily cursing damn it this is fake at that moment the people from house shuai also shouted boss over here we also have a fake Lan King Yun turned around quickly and said to ywo your true self is over there ywu Stood Still calmly watching the demon Beast running towards him the demon Beast thought that this lowly human was the easiest to deal with the group of land King Yun saw a strange space appear behind yiu the demon Beast had opened the teleportation Talisman and everyone anxiously shouted ye woo you must stop it we can't let it Escape back to its Lair at this moment the demon Beast had already run past ywo it thought this foolish human is dreaming of capturing me dream on seeing that it was about to run into the teleportation Talisman the group of L King Yun was so anxious they cursed damn it ywo what are you doing why aren't you stopping it Yi wo remained calm standing in place smirking and telling everyone not to hurry just then when it was just a few steps away from the teleportation Talisman The Demon Beast suddenly stopped it noticed the bul right next to Yu it's it the demon Beast quickly turned around covered it sat down and hubbed the book tightly the group of Lan King Yun was astonished why did it suddenly change direction what is that thing on the ground over there the demon Beast blushed shily staring at the adult magazine intended for ages 18 and over the book quickly captured its attention causing it to become engrossed in the images within while the demon Beast was still absorbed a cage suddenly appeared surrounding it this was a sophisticated level 60 Beast trap specifically designed to deal with demon beasts effective for up to 180 seconds Yi Wu standing casually outside the cage with his hands in his pockets looked at the demon beast and said no matter how precious the Treasures of the secret demon are they will ultimately belong to my clan your lustful nature never changes that's why I set the trap for you to come willingly as expected everything is just as I predicted the secret demon of the DA's treasure yelled in Anger you dare to play with me I will kill you all at that moment land King Yun ran over happily praising y Wu well done y woo SEO G also grinned broadly I told you you're not the type to just stand there waiting for it to escape you're really outstanding yiwu crossed his arms looking seriously at the demon beast and said now is not the time for relaxation its dagger is very tricky and this trap cannot hold for long we must deal with it quickly land King Yun swung his sword gritted his teeth and said give it to me this type it nearly drove me crazy just now Zen Chen raised his hand to Shield the others behind him saying fall back quickly although the defense of the do treasure secret demon was not high it was still a level 65 Elite monster the teen leader used all his strength to strike it down if we stood too close we would be affected everyone agreed to retreat in coordination land King Yun sword swung in a bright Ark the light shining up to the sky with all his power he struck the cage imprisoning the secret demon of the do's treasure completely destroying it with a single blow ah the system announced you have killed the elite of the secret demon of the do treasure earning 200,000 experience points l king Yun as part of the team will receive 5,000

following boss g means making money this Joy spread to yiu as well Yu is excited playfully teasing haha of course suddenly a loud noise echoed drawing everyone's attention with a worried expression C sh G asked him what was that noise Lan King Yun looked towards the source of the sound and confidently said that's the Roar of the boss it seems the door over there has been opened yugu jumped down and said damn it why now he seriously pondered wondering which direction to choose this time should we go grab the boss first or look for the secret demon Lair first y wo and everyone were at a loss troubled about what decision to make what should we do this time the captain quickly analyzed there's no need to worry about this I've heard that the replica of the secret demon lirer is a very special existence As Time inside the lair passes slower than in the real world specifically 1 hour inside the lair is equivalent to about 1 minute outside as for the exact ratio no one knows for sure y Wu quickly made a decision if there's such a mechanism then what's there to hesitate about he opened the large door of the replica and immediately the system provided information about the replica this is a replica of the secret demon Lair of an unclear level so to ensure safety let's be cautious before starting the replica yiu turned to Lan King Yun and asked do you know anything more about the details of this replica for example the level of the demon beasts or any points that need attention l king replied I only know some information related to this replica besides the time mechanism mentioned another piece of information is that the demon beasts in this replica appear randomly y Wu responded if that's the case we'll just have to take it step by step and calculate our moves as we go he began to focus the attention of everyone and encouraged the spirit of the team ahead is an unknown territory and a powerful enemy is waiting for us everyone keep your spirits up and do not not be careless the words of the man inspired everyone to start their fighting Spirit we The Relic Hunters are indeed in search of the unknown existence my body is already tingling haha I can't wait any longer what could be inside even I am a bit looking forward to it l king y was very surprised to see that under Yu's leadership his subordinates had such a passionate fighting Spirit he immediately signaled his men to start the Expedition L woo lead the team then let's set off at that moment a message from the system was received hide the copy secret demon Lair level 35 SEO G exclaimed sarcastically what only level 35 that's a bit disappointing l king Yun quickly spoke to correct him even if it's only level 35 we still don't know much about it we must remain cautious the group continued to move and discovered a cave filled with gold y wo announced don't be disappointed look at what's down there from the Lackey jumping up in excitement he shouted damn there's a pile of gold down there this time we're going to get rich how sh I though a bit excited managed to keep his composure focus on the main mission he thought to himself what an idiot does he only see gold how could he forget that the main point is those secret Demons of the doest treasure Zen Chang also agreed and quickly discovered below there were a total of 15 secret demon of the doest treasure all of which were rare Elites importantly their levels were not too high meaning there was still a chance while everyone was engrossed in analysis C show G interjected so what are we waiting for let's quickly deal with them let me handle the hatred you guys just go all out no need to worry damn it fat guy can you not be so agitated before anyone could stop him C sh G used the protection of the Divine and enhancing his magic and physical resistance extending the time by another 5 minutes the secret demon of the do's treasure were panicking and informing each other that there were Intruders hot-headed sh G quickly challenged all 15 secret demon of the do treasure get through this once for me damn it a number count to blow the chains everyone here is just trash sh G used a move set for crowd control causing his resentment to increase rapidly the secret demon of the do's treasure declared I will skin him and eat his fat as the opponents charged together they encountered a massive technique rays of light appeared like shooting stars accompanied by a whirlwind from Lan King Yun the move set that healed and protected Zing Chang also appeared enabling a barage of attacks and helping him regain the initiative y Wu observed while chuckling what kind of chaotic techniques are these everyone pay attention don't let the attacks affect the central altar go go this time my will also use Firepower not giving the secret demon of the doest treasure any chance to escape hurry up hurry up the secret demons called out to each other in panic but it was too late what is this we're trapped one desperate secret demon exclaimed want to escape dream on kiddos haha Yi Wu Unleashed his ultimate move causing the enemies to fall a fog of smoke enveloped everyone accompanied by choking coughs cough cough cough he added we need to be careful look at how murky it is here cough cough cough bro your Firepower is too excessive ha I'm sorry I just wanted to take him down not letting any secret demon of the do's treasure get away but it's all over now so let's go experience the joy of collecting rewards shall we the whole team moved swiftly to gather their spoils haha so much loot dropped this time it's

experience belong to ywu although I didn't get any equipment that works for me just the several million is enough for a big Harvest moreover their new GE will help improve their combat capabilities which is very important for the next missions thus the first Quest was complete he quickly called everyone GA all right everyone calmed down a bit this is just the appetizer the important part hasn't started yet the big box up there is the real highlight but unfortunately the level of the big box up there was still unknown and the conditions for opening it were also unknown SAA G was curious about the mysterious box and wanted to take the lead in opening it what the hell could this unknown box be a great gift for us how Shu I quickly jumped in let me let me boxes like this are my specialty I think what's inside is definitely not simple Yi wulao stepped forward gripping both of their shoulders to stop them wait don't act rashly do you all remember what the mysterious robe person looked like just now you was both bowing and dancing in front of this box doesn't that seem a bit strange sh G considered his analysis and nodded in agreement hearing you say that it does seem a bit odd perhaps they are performing a ritual or paying homage to this box Zen Chen quickly showcased his wisdom items used for offerings are often something sacred unless this box Captain Lan King Yun also nodded in agreement whether this box is sacred or not in a desolate and remote place like this if we want to open the box we must follow a certain process Yi Wu urged eagerly captain please clarify what the specific process is L King Yun explained first we absolutely cannot approach the unopened box indiscriminately we must ensure that it is not a trap before touching and opening it the whole team was puzzled about what to do with the chest when the captain used a secret demon and violently threw it toward the Box the Box shook violently and then opened revealing a set of sharp teeth that devoured the throne's secret demon indeed inside was a monster named gluttonous nightmare level 90 everyone exclaimed in astonishment and disgust damn it this box looks like the chest from Dark Souls right I've heard about these types of boxes before but this one doesn't seem to be a rare elate the level reaching 90 means this monster box is as formidable as the bosses outside because they are all level 90 l king Yun felt we shouldn't take any more risks and I am satisfied with what we have gotten he spoke up to discourage everyone we are too far away now moreover this trip along with Yu has earned us a lot already being too greedy might just cost us our lives Yu was still silently contemplating and with his hot-headed and battle thirsty nature giving up felt unsatisfactory to show G damn it it's frustrating not to be able to eat the meat right in front of us but there's nothing we can do he said seeing ye we silent and not speaking l king Yun turned to Pat his shoulder wanting to hear his opinion vwu what do you think y Wu remained calm studying the countermeasure which made c g anxious unable to wait any longer that's right Yu we will listen to you Sil sh G added Yu looked at the people approaching his eyes full of Hope which made him a little flustered he scratched his head smiled awkwardly to brush it off and said how about we divide the money from before first huh the whole group was surprised to hear that dispersed and shaking their heads showing a bit of disappointment however the teen leader Lan King Yun found this idea not bad laughing loudly all right that works too let's divide the money first and sort things out later after all having in our pockets will make us feel more at ease this time under the leadership and outstanding ability of ywu the entire group earned a total of 140 million land King Yun suggested so I propose that y will receive half which is 70 million does anyone have any objections everyone happily raised their hands in agreement sh G perhaps the most satisfied with this division proposed by the team leader cheerfully said I completely agree there are no objections whatsoever how Shu I happily agreed without y Wu our trip would probably earn us nothing even the tader Zen Chang nodded in agreement Yu's abilities are the greatest and naturally his contributions are also a largest this 70 million is completely deserved seeing the four people in front of him enthusiastically praising admiring and willing to share more of the profets with him yiu became more confident in their honesty in the face of the temptation of wealth they did not think of colluding to monopolize but instead chose to share half of the income with me indeed yeu did not misjudge this is a team worth trusting and cooperating with for the long term Captain Lan King Yun after receiving everyone's approval began to distribute the profits all right let's decide like this the rest will be split in half I'll keep a portion for now after all everyone just received new weapons and doesn't need to spend much money for the time being this amount is enough for us to use for a long time everyone chimed in together and gave a round of applause to celebrate the victory Yu received a new notification reminding him your account has just been transferred 70 million and reminding you to check again Lan King Yun gathered everyone again and called out we can continue on our journey now let's go all right Captain sh G while walking turned back curiously to ask Yu brother can you now elaborate on how to make some extra money I'm not greedy just want to consider the level of risk involved Yu suddenly stopped walking turned around and looked off into the distance X couldn't hear clearly so be turned back to see Yi Wu standing still gazing regretfully at the chest let's go don't think about that box anymore this isn't a level we can reach right now so stop daydreaming how sh I and Zen Chang continued to discuss the Box why woo this box can really make a lot of money but we can't handle the risk I feel like our luck has run out so we should just give it up that's right it should be called reliable even after hearing the advice y Wu stubbornly moved towards the chest I understand this principle but to miss out on a treasure like this is not my style ye woo could it be that you have another assassin the captain called loudly before the system notified that y Wu had left the team everyone seemed to realize something deep down everyone was questioning Yi woo what are you planning one person asked and Yi wo nodded confirming what everyone was thinking right now it's best for all of you to leave here because the situation could become uncontrollable x g worried that YW would be in danger hurried to stop him kid calm down I can't let you go to your death like this l king Yun realized that what he thought about Yu was correct he is not an ordinary person l king Yun immediately stopped sh G don't say anymore sh G if y Wu has made such a decision he must have prepared for it we cannot compare our standards to his but we can't just leave him behind sh objected as long as we keep our distance so weo cause more trouble for Yu Lan King Yan nodded moreover if there is an emergency we will do our best to rescue Yu the whole team agreed to step back observing yiu with everyone's support yiu felt more confident he laughed loudly haha indeed a reliable team but unexpected emergencies won't happen the system opened a special account called The Shadow King first I have to burn 10 million let's try for 10 seconds to see how twisted this the Shadow King is yiu thought his eyes gleaming with curiosity the system accepted Yu's request and quickly confirmed request received opening please wait a moment nearby Yu's four friends were in a panic Before Their Eyes the spake seemed to be engulfed in a blood red Hue the systems notifications rang out incessantly account count is in the process of merging please wait a moment anxiety was evident on sh G's face he jumped up and shouted what's happening why did the cave suddenly turn Blood Red Land King Yun could not hide or concern either something feels off everyone look at Yu before them the blood from the surrounding demon blood was flowing toward ywu engulfing him yiwu's appearance began to change his hair became long and white as snow attracting a strange swarm of bats that flew in from nowhere to surround him damn it where did these bats come from one person exclaimed the group stared in astonishment at Yu whose appearance continued to alter emanating a strange foul smell this doesn't make sense if it's just a change in appearance why does he radiate such immense pressure is it really y woo why does he exude such an overwhelming stench of blood that it's difficult to breathe four people were observing and debating when the system notification rang out the special Royal account the Shadow King has finished merging countdown Begins the chest shipped violently its lid flying open and a monster appeared attacking Yu its long tongue resembling an octopus tentacle covered in sharp spikes stabbed straight into Yu's chest the system quickly activated the shadow void note of the Shadow King making y Wu immune to any physical damage as the countdown reached 8 seconds the Shadow King let out a growl as Yi Wu concentrated his strength gripping the monster's tongue tightly ignoring the sharp spikes stabbing into him ah Yu shouted refusing to back down seeing that he could not win the monster retreated coiling back and closing the chest lid suddenly the chest turned towards the four people lurking behind damn it that box is pointing at us one person exclaimed Yi Wu was injured on his arm from the spikes on the monster's tongue but the shadow can helped him tear that fearsome tum apart the system announced the six second as ye woo soared up gripping the chest tightly preparing for the second attack he feared that the monster might Target the four people with him everyone look something is stretching out in the blood one person shouted in horror indeed it was true in Yu's blood there seemed to be thousands of monstrous entities as he was in the endless abnormal state of Eternal Blood The Wretched screams of the Beast echoed as it was submerged in yiwu's strange blood zones by the fourth second the level 90 greed Incubus was quickly obliterated in the sea of blood keep sleeping forever in my blood the shadow came declared in the final moments the system notification finished the countdown of 10 seconds and prepared to dissolve the fusion at that moment the swarm of bats surrounding yuu began to scatter an excruciating pain surged through him as strange hands emerged tearing away the red blood zones enveloping his body Yu groaned it hurts so much this feeling is even more terrifying than when I Dr drank the Hercules power Elixir before the pain gradually subsided and Y Wu knelt down gasping for breath despite feeling a bit self- reproachful he couldn't help but chuckle haha even if my body doesn't lose control I still can't bear the responsibility of the Shadow cane in just 10 seconds such immense damage but still the power of the Shadow cane truly does not disappoint me Yu looked down at his hands murmuring in less than 10 seconds I easily kill the level 90 Elite Beast if my body can withstand this power then that level 90 boss is nothing the system announced achievement unlocked Treasure Chest Terminator not being consumed by resources but consuming resources defeated the rare elite Beast greed Incubus earned 500,000 experience points experience gained 200 million the obtained items appeared Tristan's dragon slayer sword a specialized sword for assassinating dragon

are a multitude of legendary level items truly worthy of the treasure chest beasts Tong level 90 winning these rewards took considerable effort say G just regaining his senses clumsily got up and looked at Yu asking in Surprise what just happened I only lost Focus for a moment and you defeated the treasure chest BEAST's tongue level Mindy already haui also scratched his head not understanding what had just happened I can only see a pile of red when I reluctantly open my Eagle Eye this speed is really abnormal Captain Lan King Yun hurriedly supported y Wu concerned as he asked how are you y Wu with Lan King Yun helping him stand up Yu felt weak completely out of strength he replied not so good Zing Chen quickly searched for more information in the item he received earlier this weeken pen tip seems to be able to be dispelled let me try the system announced the soul state has shattered has been dispelled feeling his body gradually recovering Yu happily sat down to rest it really has been dispelled what a stroke of luck it seems the pen tip does not limit its properties after Fusion all thanks to Zen Chang's analytical assistance he turned to express his gratitude thank you for saving my life Zen Chang raised his hand to lightly push his glasses up smiling modestly it was just a coincidence l king Yun also leaned in from behind and Dred his arm over yiu shoulder asking curiously vwo what exactly happened just now Yu quickly changed the topic let's not talk about that for now I have something I want to ask you regarding the level 90 Fortress construction blueprint what do you know about it when youu asked about the blueprint Lan King yun's eyes suddenly lit up he spoke with excitement this blueprint is not just any construction blueprint for an important stronghold is it this blueprint is extremely rare how could you obtain this blueprint truly a legendary reputation seeing Lan King Yun intently gazing at the blueprint and praising it y woot was also very curious it doesn't seem like an ordinary type is it a blueprint for building a house what makes it so rare Lan King Yun was silent for a moment organizing his words before explaining clearly the houses of important strongholds are fundamentally different from ordinary houses for ordinary houses as long as you have strength and courage you can build them anywhere in desolate areas but important strongholds must be constructed on a special map what is a special map YW asked the system began to illustrate with images according to Lan King yunk explanation indeed important strongholds are of a special type with requirements that are completely different from ordinary Maps if you are lucky the location may have a beautiful landscape like a fair land but if you are unfortunate it could be a scene of hopeless apocalypse like a prison for humans is it that different ywu was surprised is this really still an era that requires luck seeing y Wu looking somewhat confused Captain Lan King Yun continue to explain however regardless of the special map requirements the role of an important base remains unchanged you can use it as your personal exclusive territory a place to explore build a fortress gather resources recruit teammates and even establish a professional battle team saell G who was usually hot-headed immediately injected exclusive personal territory damn it this is not some important base it's clearly a Herm let me advise you the benefits here are not something you can hold on to let me help you with that meanwhile how shoua curiously asked how much is that blueprint worth since it's such a rare top tier blueprint it must be very valuable how much money can it make l king Yun turned to the two of them signaling for silence before answering seriously it's not like that although indeed if we consider its Rarity this blueprint is very valuable the threshold for its use is too high only a top Master Craftsman can utilize it therefore fundamentally it has no market value you SE sh G frowned still looking puzzled huh is it possible that this level of blueprint can only be crumpled in hand and not Ed what a Pity ywu suddenly realized that this blueprint looked very familiar isn't this the blueprint that I created for Nana he wondered it seems this Advanced manufacturing blueprint isn't exactly widely circulated but if I look at it from another angle could I possibly take advantage of this seeing that y wo was still too focused on thinking about the blueprint in vain sh G patted his shoulder reassuringly don't dwell on it too much my brother this is just one thing among many haven't you already gathered quite a few Treasures this time you surely not come away empty-handed y Wu forced a smile it's not that I haven't come away empty-handed it's that I've earned it through sweat and tears at that moment suddenly the transaction interface of everyone appeared an announcement rang out what do you want to do y woo y wo quickly regained his Focus raised his hand and interacted with the system this is all the items from the monster box that dropped aside from the blueprint and the million everyone could choose whatever they like I'll gift everything to you all four of them rejoiced touched lifting their generous teammate vwoo you're really generous indeed I've not misjudged this brother of mine who I've never respected anyone except the boss you were the second person all right hurry up and choose we still have other things to do Sho G said Lan King Yun patted guu on the shoulder expressing his deep appreciation if there's anything we need from you in the future just let us know your business is our business although I said might be a bit insincere we are very serious about it yiu smiled and replied I know the captain reminded everyone while choosing items hurry up and choose for me remember to only pick things that you need each person can only choose one it am we are not a bunch of greedy Little People how shui laughed and said don't worry boss there's no way we can play ye woo an hour later the whole team had moved to a new location x g excitedly exclaimed ah the outdoor air is really Pleasant l king Yun turned and curiously asked Yi Wu what's the next step do you have any plans Yi Wu thought for a moment and replied um I have a plan sa G who was attentive admiring the scenery suddenly inquired vwo what plan is it couldn't be a way to earn more money Yi Wu nodded the small goal I mentioned before was to take everyone to defeat bosses to earn 100 million however after the previous Harvest exceeded expectations I'm not sure if everyone is willing to continue taking risks now Captain Lan King Yun greatly admired YW considering him a brother of the team and sincerely confiding in him yiu spoke candidly right now the main issue is whether you still need us or not because your strength has already surpassed what we have in mind if you still need us we will not refuse to follow you if you see us as a burden we will leave immediately the boss was not wrong the others also chined in in agreement with the captain's words all waiting for yi Wu's answer even though he was moved by these words yiu approached patted Lan King y on the shoulder and said frankly of course I need you all you were the most important pieces on my chessboard everyone was shocked at a loss for words not fully understanding the meaning behind yiu statement he continued to explain Although our ultimate goal is to defeat the boss knowing how to work together within the team is what is truly challenging therefore having many pieces to use will make our strategies even richer respecting Yu's boldness and accountability the captain burst into laughter haha I like your straightforwardness to express such a thing so honestly and up brightly is impressive Sao G was not upset by Yu's words on the contrary he happily accepted I truly did not misjudge the person as I said there is a certain special aura about you zing Chang was also unembarrassed to admit if it were someone else who said that I would have already injected demon magic all over their face but you I willingly choose to be your Pawn Yu was very excited to hear everyone's heartfelt words that's great but everyone can rest assured word under my command you will not become an Expendable Pawn a shocking sound echoed and they immediately realized what was happening nearby land King Yun pointed towards the source of the loud noise the boss battle over there has begun Yu turned and asked what is your plan now should we join the fight not yet Let Them Fight For A While y ordered the system the system activated the true eye skill currently in use noticing that both sides had begun to take their position for battle y Wu was very enthusiastic ah the main character has made an appearance so the real show is about to start returning a few minutes ago the world boss redtail Devil Dragon was summoned Juan T and key said no wonder it's a legend destroying several cities and towns in myth seeing it with my own eyes it truly is a big shot its reputation is welld deserved worthy of a fight liuan how warned the opponent is a level 90 World boss and a green dragon level why Sue do not let your guard down son yancha arrogantly replied I don't care if it's a boss or not I am the one who will take down the boss Chen Chen also responded I will definitely support everyone Yin Juan calmly said Focus your attention and follow my orders the redtail Devil Dragon angered by the hero group invading its territory said insignificant humans disturbing my peace do you realize your crime Yin huan chuckled lightly and responded to it I did not expect a beast with such high intellect to learn how to speak so well however I did not come here to chat with you if we are talking about crimes your charges could fill a book The redtail Devil Dragon furiously responded you ignorant ants you are seeking your own demise the redtail Devil Dragon used its skill fire demon aiming directly at the heroes yinan and Li you and how both quickly dodged the attack at the same time Yin V ordered her team pay attention to how it attacks and don't act recklessly Li Yuan how agreed replying got it immediately afterwards he was unexpectedly attacked by the redtail Devil Dragon seemingly noticing something he whispered the force of this move in an instant he activated the defensive skilled Diamond Shield the key was to hold firm and not move the protective Spirit of Life activated he braced himself for a direct hit from the red tailed Devil Dragon he took on massive damage the strength causing him to cry out H so heavy hang tan key was taken aback by the damage that Direct Hit dealt to lie Yuan how he angrily said was that just now a lethal blow moreover Yuan how's Health in an instant was completely depleted liuan how tiredly continued this boss is too cunning attack attacking like that luckily I reacted in time Yin Ruan was pleased with his quick reflexes and resilience she said well done if you hadn't mitigated the damage that hit just now would have definitely been fatal after that she rallied her teammates Focus all your spirit on me we are going to take down the boss its skills and fighting style are still unknown don't be careless and risk losing your lives the entire Council understood youan how thank Chen Shen for for her timely support he said your assistance was also very timely thank you she happily replied no need to thank me everyone keep pushing forward I will do my best to help you all get back into the fight at that moment everyone screamed in panic as they saw the red tailed Devil Dragon use its breath skill once again then song yunga calmly executed a skill to interrupt the Demon's ability the breath fire was successfully interrupted confirming a cool down time of 30 seconds everyone joyfully shouted well done Yin Ruan called for her teammates to attack the boss's initial phase probably consists of these skills so DPS should do their best to pressure its Health the red tailed Devil Dragon let out a painful Roar the entire team shouted in unison understood suddenly the red tailed Devil Dragon roared Yin rulan realized in Surprise wait a minute the boss's movements have changed again that Roar this might be the summon how skill that the boss often uses it can attract Elite beasts within a 100 m radius to come to its Aid these monsters are all Elite Beasts of the hybrid type Yin Juan continued now with only 80% Health left it might transition to the little demon phase huan tan K angrily said how can it be so Shameless Yin huan ordered Yuna you tell the people from tyen chuang to prepare for battle immediately liuan how received the order and responded clearly at the same time outside the battle range with the boss the teammates reported to TA Reni the captain just now the Mong team sent a message for us to prevent the monsters from coming from outside he replied anxiously yinon is really something else it's only been a few minutes and she's already changed phases the second announcement team three immediately choose a location to intercept the enemy he continued remember it's just to intercept the enemy not to kill try to keep the monster's Health above 50% now is not the time to execute the plan the main thing is to buy time wait until the boss's Health drops to 10% then we can act the teams all acknowledged the order after that he turned to the mysterious figure and said now you guys don't need to take action wait for my signal the mysterious figure replied haha no problem but don't keep us waiting too long back to the battle yin huan and her teammates had reduced the boss's Health by 50% she noticed that the boss's defense had been raised Chan Kai angrily reported damn it we can't reduce its Health any further Yuna added even though we've taken down 50% it's indeed a bit taxing for the five of us to challenge the world boss Chen Chen worriedly replied I'm sorry I've dragged everyone down you and H replied no it's not that sha Chen performed very well but continuing like this will indeed not be okay the boss's Health Cannot drop any further and our magic power and supplies will run out sooner or later Yan hurriedly called cow Ren G we're encountering problems over here you all quickly send a squad to support us right away but the voice on the other end replied no way there are too many monsters we don't have enough people over here he angrily cursed you group of useless things can't even handle a bunch of little demons from behind Yu appeared lightly saying it's not that they are useless they simply don't want to help you at all moreover they are hoping that you all die quickly Yuna threw a weapon directly towards Yi Wu while saying who's pretending to be a ghost over there hurry up and get out of here yiu easily caught Yan's attack with his hand then said don't be so Fierce anymore handsome didn't I remind you to remember me well why have you forgotten so quick or are you pretending to be foolish to deal with me as he spoke he crushed a chunk of ice I had good intentions to come help you without saying anything and suddenly being ambushed by you like this is not acceptable song yancha was shocked to see y Wu it's you why are you here is this where you should be hurry up and get lost don't come here to make a nuisance of yourself Yin Ruan shouted Yuma don't mind him focus on me but in her distraction she took damage from the monster the whole team was worried luckily yiu appeared behind her shuing her he said how can you be so careless Yin H young lady this is the boss fight we should cooperate he continued moreover I took the risk to bring you important intelligence shouldn't you thank me she just smiled and asked back intelligence you mean the Genesis team is planning to betray us haha it seems like you've overestimated them Yin went on even if they had 10 guts they wouldn't dare to plot against me at this critical moment y Wu thought to himself seems like the people from The Genesis team hit the nail on the head in the end she still chose to drive y Wu away all right I've accepted your good will now leave here quickly this is not a place for you to stay yigu replied I'll leave when I achieve my goal young xia sneered the purpose huh I see the only purpose for you staying here is to seek death Yu retorted this isn't the time to spout nonsense let's do something more practical and I'll help you guys deal with the boss afterward I just need three parts from the boss drops Yuna shouted what is he trying to be funny tyen Ki added Captain let us handle this arrogant trash talking guy it won't take much time 3 seconds is all it takes after hearing you woo Yin Ruan replied disappointedly I thought you were interesting but now you're acting all arrogant and causing a ruckus which is really disappointing you who continued I'll give you 5 Seconds to get out of my sight if not when the boss fight starts and things go out of control don't blame me for the consequences not even a young lady can pin it on me after hearing Yin Juan's warning Yu cly replied is that so he thought to himself now I suppose I'm acting like a gentleman if there's no possibility of cooperation then don't blame me for being ruthless he smiled and bid farewell to Yin Ban's team then I wish you all the best in leaving after leaving his words left a clear sense of worry in Chen Chen's mind she asked Captain will the people from The Genesis team really betray us is it possible that y sha interrupted her are you so foolish have you let that trash mess with your mind if you believe his lies he'll achieve his goal Yin buan added that's right our first Target now is the boss you all just need to give it your all for me don't worry about other things the whole team responded in unison at that moment on the other side of the battlefield the Genesis team was being overwhelmed the number of soldiers reported to TA Ren G the squad over here is about to collapse C Ren G shouted no they must hold on who am I supposed to hold accountable here he thought what's going on clearly before the battle with the boss began we had dealt with a group of elite beasts in the nearby area why after fighting for so long are there even more this won't do if it continues like this sooner or later the team will be destroyed he shouted stop fighting so weakly give it your all don't let it be the case that when the boss is not even at 10% our people are all dead the whole team responded in unison to the order at that moment C show G who was observing the battle from outside said haha luckily I pulled monster away this time it's enough for the Genesis team to have a full meal how Shou added yei how's tactic from yiu is indeed just lucky Jen Chen commented in this level of battle what we fear the most is the unexpected and chaotic monster appearances which are uncontrollable l king Yun nodded in agreement that's right because of that YW combat method must avoid chaos and also create chaos we just need to sit back and wait for the Harvest up front the situation for the the Genesis team was getting increasingly dangerous a worried member said this is bad boss I can't hold out anymore among the 10 people in our free squads only six are left now there are too many Elite beasts if this continues we might end up dying here upon hearing this Reni shouted loudly towards the emperor team aren't you guys going to hurry over to help it's no benefit to you if we lose the mysterious figures revealed their identities they were subordinate of the emperor team Fang your life or death has nothing to do with me he continued our goal from the beginning to the end has been the special forces team and the boss if you want to blame someone you can only blame yourselves for being useless unable to even handle the small matter C Reni was so angry that he stammered you guys he thought to himself fortunately I had already anticipated that this group of assassination squads from the emperor was unreliable amble I can only proceed with the plan if those guys are ruthless don't blame me for being ungrateful he went on with the plan and ordered everyone run around in the world boss battle carry out the plan first a team member asked back but Captain the boss's health is only at 30% our plan he continued engage in battle our lives are already at stake why care about that plan if we can't obtain it that none of the others should dream of getting it the Assassin team watched as the Genesis team rushed into the boss battle a subordinate asked Captain those workless Genesis guys are desperate should we intervene to stop them from causing chaos he stood still and replied no need our superiors assigned us the task of prioritizing weakening the Special Operations team as for the boss if it can be taken then take it if not doesn't matter he continued so as long as Yin guan's team is wiped out we will complete the mission if by chance they don't die we just need to go up and kill them back on the battlefield Yin Ruan called on her teammates to pay attention to the fight she said the boss's attack power is getting stronger if we're not careful we could lose our lives easily at the same time the scream from the Genesis team rang out help lady Yin Juan there are too many Elite Beast monsters we can't hold on any longer Yuna shouted angrily Ken G who told you to lure Elite Beast monsters to our location get the hell away from here right now Yin huan angrily said it's just a fake death device and you dare to play tricks in front of me it seems Yu didn't lie at all the entire team spoke in unison don't mind that guy anymore Captain she and her teammates were extremely worried we are surrounded now what should we do Yin juu ordered the whole team follow my orders don't panic Hold Your Position positions and don't disrupt the formation Yuan how and Chen Shen use all your strength to hold boss no matter what you must persist for 30 seconds young sha TN ke let's join forces to eliminate the small monsters use all our powerful skills the team responded loudly and clearly understood tyen key kicked off the battle unleashing a barage of bullets at the swarm of monsters Yun shell cast Frozen hundreds of miles over a wide range freezing the surrounding monsters Yin Juan darted like a flash of lightning slicing the monsters into pieces all three put forth their utmost effort Tian key out of breath and having used all his powerful moves said it is indeed a bit exhausting young sha immediately replied after that all the beasts that came to Aid were killed but my man of value is running low now Yin moan seeing this quickly adjusted the formation don't waste time hurry back to reinforce after reminding the formation Yin Hulan took steps toward Ren G not forgetting to leave a warning Ren G pretend to be lying on the ground as for you you probably know the outcome of betraying us right but he can only lie there his mouth unable to protest damn it no way it wasn't easy for us to lead the elite beasts in only to be killed so easily by them how have I completely underestimated your strength it's over this time we've truly lost everything calm down the boss is still alive right now Yin Ruan probably won't take action against us anymore moreover the people from Team Emperor haven't act yet I still have hope for victory a shrill scream rang out Yin Hulan was surprised and turned around it was Chen shenk's voice what happened as it turns out Chen Shen was ambushed and severely injured by a subordinate from the Huang xen group despicable taking advantage of my ungard Ed moments to attack me he stood there observing Chen Shen in critical condition haha stepping onto the battlefield is just a matter of life and death what does it matter if it's despicable or not Y and Hal saw this and immediately shouted loudly Chen Chan you bunch of beasts how dare you Ambush our Mong team another member of the emperor team quickly approached and ambushed Yan how do you still have time to worry about others unfortunately for Yuan how he couldn't Dodge in time and was struck by the knife in his right chest leaving him with only 20% Health chin Kai saw this and panicked Chen Shen damn Yan how Yun witnessing this couldn't help but feel anxious it's those subordinates of hang Jen group again the hidden Fang specializes in assassinating them at that moment Yin buan immediately shouted to regroup stop being stunned you to drag the boss away from beside Ben Shen and Yuan how no matter what it takes you must hold on for 20 seconds for me the entire team responded in unison understood the subordinates of hang Jen group also surge forward simultaneously haha as expected of one of the Trump cards of the team mongin in this moment of danger you remain calm however the situation is now beyond control your healing and tanking capabilities are all rendered useless every one has used up their major skills do you still have any tricks left to change the situation seeing the situation Yin hoan quickly deduced the whole matter so it is hidden Fang of hang Jang no wonder tyen chuang has the guts to betray so that's why you are backing them up one of the members from the Huang Jen group replied as long as you die here no one will know about today's events the outside world will only know that lady Yin Juan at the Mong team died at the hands of the boss in area 9 such beautiful looks so pitiful what a Pity Yin huan calmly responded holding Heavenly demon in her hand this is the legendary quality magic Crystal let me give you a piece of advice only defeating your opponent under your feet will make it effective Yin Mo crushed the Heavenly demon and swallowed it whole suddenly her whole body emitted an extremely strong light Yin huan had entered a new state leveling up to 115 activating the Heavenly demon courtz State the duration lasted for 30 seconds the Heavenly demon quartz used with Heavenly demon can enhance the Heavenly demon courts level by 30 levels but using Heavenly demon skills last for 30 seconds the members of the Huang Jing group were immediately alarmed how is this possible how could your level increase by 30 levels Bring it on I don't believe it four level 8es can't handle you alone before they could react suddenly a beam of light flashed by they it moved as fast as Lightning in less than a second Yin Hanan had Unleashed her ultimate skill the Heavenly demon technique in the blink of an eye she easily took down the entire gang of the Hang xen group their numbers were nothing but ants one lucky member managed to escape using an optical stealth skill damn it this woman is really freakish I didn't see this coming I can't believe she has a secret ultimate skill we have to retreat to the base and regroup with the world boss the red tailed Devil Dragon swung its tail towards Tian K and Yuna I'm done for all the potions on me are gone this time I'm really out of Tricks young thought he would die on this battlefield damn it are we really going to die here today fortunately Yin hu arrived just in time to take the hit for her teammates seeing the new form of their Captain Yan sha asked Captain does this form mean Yin huan did not explain but immediately ordered you all hurry up withdraw Chen Shen and Yan how within 10 seconds if I haven't dealt with the boss by then you all just run but without hesitation Yin Huen stood directly in front of the monster hurry up all three replied yes Yin huan chose to confront the boss directly she Unleashed a critical hit on the head of the red tailed Devil Dragon the monster let out a howl of Agony and its health bar dropped to only 10% the Beast went perer wrapping its tail tightly around yinan she was immediately immobilized I'm dead now my health is low the monster entered a raging State the red tailed Devil Dragon let out a roar That Shook the heavens the red tailed Devil Dragon soared into the sky taking Yin Hanan along with it high above the red tailed Devil Dragon lashed out with its tail throwing Yin Hanan down to the ground with great force die human yinan fell from the sky at this moment nothing occupied her mind except death for she realized the time for the Heavenly demon quartz had arrived damn it just a little bit more is this finally my turn to die suddenly a hand reached out to catch her it turned out to be Yoo why you look so miserable after just a short while then Yin Wu spread his wings to embrace Yin Juan should you consider my previous proposal a bit but now the price has gone up for this boss I want everything gin ran shouted at Yu's face what are you fussing about can't you understand besides what time is it now that you're thinking about money are you someone who needs money more than your life yiu replied with a smile only the weak choose between life and money I want it all he embraced yinan and slammed down causing the ground to shatter this show of strength caused a crack to form on one side of Yin Juan's mask revealing her face as beautiful as a fairy upon seeing this ye W teased oh the portrait beneath this mask is truly stunning everyone around gasped in Surprise what Yuna witnessing this exclaimed the captain's mask fell off time key added even within the team we have never seen the captain's true face Y and how curious chimed in I want to see too Yin huan quickly Broke Free from yiwu's hold shouting let me go yiu continued to tease clearly you look very beautiful why hide it Such a Pity for this enchanting Beauty young s feeling envious remarked that detestable y woo how comes he alone gets to see the captain's true face so annoying Yin huan quickly regained her composure and loudly addressed her teammates is this really the time to discuss such things gin huan turned to ywu and said don't think that just because you've saved me you can be smug and forget your Yin Hulan looked up at the boss and continued the boss may only have 3% Health left but right now it is in a burer state plus our team has exhausted all its strength and can no longer continue fighting instead of bickering here we might as well think of a way to escape while it hasn't launched an attack yet Yu seeing this said isn't that a good thing Yu was firm so you can't make a move to claim the boss for yourselves right then this boss belongs solely to me Yin hanan's companions were surprised by Yu's words tan ke immediately said this kid isn't afraid is he not an idiot Ken Chen feeling unfair chimed in but judging by his demeanor he doesn't seem to be joking yon XA said Li woo you are too Arrogant with your pathetic skills what right do you have to be boastful in front of us you still want to claim the boss haha go ahead but you'll have to hold on for a while so we can have time to escape a mocking voice came from behind being part of a competitive team yet having such a narrow view it turns out you're just a relic Hunter King Yun immediately said on the battlefield being arrogant and underestimating the enemy will get you killed moreover Yu's strength cannot be judged by Common standards Yan XA then shouted insults at the artifact hunting team a bunch of servants dare to come and teach me how to work arrogance and underestimation are really your traits I'm actually interested in seeing how you will defeat the boss or if the boss will take care of you how sh I responded vigorously to Yan's sarcasm how formidable is a professional team without Captain Yu your beauty would have long turned into a pile of minced meat XA G was not willing to back down either that's right there's no hacking involved just wait and see how y w will deal with all of you zing Chang seeing this quickly intervened to silence his two boastful companions shut it already after all they are a professional team let's keep a bit of dignity for them I'm really sorry these two guys are just used to talking trash please forgive them but it seems you misunderstand something Zen Chen continued we came just to watch the one taking action will be Yoo suddenly a flash of light and a streak of red lightning erupted shooting out all around behind yancha startling him it turned out to be yiwu who had changed into a different more terrifying fighting State everyone was bewildered by this drastic transformation unable to believe is this really ywo Yin muan was also incredibly surprised feeling that this pressure was even stronger than that of the boss impossible how could y wo possess such tremendous power a strong gust of energy swept over the professional battle team how can this be they wondered the boss the bizarre red tailed Devil Dragon showed no sign of under underestimating y Wu's immense strength such power I will respond with all my might the boss roared beginning to gather strength my strongest move is about to be Unleashed in the boss's frenzied State suddenly the server announced please note master that this attack is of the dark magic attribute it can be absorbed but excessive absorption will lead to injury everyone was once again astonished by yiwu's power his cloak can absorb damage how can that be yiu began to channel his strength a red Aura enveloped him growing thicker and thicker surrounding yiu completely and forming a massive sphere what is he trying to do everyone wondered why is he wrapping himself up into his sphere the power grew stronger and stronger and the sphere was expanding rapidly moreover from inside the sphere strange sounds emerged seemingly the growl of a beast suddenly a large hand with sharp claws emerged from the orb moments later the orb completely vanished revealing the true form of Yu which was a dragon damn it he has transformed into a dragon everyone around was panicking at this terrifying transformation of Y wo Al it's still y wo one person exclaimed the pressure and Aura of yiu at this moment completely suppressed the boss the boss in front of him seemed like a junior nothing more the red tailed Devil Dragon felt flustered why does this energy feels so familiar who exactly are you in his Dragon form Yu replied what does the boss have to do with you just a junior yet to awaken unworthy to know my name after saying that the dragon bit down hard delivering a fatal blow to the shoulder of the red tailed Devil Dragon causing it to cry out in pain the two dragons were battling in the sky with lightning tearing apart the very fabric of the air the massive red dragon had quickly gained the upper hand this scene left everyone in all ah This Magnificent battle scene with our level we will probably never encounter it in our lifetime I knew he was extraordinary before but I didn't expect him to be extraordinary to this extent howu shouted fatty you've picked up a treasure so sha couldn't contain his excitement haha he can actually turn into a dragon y Wu is super slay go on bite that damn boss to death the people from M Kong's team were going to friend how is this possible I must be seeing things how can his strength be greater than the bosses it's like cheating like hacking where can I buy this hack I'll pay any price Chen Chen admiringly asked Yin Juan sister Yin have you ever encountered a boss of this scale it's really incredible she pondered for a moment then said I've encountered stronger ones than this but this is the first time I've seen a human able to fight against a boss like this no even unilaterally being trampled she put her hands on her hips internally thinking now I finally understand why the young lady is fond of you but clearly possessing such Fierce strength why you have no reputation whatsoever who exactly are you C Ren G was still lying down pretending to be dead yet was astonished by the scene damn what background does that kid have is he going to Sol the boss could he be the secret weapon of mong's Team stop pretending to be dead and find an opportunity to prepare to run away T renji thought the members of the Huang Jen group while escaping cursed at Yin Juan that's enough of being perverse there's actually someone more Twisted than her what are you still fighting for although the mission has failed it's not in vain to come here that kit must be reported to the leaders for attention the redtail Devil Dragon intending to lure said this feeling of blood connection could it be that you have devoured My Tribe member inheriting its Dragon power if you possess such Mighty strength why would you still choose to be human why not join the Beast faction we can all enjoy the thrill of slaughtering humans together as soon as he finished speaking he was swiftly dealt with by The Red Dragon only able to scream ah the red dragon glared in disdain uninterested the level 90 red tailed Devil Dragon was officially defeated the crowd below cheered yeah he just got killed like that suddenly the red dragon roared releasing massive waves of light Roar the team below began to sense something unusual and said damn it that's amazing but that Roar is no different from a Sonic attack brother you're not losing your mind and starting to attack everyone are you don't do that the dragons seemed to be losing strength hurrying towards the crowd and causing them to panic it said what do you want to do this is not good it's starting to attack us Yin Juan's team quickly got into position preparing to fight son Yuna spoke up quick get out of here Captain he's gone crazy we basically can't fight back now Liu and how also reminded Lan King yun's team if you all want to live you better run even though they didn't know if it would help unexpectedly how shou's group made a bold decision We Trust Yu no doubt about it the swirling blood covered the entire space Yin Van's group really couldn't understand the actions of Lan kin yun's team only saying a bunch of fools just waiting to be drowned by these bloody waves the red streams of blood gradually separated and Yu appeared in the center behind him was a gate sucking all the bloody waves into it he said how could I do something so irrational no need to panic everything is under my control how Shu I and see x g were amazed V Woo you're so cool incredibly manly too handsome in this world how can there be a man more handsome than me howu l king Yun scratched his head in annoyance you guys don't bother Yu anymore after such a big battle he must be very tired Zen Chang quickly flipped through the spell book and summoned a healing wind yiu had used up a lot of energy his body trembled slightly but he calmly replied don't worry I'm fine I can still hold on the system sent a notification system calculating this battle took 60 seconds deducting 60 million as the dragon transformation was used costing 1 billion a total of 1.6 billion will be deducted from the master's account inside he was screaming and crying uncontrollably I can understand compensating for the time wasted but even using a big move requires a separate fee this battle wasn't worth it normally I could have gotten through just fine but this time if it weren't for my luck encounter with the treasure chess monster I wouldn't have dared to expend so much wastefulness is not a long-term plan SAA G ran over and threw an arm around him asking are you okay brother he replied I'm fine just that my heart is bleeding even though the result is very good but Lan King Yun still cautiously reminded him truly impressive y woo congratulations on successfully defeating the boss just that such showy actions should still be approached with more caution he continued on this battlefield who knows how many eyes are on you although your nature is transcendant you still have to be cautious Yi Wu agreed saying that's right I will pay attention I've also reminded myself to be more careful before taking action in the future Lan King Yun chuckled lightly no wonder you were the Elder in the Marshal world with so much experience I really need to be more mindful after all this was not an enclosed domain dungeon land King Yun glanced towards the footsteps gradually approaching from behind her then said see just talking about it trouble has come is the Mong team trying to take advantage of others danger here to snatch the items that the boss drops I won't allow you to touch anything even if I have to risk my life Yi Wu and Yin hon both spoke up to clarify whoever kills the boss gets what's theirs Mong team we are not so despicable as to act like that I am here to a apologize to yiu for underestimating you in front of the young lady you were the first person I misjudged and now I am sincerely Earnest she extended her hand towards yiu I invite you to join the Mong team do you agree seeing her decision tyan key Yan how and Chen Chang couldn't help but Express their surprise simultaneously exclaiming Captain are you serious you have never actively invited anyone to join the team before youan Hal suddenly said until now only the captain would chase away those who don't meet the standards today they are making an exception for him he's really lucky Chen Chen seeing that he was the one who joined couldn't help but feel Joy raising his hands and saying but with your strength it's true that you can receive this honor unlike the excitement of others only Yun cha felt uncomfortable because Yin hang was the person he liked and Yi Wu had taken advantage of the situation by seizing the boss's Bounty with a 5x7 hit as well as being invited to the team biker jealousy made him speak up I object just now the boss we attacked had only 3% Health left he merely took advantage we haven't even pursued the responsibility for him snagging the boss let alone welcoming this person into the team seeing him raise an objection sh G roughly pointed his finger at him and shouted what are you talking about 3% Health what do you mean by taking advantage even if the ball had full health y Wu could easily take it down don't underestimate others being scolded like that Yan sha refused to back down his anger boiling as he retorted Dan Fatso it's not your turn to speak here not letting him finish the captain Yin huan shouted loudly enough seeing Yuna not acknowledging Yu's strength yinu turned back and said as a member of the Mong team can't you recognize Yu's true power don't embarrass others here unless you want to be kicked out of the team by me Yan sha wanted to say something but dared not he stammered Captain I feel like you are favoring y wo he was indignant but didn't dare to speak further in his heart he truly felt a deep-seated jealousy towards Yi Wu Furious but could only keep it bottled up thinking of course I can see that this kiddo's strength is terrifying but I can't accept a Shameless arrogant kid who knows only how to act why should someone like him possess such great power why does the goddess in my heart value him the more he thought the more uncomfortable he became gritting his teeth in frustration because if I were to act against gwu now the one who would suffer the most would be me so he could only contain his anger within and continue to silently curse y woo remember this one day I will find a way and make you pay in response to his captain Yin Juan's enthusiasm y Wu awkwardly scratched his head and said thank you for your kindness but as you already know I have decided to establish my own team so I'm sorry although I was quite disappointed with your answer this is what I expected I knew you would say that she said sighing softly but it's all right everyone is a part of the hanmo group she extended her hand towards him her voice calm I hope we can collaborate joyfully in the future Yu was surprised by this change thinking to himself incred inedible this person who didn't like me before has now changed her attitude 180° after seeing my strength this woman is so genuine that she can't hide it he shook her hand his tone polite I dare not I dare not we are just a newly established team it's an honor for us to be taken care of by the Mong team Yi Wu smiled telling himself I prefer this strong and genuine demeanor over any pretentious weakness suddenly she rushed to hug him catching him off guard unable to escape he could only awkwardly say Miss Yin Juan it seems you have already developed feelings for yiu she leaned close to his ear and whispered you saved me today I won't forget this favor how do you want me to repay you hearing this he calmly replied no rush no rush let's wait until I need young lady Yin Juan's help in the future to disgust it she still held him her voice gentle do you want me to owe you this favor first that's fine fine although I usually hate this kind of thing the most if the person is you I can accept it it can be seen that she particularly cares about him willing to break all principles just for him she let go walked toward her teammates then turned back and smiled then we will go ahead goodbye he waved goodbye as well bye-bye in his heart he thought the women of hanmo group are truly not simple after mong's team left sh G and how shuai couldn't contain their excitement their eyes shining praising vwoo you really have a relationship with Yin Guan how enviable you are my idol the saying is very true beautiful women are only for the strong this saying describes you perfectly seeing the two so enthusiastic yiu smiled and replied you two are exaggerating Lan King Yun approached looking at him curiously I didn't expect you to be from hanmo group I thought you were a Lone Ranger seeing the opponent quite surprised yiu immediately explained I just joined not long ago so I'm not very close with their people yet Lan King Yun looked at him and reminded as far as I remember Han Mo will take away 50% of the benefits of the team this means that after joining everything you acquire must be handed over half like this time you fought the Boss by yourself and hanm mo didn't help at all so isn't that a huge loss knowing that Lan King Yun was not wrong Yugi smiled awkwardly and replied it's okay this is something unavoidable I joined hanm mainly because of my family after all in the apocalyptic era it's very difficult for me to manage everything by myself although he said that he couldn't help but feel a little heartbroken and thought to himself when I get back I should ask Moi the team's secretary if it can reduce the percentage I have to pay around 5 to 10% for example hearing him say that l king Yun immediately understood Ah that's how it is you are not like us those orphans living in the wild not having to worry about anyone we just need one person to be full and the whole family does not worry about Hunger but you still have family finding a solid support is also a reasonable choice however with your strength I think you won't want to rely on others for too long he thought if there's a chance one should still build their own power land King Yun suddenly remembered something and said said to him didn't you have a blueprint for a base before I recall there's a construction master within the handm mo group you should try befriending him when the time comes to develop the base you can arrange for your family to settle in and then you can feel at ease ye W noted thinking to himself this is indeed a good suggestion he smiled and replied that's a good proposal then he suddenly remembered MOSI the mad scientist he used to know after thinking for a moment y would told himself I don't necessarily need to beg others I can do it myself as well at that moment the AI robot viz also appeared speaking humorously he that's right building a base or whatever is nothing for the omnipotent Master ending the conversation y Wu looked at everyone let's go let's see what Loop this boss dropped upon seeing the dropped items sh G exclaimed joyfully oh it's time to pick up some Treasures system notification you have killed the world boss red tailed Devil Dragon you have gained 400,000 experience you have received 1.2 billion in rewards heart of the Devil Dragon the dragon heart is still beating vigorously very powerful its effects may not be clear yet but it seems to be usable for cooking the system reported residue of light Legend has it that the red tailed Devil Dragon was once a Divine Dragon this is the ash left behind before it fell into the devil Dragon Yu read the description of the item silently he continued to examine the other things in his hand Dragon ey ring when worn the Magic in the ring will help the user maintain a state of awareness enhancing intelligence and spirit next is the dragon tooth sword made from the teeth of a dragon increases critical damage by 50% deals additional damage to enemies with health below 20% when equipped with the dragon iring it grants immunity to all forms of mental control control such as Illusions and chaos and boosts resistance in abnormal States finally Yu looked at the most special item domain key of the red tailed Devil Dragon recommended level level 90 seeing the key yeu joyfully exclaimed this is it sa G after examining all the items shj scratched his head and said well how should I put it it seems like rare items in treasure chests or from the secret layer are even better better now the loot from this booss seems pretty normal all just immunity to mental control and not much money Zen Chen hearing this shot him a glance and replied don't measure by your own standards these things don't belong to you who knows they might be useful to Y Wu y wo held up the key and said to everyone these things are not important my main objective is this this is the domain key of the domain dungeon boss see him excited about the key Lan kin Yan asked are the items in there worth more than those in the secret lair Yi Wu explained of course according to the information I have the resources in this domain dungeon are worth at least 25 billion upon hearing the Colossal figure everyone was shocked what 25 billion Is that real or fake sa and haui started imagining mountains of gold unable to contain themselves shouting 25 billion oh my God God that amount of money could last a lifetime seeing the two of them so excited Zen Chang slap C show G hard causing him to cry out ah that hurts then Zing Chang scolded that's y woo stuff what are you two dreaming about y wo watched them argue only smiling calmly opened the inspection panel and said that's not wrong but before it becomes reality it's still just a useless string of numbers in his heart he thought to himself self moreover my level is not high enough to solo clear this level 90 dungeon although using the shadow King's account to fight a level 90 boss wouldn't be a problem he thought but in the dungeon domain there will definitely be a series of highlevel monsters and mini bosses if no one takes the lead it will be fundamentally impossible to get through thinking of this y Wu immediately send out a trade request Lan King yun's group suddenly received a trade request for the amount of 1 billion l King Yun was surprised and asked V woo this money is the others were also in an uproar 1 billion y wo what are you doing no matter how much money you have you can't just throw it around like that Yu just smiled and said didn't I say before that I would pay you all 1 billion this is the time to fulfill that promise Zen Chen awkwardly replied but we've already earned 70 million how can we accept more money from you he wo gently shook his head this matter is separate the secret lair and a secret lair were unexpected luck but this one billion is what I promised so you all can rest assured and accept it as he spoke he raised a finger to express his opinion sh G and how sh I hearing this were so happy they almost cried both rushed to hug him boss ye is truly Majestic and full of Charisma x g laughed loudly indeed it's boss ye and in order to earn equipment he even hired a mercenary group and as a result he spent money and effort while the one fighting The Mercenaries is bossi himself so they sat down on the ground tightly hugging Yu's legs and laughing joyfully from today onward I will hold on to this big thigh and not let go no one can compete with me the other thigh is mine Zen chain frowned and whipped each person once can you have a bit of ambition I see you two are really asking for a beating l king Yun seeing the two being hit was excited well done although ywu is a trustworthy person we can't always rely on him she turned to yiu and continued I won't be polite with you anymore ywo the money I received is already enough although we started with interests we definitely won't end just because of interests if you need help in the future just call on us the Horizon combat team will do our utmost to assist you yiu smiled in response then I won't be polite anymore actually there's something I'd like to ask you all for help with seeing you w had taken the initiative the group readily agreed go ahead let's hear it as the dusk began to fall the sun gradually dipped below the Horizon in the distant sky the shadows of monsters started to appear Yu looked into the distance and said I hope you can help me collect 11 pieces of intelligence from outside the safe Zone this is a vast land that I need to grasp whether it's about magical beasts human powers or domain dungeon materials any of it will do this is the weakness that I need to supplement so that I can be better prepared for future wild Expeditions y wo added moreover I feel that your team needs to be expanded even further ideally you could build your own scale of power upon hearing this the group seemed somewhat confused and asked him a scale of power can you elaborate on the reason y looked at L King Yun and then explained up until now you have been following the path of a small team there are two benefits to this first it is easy to act in Harmony and second personnel management is simple however even so during the last operation a Trader still appeared if the team were larger seeing that lamb King Yun appeared to be hesitant yiu continued with a strong point the amount of capital whether large or small will determine the differences in how to play before you didn't have much money so you choose a smaller more delicate path but now that you have money things are no longer the same as before you understand better than I do the importance of power in the wild the Teo Wang team is a typical example l king Yun slowly noded but still seemed to be pondering Zen Chang and Lan King Yun exchanged glances supplementing each other you really think far ahead on ordinary days we are already consumed with survival so we never thought about these things Zen Chang Chu chuckled lightly and spoke but I feel that Yi Wu makes a lot of sense for us this is also the best Turning Point the other two excitedly chimed in yeah that's true with our strength under equal conditions fighting four against six is already the limit if we continue like this it will be very difficult to take on teams of 10 although I also want to take this money to spend it for the sake of our future development we have to follow Yu's advice seeing that they had all grown up so much land King Yun could only scratch his head and say oh my gosh when did you all become so farsighted weren't you all the ones worrying about eating today and tomorrow l king Yun extended his hand regarding Yu's suggestion and said this is all thanks to yiu he has shown us a landscape a different level my vision was too narrow I couldn't lead you all to a higher level this team cannot lack you so this 1 billion can be considered as your investment it shares with us you are an important member and a shareholder of the Horizon combat team with priority rights to profit sharing and decision-making everyone agreed in unison seeing this Yu didn't wait any longer extended his hand for a handshake and said then I am honored to comply in his heart Yi Wu quietly praised himself thinking although I previously said my vision was limited now and has started to be called a battle team clearly deep down he still harbored great dreams like the white birds soaring freely he continued speaking then the matters in the wilderness will be entrusted to you after that he flew up and bid farewell to everyone saying let's say goodbye here if anything happens remember to contact me they also raised their hands to wave goodbye take care brother I will miss you very much safe travels after saying goodbye to everyone in the city the land King Yun team immediately called their families yanf where are you guys the person on the other end replied finally we have a signal you turned off your phone before and we couldn't contact you for anything another person also spoke to him we are still in area 8 and Mimi has found a temporary place to stay the location has been sent to you y Wu immediately responded I will go there right away after confirming that they were still safe in area 8 Yi Wu quickly flew over feeling thrilled the royal angel cloak fused from the Royal cloak and the fallen angel wings cloak true tattered but also magnificent although there are still limitations on altitude for flying yiu has also shortened the travel time and emphasized safety along with practicality in the hanm group's luxurious housing area everyone gathered on the sofa in the living room behind M Moi n were two close subordinates and she held a teacup while sitting in a chair talking to him earlier due to the ongoing state of War we can only temporarily stay in this house I apologize for the inconvenience to you all please stay here for a while yigu shyy replied haha it's okay in his mind he thought is this what you call inconvenience she must have some misunderstanding about the word inconvenience inside the fully furnished and luxurious Family Residence he was also seated beside her he continued to admire the opulence of the house in my life up to now I have never seen such a grand and spacious home yanf seeing her brother return safely eagerly asked with a hint of concern did you see the battle of the boss thankfully you returned safely earlier there was a horrific scream from the boss that came from area 9 I was scared to death when Neu heard his younger sister wanted to watch that battle he took out the peculiar key he had obtained after the fight and proudly said is it just watching the battle what do you think this is as he said this he held up the strange key yanf looked at the key Yi Wu was holding seeming unsure of what it was and could hesitantly asked is it a key made of gold what is it for M unexpectedly spoke up with a look of confusion isn't this the key I mentioned before the dungeon domain key that drops from the boss how did it end up in your hands did you Yuni grabbed his hand and excitedly asked you must have killed the boss right yiu smiled indulgently at his sister and replied you're very smart Yun seeing him confirmed that that he killed the boss continued to ask are you joking this time leading the team to fight the boss is like Yin Guan her strategy in the team and her contributions are top five how is it possible that you weren't robbed of the boss seeing her a bit skeptical he laughed hardly haha I'm just lucky I found an opportunity before his answer m n seemed not very satisfied so she continued to ask is the opportunity to defeat a level 90 boss merely a fleeting moment just how much strength have you been hiding this is your private matter I won't ask too much but in the end what happened with the opportunity seeing her inquire like this Yu did not disclose all that had happened but only said this will be reported in detail later by the team I won't say more there's just one thing you must know he seriously reminded her the hanmo group seems to be the target of the public now and even the tan chuong group has begun to betray although the hanmo is very powerful ful he has made enemies everywhere I fear that one day not letting him finish she couldn't believe it expressing her feelings and asking in a rather loud voice the tyan chuong group is betraying although she was already so upset that her face flushed moai still maintained the calm attitude to deduce the situation I can roughly guess the situation you don't need to worry about the handm mo group we will remain steadfast and develop according to ourselves no matter how the external circumstances change only having strength within ourselves is fundamental however deep down keenai couldn't just say Let It Be and actually let it be it's just that the board of directors has set external relations and development strategies too aggressively and arrogantly continuing like this will become a very unstable factor I have suggested many times but they never took my words to Heart hearing her say that y Wu understood perfectly and he smiled in response it's not my place to worry about this be being a newcomer compared to this I want to know more about the distribution of the spoils this time although it was previously stated that the spoils of the battle group must be submitted half to the corporation how should my situation be handled mmai replied upon hearing this your situation is indeed special especially since you have not yet officially joined HMO group so your information and the group you want to establish have not been entered theoretically the spoils this time do not need to be submitted to the upper man agement at all they are entirely yours upon hearing her say this yanf couldn't contain herself her eyes wide with excitement immediately switching to a money hungry State shouting 2.5 billion is ours oh my God Am I Dreaming her clear statement made MC mokai think to herself whichever guy you take he truly is one of us y Wu had his own thoughts he took the initiative to say understood then I will proactively submit half of the money to the higher-ups M's words startled her and upon hearing this she asked back taking advantage of the lofo in the rules you don't need to submit it a person who loves money like you why would you actively give up the benefits at hand YW calmly explained giving two reasons he stood up under the admiring gaze of his younger sibling and said first a person should not be too greedy although I am someone who loves money very much since I joined the hanmo group I must act according to the rules no matter what this time I have taken the boss of the Mong team if I were to be malicious and seize it it would be no different from making the entire team my enemy more importantly if we the king team want to become your Force we cannot harm your position and reputation in the group for immediate benefits he emphasized therefore I choose to do it this way you could say it is also for you when Moi heard him mention it was for her she stammer and asked back for for me the two subordinates behind her were in awe giving a thumbs up to him praising Yu's way of winning her favor meanwhile Mo young lady felt shy her cheeks flushed turning her face away bashfully saying well if you have decided this way I won't stop you unexpectedly he passed by her and sat down right next to her asking how should I submit it now MMI nag replied without haste in the future there will be a special event evaluation Department to assess the benefits but you will have two options she continued to explain specifically in front of everyone firstly you can directly submit all the profits including the key to the domain dungeon the corporation based on the agreement will return 50% to you the advantage of this method is that you won't need to manage anything just wait to receive the money this method is the most straightforward you can self assess the value of the 50% profit submit it and then continue to hold the key to enter the domain dungeon to check resources after that according to the old rules submit about 50% like before secondly this method carries more variables and risks as soon as she finished speaking he immediately said then I won't hesitate anymore I choose the second method although this was a somewhat risky choice in Yu's heart he softly thought with my Royal physique the higher the risk the greater the profits moai smiled and said I understand this Choice also aligns with your personality then she stood up and said all right I will handle the submission I'm leaving now he just replied hm as she was leaving she seemed to remember something and turned back to say by the way according to the corporation's benefits everyone can go to zones four five or six and stay there it's much safer than here do you want to go when the situation is on high alert I will send someone to pick you up Yi Wu skillfully declined not for now after just going through a major battle with the beasts there surely won't be any significant movements moreover I have friends in zone 9 I don't want to go too far Zone 8 is quite good as well let's talk about it later after sometime what he said was just an excuse Yu thought to himself the most crucial point was that he shouldn't move too close to the corporation Center where he would be monitored and controlled limiting Freedom wouldn't be good two subordinates went ahead to escort him MCM n opened the door for her to step out as she was walking she said all right then when you want to move just let me know by the way there's one more thing at this point she paused turned around and tossed him a card then she continued I have issued you a card this card grants you access in the area from 1 to n allowing free movement convenient for your daily activities he gently caught it his posture very sve and thank her thank you young lady you are very considerate receiving the card Yu happily thought this is definitely a good thing extremely useful seeing her walk a short distance and then look back repeatedly Yun feay jokingly covered his mouth and said Miss Mo are you reluctant to part with my brother you could stay for several times spending a few nights is fine too he Moy knee appeared to be hit by the truth she clenched her fists and immediately denied no need after moai left Yu's parents also approached him yiu said Mom and Dad I'm truly sorry do to some personal reasons I chose to stay temporarily in area 8 there's no way to bring everyone to a safer place to live they didn't blame him but gently said little how no matter what decision you make we will unconditionally support you his mother completely agreed with her husband and said that's right after that she turned to Nana and said moreover the facilities here are fully equipped it's very good my husband and I never imagined we would live in such an expensive room the only drawback is that the room is too big cleaning it to tiring seeing her say that Nana cheerfully replied it's nothing I'll take care of it then everyone happily stood close to each other Yun Fe gave a thumbs up and said brother no matter where we are as long as the whole family is together that is the best place Nana smiled with her eyes squinted and sweetly said sister is absolutely right but deep down she secretly thought with disdain how nauseating can this scene end quickly ywu saw that everyone was in agreement like this and he said yeah while secretly thinking this is the motivation for me to strive tonight the sky is full of stars and the moon shines brightly he thinks in the end times most people believe that family is a burden so they often choose to live alone but I am truly lucky to have been born into a happy family and I must strive to protect this happiness well until now although temporarily stationed at hanmo group that is not the ultimate goal only when I have built that solid defensive stronghold will it truly be a home belonging to a happy family in our future yinu ordered ADV Vis to bring out the blueprints of the stronghold to begin analyzing what price must be paid to reach the ideal in the future ivz listened to the command and replied at your command the robot Vis hesitated Master the analysis results are in but the situation is not very optimistic Yu asked what is it speak I VI Vis replied first the construction point of this map requires at least a level 40 Dungeon to proceed with the construction Yu responded that's not too difficult previously I obtained a level 40 Dungeon key from the black tiger mercenaries I was just thinking about when to use it and now it's just the right time when here I Vis say that the cost is 5 billion ye wo fetal as if struck by lightning what why is it so expensive is this the legendary scam Yi Wu exclaims IIs replies this is just the initial cost additionally there are many rare props and materials that you need to maintain your enthusiasm ywai my Zeal has been dampened by more than half I Vis tries to encourage him don't be disheartened Master you are are powerful enough spending that amount of money is only a matter of time yiu gives a bitter laugh I understand this principle but the emptiness in my heart is overwhelming like the difference between the River water level and the sea I Vis continues to explain after accumulating more money and props we will enter the construction phase specifically you only need to use the master construction skill to create a large number of robots to serve the construction project this step for you is like having breakfast the only hassle is that you must be present for the entire process because without you the construction robots will not be able to operate y Wu complained it's really Troublesome but can I delegate control of the robot to Nana so she can oversee the construction instead of me ad robot viz replied that's a good idea she was also created by the owner equivalent to your avatar so managing these construction robots shouldn't be a problem y Wu said let's decide on that the remaining issue is how to quickly increase the funds creating a legendary level AI is definitely not easy for now I'm thinking about pushing the fusion rate of the Shadow cane a little further it seems we can only proceed gradually currently we shouldn't encounter any strong enemies for a while so we need to prioritize leveling up first ultimately it still comes down to money while they were talking yiu was unexpectedly splashed with water Yi yanf shouted come play over here this pool is so much fun nearby was Nana who took advantage of Y Yan F's moment of inattention to splash water at her teasing chance drink this water y Yan Fe was caught off guard by the splash exclaiming OMG Nana is so cunning seeing them having fun Yu thought to himself it's been a long time since I've seen F face so relaxed all my efforts so far have not been in vain he said to the two of them you guys keep playing I won't you y wo had not finished his sentence when a jet of water shot out water Suffocation damn haha the master also needs to learn to relax being too serious can make it hard to have fun in yiwu's mind a thought flickered come on I have to seize this opportunity to drown you Yu's fighting Spirit ignited as he looked at Nana and said right haha Nana's skills are really impressive it reminds me of those years when I was the king of the pool he jumped up and said said loudly today let me show you all what it means to be the king of water fights y Yun Fe laughed out loud here it comes your familiar skills haha laughter resonated throughout the pool area a friend exclaimed Master we won't dare anymore spare us yiu retorted just wait take this skill of mine laughter echoed all around creating a joyful and relaxed atmosphere meanwhile in the vice president's office of the handm group headquarters Yin Hulan was kneeling in the middle of the room bowing his head and saying y master I sincerely apologize I did not expect the taian chuang group to betray us nor was I prepared for the Huang Jin group to send assassins this has put the boss in a disadvantaged position he continued as the team leader I will take full responsibility I hope the young Master punishes me the young Master stood up walked over and said consider it that you stand by yourself but do you think this excuse can justify your failure Yin muan replied young master I mokai didn't let her continue and immediately delivered a straight kick to her making her scream in pain Moi said ultimately it's because you are too weak you still have the nerve to kneel before me the top fighting Power of mokong yet your team couldn't even defeat a level 90 boss you have completely lost the face of hanmo group you one hubbed her hurt spot trembling as she said I truly apologize Mo key continued to slap her his voice cold I don't have time to listen to your meaningless words the slap was so forceful that it made her scream out in pain Moi approached grabbed her by the neck and growled i' brought you from the poor Village spent so much money to nurture you not for you to come back with this useless appearance and hinder my path suddenly the voice of GI vong rank H out from somewhere that's enough mokai Moi angrily retorted what you can't handle this much are you lamenting over this adorable team member G Wang Chun replied I just don't want you to waste your time on boring things and forget about what you should be doing Moy hearing this waved his hand and said ah of course not where's the information on the boss dealer show it to me GW Chun opened the information panel and said of course here it is this person was invited into the company by the young lady just before the boss battle took place and hasn't officially registered yet Mo's face darkened the person that Kai brought in stealing the boss if she try and go against me seeing yiwu's information pop up M Kei exploded in Anger cursing y woo where the hell did this guy come from is ke that crazy relying on a weak level six to go against me gwang Chu and responded you can't be fooled by the external level if he could steal the boss right in front of Yin guan's group his strength is definitely not to be underestimated Mo key scoffed deliberately hiding his level just a small trick what exactly is this guy Yu's strength is there no ad that has information about him Yin huan you have the most authority to speak here Yin huan replied deep and unmeasurable even though the boss is only at 3% Health it's still in a frenzied state yet he was able to conclude the battle with overwhelming momentum defeating the boss in an instant Moi was very surprised after hearing this and said mockingly if he is really such a strong Talent why didn't you recruit him and instead let him join Kai Yin Juan replied I tried to lure him but it didn't work Moi upon hearing this became angry and grabbed her by the throat didn't work is there still someone who dares to refuse you this is not like you Yin Ruan with your usual way of doing things a person who is so ungrateful like him shouldn't have been able to survive under your hands or do you like that kiddo so you let him go Yin Juan being choked troubled uh young Master M Kei violently threw her to the ground and said coldly trash you make me very curious about that kid I will give you one last chance I don't care how you do it whether by threats or seduction you must make y Wu join me if that kid still refuses kill him to avoid future troubles yinan coughed and accepted the order cough cough yes young Master cough cough G Wang Chun step forward and said this time don't blame me for not stepping in to help you plead for Mercy after all this is something you cause is that y wo really is formidable as you say gin huan replied her voice calm but her meaning profound I never expected my words to be so powerful that I couldn't even distinguish who was Stronger between you and the captain seeing this G wangchu and also spoke up is that so but until now I haven't heard you highly praise anyone like that this kiddo has indeed sparked my interest a feeling I haven't had in many years Wang Chuan said to Yin Juan during this time you should temporarily leave the unit and think of a way to deal with ywo remember it's best to recruit him if you can't hand him over to me I will handle him personally Yin huan nodded and replied yes saying that he turned and walked away in her heart Yin thought to herself Yi Wu your recent boss seizing action has stirred up a great storm not only has it affected our Mong team but perhaps even the tyen chuong and Wang Jen groups have also added you to their list of targets what surprised Yin hon the most was the captain who had always been arrogant seemed to have taken an interest in y Wu this time she looked up at the night sky wondering to herself could my assessment inadvertently harm him this is not my intention and I don't wish to be his adversary no matter what I still hope that he can join and fight alongside me the next day at zone 9 at the Academy loud noises echoed throughout the campus finally I can see the sun again I would have turned moldy if I had to stay down there any longer a complaining voice rang out this is all because the boss took over zone 9 I heard that yesterday the Mong team was wiped out truly they are the strongest team in the hando group another person chimed in someone countered no way I heard the research team discussing that the final boss was taken down by a single person is that true or false taking down a level 90 Boss by oneself is just too incredible everyone was Lively discussing the one who had defeated the final boss Ru and Ty and tan excitedly said a single person took down the boss could it be y woo Lu Fang smiled beside her it must be him the only person who could accomplish such an extraordinary feat besides the boss himself is no one else however Ru un Ty and Tan's excitement did not last long she began to worry but that was a level 90 boss even if y wo could win he must have paid a heavy price like being seriously injured I'm so worried about him luang agreed that is very possible I need to contact him right away to see if he's okay while they were talking a student suddenly pointed to the sky looking panicked look what is that a streak of light was flying straight towards them from above leaving everyone stunned within it a high energy reaction was occurring then yiu appeared from the light making everyone gas wow it's ye woo the effect from that cloak is really cool Lu Fang was overjoyed to see him and rushed over boss I'm so glad you're all right Ruan tianan felt flustered as she watched y wo appear with such an imposing presence what is going on it hasn't been long since we last met yet ywo seems even more dazzling than before my heart is racing Lu Fang ran to hug his leg bursting into tears boss you're unharmed you really are incredible I can't believe I dare to doubt your strength I'm true TR sorry I'm not worthy to be your Junior the principal and Miss lie came to greet him y Woo you're back the academy here is safe now so there's no need to worry YW asked the principal what does the academy plan to do next he replied I have contacted hanmo group they have agreed to quickly send people to rebuild the academy and area 9 in the meantime everyone will take a break from school to stay with their families and work together to get through this difficult time the principal patted gu woo on the shoulder and said it's just you once again saving the academy but the academy cannot offer you a reward worthy of your efforts yiu politely replied hearing the principal's words is already good enough as a member of the academy this is what I should do I absolutely do not see rewards as my goal Lu Fang exclaimed no wonder he's the boss his words are so skillful both showcasing generosity and not completely rejecting the reward the system notification reminded the passive skill hormone stimulation has been activated the affection of the teachers and students across the school has increased by 200% please pay attention to your personal safety the owner around them everyone was paying attention to ywo a female student exclaimed oh my God y wo is both strong and handsome y woo I want to have your children another male student chimed in V woo we also want to have your children the two sides argued loudly the girls shouted yeah have what you guys are boys can you even give birth go compete for a guy with the girls how Shameless the boys were unwilling to back down and responded fiercely although we don't know why we are willing can you control that y Wu did not expect this situation he gasped and thought OMG what is happening this unethical skill has been activated in such a crowded place if this continues something bad will happen sooner or later he ran for his life yelling Ruan tanan Lu Fang follow me closely we need to get out of here quickly the two of them ran after him Lu Fang said understood boss Ru and tan asked vwoo where are we going now y Wu responded did the situation at home get sorted out luang replied it's all set I contacted my family earlier we had had a bit of money so when the incident first occurred I took them to Zone 8 they are safe there ruin tan tan added I'm fine my family doesn't live in this city I'm all alone so I have nothing to worry about hearing that Yu smiled and said then let's leave the safe Zone together and head to the special Wilderness Area I just got a level 40 Dungeon from those black tiger mercenaries everyone get ready at that moment y wo and his teammates had reached The City Gate this was the entrance to zone 9 and it was currently under repair seeing yiwu's group a soldier shouted loudly stop you over there then he raised his gun and asked loudly what are you doing this is not a place for a stroll or chatting in the face of the soldiers aggression y Wu calmly replied officer we are all students and just want to go outside the city to do a few things please allow us to pass this Soldier was a level 10 guard but he was very stubborn and continued to shout students going outside the city at this time the emergency order has not yet been lifted no one is allowed to go out get back to school now or you'll be shot seeing that the soldier was unreasonable and arrogant like this Lu Fang angrily spoke up you a level 10 Soldier dare to cause trouble here do you know who our boss is y Wu quickly sto L Fang and calmly said don't provoke him we are all good students and do not want to cause trouble then Yu took out his pass and showed it to the soldier saying officer here is my pass please take a look y wo held the pass in his hand and handed it to the Guard the guard glanced at the document and said where did this pass come from I've never seen it before how can I tell if it's real or fake is it your first day on the job hearing this ye W immediately thought that this must be a newcomer which is why he didn't recognize the pass just then the team leader of the new Soldier arrived he asked irritably what are you all doing standing here wasting time why haven't you kicked them out yet the guard then handed Yu's pass to the teen leader for inspection upon seeing the document the teen Leader's expression changed drastically he scolded and struck the soldier saying this is the highest level pass from hanm group don't you recognize this signature quickly review your training and educate yourself after that the team leader turned to ywo clasped his hands and apologized saying a distinguished guest comes and our small station fails to recognize it this is a serious oversight I'm not sure where you want to go but I can dispatch a team of vehicles to take you it's not very safe outside hearing the offer y Wu quickly declined I already have Arrangements I just need you to open The City Gate as The City Gate began to open Ruan tanan expressed her excitement saying what should we do I'm so nervous this is my first time leaving the city Lu Fang said Ty and tan calm down a bit this time going out to the Wilderness is also an opportunity for training remember to cherish this opportunity looking at the group of them slowly walking out of the city the captain thought to himself why wuha he is the one that the higher-ups have designated for special attention but I haven't seen anything special about him yet thinking this he reported via the intercom to someone boss the kid named y Wu just left the city what should we do next hearing this news the person on the other end felt that this was a good thing the person on the other end was me too level 85 an elite mercenary of the Hong Jen group she instructed the captain just quietly follow Yu's group and Report every action of the target be careful not to be discovered when she heard the name y woo Mau felt a bit intrigued just yesterday a bounty had been placed on him and now she encountered him again she was sure that this time she would take down Yu in the wilderness outside zone 9 Yu was talking to the two people beside him is this really the world outside the safe Zone Lu Fang replied this is All That Remains of the old world a desolate and decayed image Ruan Tian Tian said I have only seen images of the Wilderness online or in books today witnessing it with my own eyes I can feel the oppressive atmosphere of this last place even more contrary to tian's worried demeanor Lu Fang appeared excited and replied why overthink it I think we should take advantage of breathing in this fresh air luang curiously asked Yu how do we get to the dungeon if the boss can just fly straight there alone that would be easy but bringing us along must be a hassle right Yu cheerfully said it won't be a hindrance at all I've arranged everything theoretically the area closest to the Wilderness will be the safest after all encounter monsters is just bad luck if we do encounter any along the way we can take the opportunity to gain some experience that wouldn't be bad everyone here is an important member of my king team and no one can be left behind in terms of level Ty Tian and L Fang listened to Yu's words not understanding only looking on with curiosity what is this King team TNT and asked yiu replied we'll discuss the details as we go along luu Fang understood that the king team was established by his boss and was also a part of the handm mo group thinking about joining such a wealthy company made both Lou Fang and Tian Tian feel delighted they never expected they could be part of it Tian Tian quite curious asked but can you really join the combat team of Mo's company directly and reach the peak of your life like that why start from scratch like this couldn't be too disadvantageous Lu Fang agreed saying that's right boss you can solo a level 91 boss boss of god tier existence meanwhile we are just small ants so we might hinder your progress yiu smiled and explained that's why I brought you two to farm levels from the 40 Dungeon today you need to strive to catch up so don't get discouraged hearing this Lu Fang and Tian tyan were filled with determination promising we will definitely do our best not to let Yu down just then an off-road vehicle drove up and stopped right in front of them the person inside quickly stepped out introducing himself of course I am your talented anduve man brother I've arrived I didn't expect we would meet so soon at this moment SE G noticed Ty Tien looking quite excited to see her he even scolded Yoo why didn't you give a heads up that there would be a beauty accompanying us today if I had known earlier I would have dressed up nicely after returning C sh G immediately greeted tyan Tian and introduced himself I am C G A Relic Hunter this wild Place feels just like my backyard I will take good care of you faced with C sh G's enthusiasm tan tyan could only force a smile greet him back and say thank you I am Ruan tyen Tian I hope you could take good care of me observing c g she thought this person has a very high level and is a friend of ywu however he is too enthusiastic and generous at this moment Lu Fang was very excited about seeing sh G Shield continually praising you can tell this person is an expert just looking at this Shield shows decisiveness receiving such compliments SEO G happily replied no wonder you are the junior of brother y Lu Fang feel free to ask me anything you don't know y woo urged everyone anxiously hurry up and get on the road I have important things to do the vehicle had already started rolling as mentioned over the phone Yi Wu instructed C sh G to leave everyone to area c87 there C sh G recalled they had passed through before but found no entrance to the dungeon hearing this yiu took out a key and explained that place requires this dungeon key enter the durability of the key is currently at only 10% it has decreased significantly Yu felt lucky that he could finally use the map before it deteriorated seeing y Wu holding the map CG curiously asked brother this map looks Exquisite at first first glance but is it genuine it even contains coordinate information for us The Relic Hunters it is truly invaluable Yu replied of course it's real this map was personally drawn by mu way upon hearing the name mu way SEO G was taken back he abruptly slammed on the brakes and anxiously asked again is the muo why you just mentioned the legendary Relic Hunter Yu nodded in confirmation that's right it's mu way it's is there something wrong s G's intense reaction further Peak Yu's curiosity he guessed that c g must know something about mu Sao G sighed and said the story of mu way is quite lengthy as we go along I'll tell you in the eyes of most people treasure Hunters like us are those who value money more than life we don't plunder from people but from ruins but that's just the surface in reality what we are searching for is the truth of this world and because of that we must gradually explore all the ruins upon hearing about the truth of the world yiu was very curious and asked back the truth of the world really C Ren G replied has anyone ever questioned how and why the Earth came to be like this Ruan tantan also recalled and said it seems that there were some conspiracy theories circulating in the past some people believe that this world is Just a Dream While others thought that it is merely a pro jection of high-dimensional information some even went so far as to say that we are actually just data in a database merely part of a grand game of artificial intelligence a controls Our Fate and thoughts and everything has already been programmed hearing this Lu Fang said these are just theories from a long time ago nowadays few people mention them and no one discusses them anymore y w responded after so many generations perhaps people have become accustomed to this era or simply wished to live this brief life sa G contended habits do not equate to the truth we have always believed that every phenomenon has a cause if we continue to excavate ancient relics there will come a day when we uncover the Buri truth hearing C sh G speak like that Yu I can't believe this guy he seems frivolous on the outside yet has a hard inclin towards philosophy yiwu's words made C sh G feel a bit embarrassed and he smiled replying too flattering in fact those words were said to me by the captain I'm just a rough person like that how could I possibly have such thoughts Sao G continued I and the other members of The Horizon combat team are all attracted by a captain's ideals which is why we came together without SEO G saying anything Yu had already guessed that this philosophy belonged to Captain Lan King yiu thought to himself previously when I heard him say he was still young I thought it was just a joke but clearly this vision and these ideals are not something that Ordinary People possess after discussing philosophy C sh G brought up a rumor the legendary Relic Hunter moay who is said to have grasped 10 parts of the truth of the world however he has been missing for a long time and no one knows his whereabouts if the map that yiu possesses is indeed a drawing of his then it surely contains a secret perhaps Clues to uncovering the truth of the world ye Wu unfolded the map to take a look but no matter how he examined it he couldn't see anything special after that he said even if we uncover the truth what can it change time will still keep flowing won't it seeing that y Wu still didn't understand C Ren G began to share a legend that circulated among the treasure Hunters if someone can uncover the truth of this world that person can restart the world according to their own will and become the king of the world after hearing this Legend both Lu Fang and Ruan and tan found it very intriguing the two of them began to paint a picture of what it would be like when they became the rulers of the world Ru and Tian Tian said if I could restart the world I would definitely turn it into a magical world filled with love and peace luang replied what would that even mean if it were me I would become the ruler of the world the Supreme Monarch uniting the globe Yu looked at Lu Fang and Tian Tian then concluded with the remark you two are about to achieve that right now you just need to dream a dream to make it happen Lu Fang and Tian tyan could only awkwardly smile youu believed that this Legend was too Fantastical and that it was better to focus on the reality at hand hearing that c g agreed and added humans should have dreams otherwise they are no different from fish when it came to dreams Yi Wu felt that it was a luxury he thought that everything he was doing at present was simply to achieve a practical goal not for the sake of a dream he didn't even know what his dream was nevertheless c g encouraged him if we can find mu way we will have more clues this is not wishful thinking as for Mu way ye W believe that the principal must know a lot he told himself that after finishing this dungeon run he must go to the principal to ask for more information after a while the group arrived at a place it was a cliff tan Tian didn't believe this was the entrance to the dungeon because there was no door in sight Lu Fang thought the entrance must be cloaked they just needed to activate it with Yu's key otherwise it would have been discovered by someone else long ago at this point yiu smiled mysteriously but first we have to deal with the followers Sao G next Dam also quickly realized that someone was tailing them he replied following one road and inhaling all this dust it really makes it tough for them both tyen Tien and LU Fang upon hearing their conversation suddenly realized the situation at that moment c g spoke while throwing out a weapon as for anti- reccon expertise I am indeed a specialist you two still have a lot to learn as soon as he finished speaking the weapon immediately lit up and exploded creating a thick cloud of dust the tailing Guys nearby had to cough violently in this situation the group following them realized they had been detected Lu Fang was still bewildered damn it there really are people following me he blamed himself for not noticing this feeling like he had made a foolish mistake luang realized that these tailor were precisely The Gatekeepers from before the teen leader got out of the vehicle and cautiously explained I truly had concerns about your safety but you all didn't allow us to follow so we had to hide and protect you to get here y woop immediately drew his sword pointed it at him and said then it truly must have been difficult for you I hope that with this expression the paragraph has become clearer and easier to understand the captain maintained his smile and replied it's not hard at all everything is for serving everyone however it seems that the way you're pointing your sword right now is not very appropriate y woo upon hearing this only gave a faint smile the reason you gave is really laughable can't you come up with a more reasonable excuse a cranky ugly old man like you should just end this awkward conversation being called a cranky ugly old man the captain of the guards explained you misunderstand I might look scruffy with my unkempt beard but I'm only 28 years old not the cranky old man you described though he spoke cheerfully in his heart he cursed y woo damn it daring to point a sworded me if it weren't for the fact that you have a level 55 person by your side I would have acted already as he thought this he signal to his subordinates behind him the guards quickly understood the cue this was a body language Tac IC designed for the mute and deaf indicating that they should immediately form a triangle formation ready to attack his intention was that if Yu made the first move they would instantly retaliate in defense they believed that on Yu's side there was only one level 55 person and the others were insignificant thinking that if a real fight broke out it wouldn't be enough to cope Yu happily said well then I will accept everyone's good intentions we all managed to find a way to survive in the face of death when the monsters attacked the city therefore we should trust and support each other more and reduce our suspicions right seeing the other party appeared excited Yi Wu changed his mind thinking instead of killing them without any value it is better to use them to catch the big fish behind the scenes seeing this the teen leader expressed agreement nodding and saying that's right that's right surviving such a disaster is indeed a stroke of luck it wasn't easy at all after that he continued to signal to his subordinates and thought it can't be that easy to trick can it with an IQ like this how could he win the company's prize this kid must be the son of some associate in the hando group so he only has level six but manages to have the highest level pass thinking this he pretended to be oblivious scratched his head and asked may I ask ye W young Master what the purpose is for everyone to gather and form a team to venture into the wild mountains ignoring such dangers when the young Master asked yiu replied bluntly what Young Master moreover running this far has only one purpose to explore the new dungeon so are you interested in joining upon hearing this Lu Fang and tanan secretly rejoiced they knew that their boss was best at luring others into a trap those guys thought they were clever but in reality they were just being deceived when the captain heard this he panicked and said you you can't be joking right looking at this dungeon key it must be at least level 40 even if there is one person at level 55 if the average level of the group is still not enough then going in to explore without strategic information is no different from going to die at this point luang continued that's why we called you all to join us so are you scared didn't you all say you would protect us when you came here tyen tingin also chimed in to tease him a bit is this the security team of zone 9 no wonder we are being invaded by beasts hearing this the captain was so Furious he almost spat blood he found tyen tyan beautiful but he couldn't understand why she spoke so provocatively just got humiliated by Yu's group I turned back to meet my team these guys were brainless all full of enthusiasm they said Captain we can't let those greenh horns look down on us you have to show them how good we are hearing those words I internally screamed and cursed those idiots I basically have no experience in exploring the dungeon one wrong move and I could lose my life just like that but for the sake of face I could only remain calm and say this dungeon can surely be entered by five people although I really want to join I can't bear to leave my dear teammates behind it's truly a Pity quickly ye wo ease my worries when he said this dungeon can accommodate anywhere from 5 to 10 people everyone can go in together having said that I had no more excuses to make and could only swallow my anger while participating contrary to my anxious demeanor the team members were very excited about this dungeon they were all full of energy and proudly declared then let those students see what professionalism really looks like let's go Brothers Let's explore Captain show your might the captain of the team reluctantly followed along and silently calculated if danger arose he would use those students as a buffer the key was to wait until the boss ran past here at this moment the door to the dungeon had opened Yu said to the guards sorry to trouble you to escort us the captain replied just form a protective circle around us Yu continued this matter cannot be delayed we must proceed immediately the group entered the cave to ensure safety the captain emitted a signal to let the young lady know their coordinates this was a signal tracking device for artificial intelligence standard for guard teams with a wide transmission range in Front was the dungeon life jungle level 40 everyone assessed that the scenery of this dungeon was both beautiful and primitive with an unusually vast area it truly didn't resemble a level 40 Dungeon hearing this tienan praised the chubby guy really is knowledgeable I wonder what kinds of magical beasts there will be it is both exciting and terrifying the giant tree that Shades the sky is so unusually large that it is truly commendable SE Ren G based on my rich experience guessed that this big tree could be the dwelling of the boss hearing cow Ren G's extensive knowledge Lu Fang couldn't help but admire him saying boss in the upcoming battle I hope you will guide the junior further C Reni laughed hardly haha easy to say easy to say but the top priority is still to follow me closely don't run around and then lose your life for nothing from above Yu told AZ carefully analyze whether this dungeon can be used to build a base I've this quickly completed the analysis and reported this dungeon can be used as a base but the compatibility only reaches three stars yiu pondered only three stars that doesn't meet my five-star standard it seems this time we can only grind for experience just then T tan discovered something and shouted everyone quickly look up at the sky something is flying towards us very quickly someone recognized it and shouted a small bird that's a level 25 batwing wyvern holy [ __ ] is this what you call a small bird the Roar of the Batwing wyvern echoed across the sky it charged straight at the captain fortunately he managed to raise his shield in defense the captain's demeanor inspired the other guards to fight with even greater fervor they frantically attacked the creature you woo watched and remarked oh the team isn't bad they coordinate very well they must have undergone quite a bit of training after an intense battle the guards finally brought down the Batwing wyvern the captain feeling proud said it's just a level 20 batwing wyvern and it dared to fly over my head don't it know that my area is in no-fly zone haha the guards praised him Captain you're so handsome and so impressive with Feer we feel secure just as they were chatting another Roar suddenly emerged causing everyone to turn pale it was the sound of a level 40 prickly snake Dragon before the group could gather their wits it swooped down and snatched one of the team members the teammate could only panic and cry for help as he was engulfed in the jaws of the Ferocious Beast the beast in the salon soared into the air and directly threw him down as a result he lost his life in such a situation the captain had no choice but to charge forward he shouted loudly fat guy level 55 over there hurry up and support me what are you doing standing there like an idiot just because you're higher level than me do you want me to come help you damn it hearing this cow Ren G hesitated and turned to ask Yu what should we do now do we want to take action Yu replied we still have to say face the final checkpoint in the dungeon is still far away we will need our strength for future challenges hearing this C renji agreed and surged forward with Vigor he shouted everyone get out of my way don't obstruct me it's just a level 40 Beast I can handle it without breaking a sweat at that moment Yu received a prompt from the system the mysterious egg suddenly reacted violently mentioning the egg yiu remembered and asked egg what's wrong with you are you hungry or is something hurting Yu guessed that the egg had sensed the presence of its kind and wanted to hatch the mysterious egg continuously stirred with unusual activity yuu stood with his hand in his pocket eyes fixed on the egg that was bouncing non-stop in front of him he wondered it's been silent for so long why is it suddenly making a fuss could it really be wanting to break out of its shell y Wu quickly opened the system continuing like this won't do let's first use what we just received to see if it helps on the system screen two items appeared with the description monsters Tom and Treacher chess Beast for the Mystic certificate at that moment the egg no longer bounced around but stopped in front of him trembling and exuding an air of discomfort Yu saw it like this and felt it was strange well at least it is calmed down but why does it look like it's constipated suddenly the a robot viz appeared and spoke could it be that it wants to break out but doesn't have enough power to break the shell ye who thought of this and suddenly beads of sweat began to pour down his face um that is indeed a possibility he abruptly took out a heart of the devil dragon with a Sinister look at the egg if you really want to come out like this then I'll help you a bit swallow this and you will gain the power to break the shell and come out the egg looked at him frightened sweat began to appear on its shell and it quickly backed away trembling all over yo seeing its frightened attitude asked what's wrong are you scared because you can sense the breath of your kin he smiled coldly and said it's just a piece of meat what is there to be afraid of if you don't even have a little bit of determination you might as well honestly stay inside your shell for your whole life being a useless egg the egg heard this its face scrunched up and it jumped up and down expressing its anger wahwah boooo y woo see its attitude for the first time laugh loudly truly simple-minded and you've already been provoked he quickly threw the heart into its mouth now let me see what you can evolve into the egg seeing the heart rushed towards it panicked and screamed a but before it could react the heart had already slipped right into its mouth swallowing the heart it shook continuously emitting small Sparks its mouth tightened as if it was trying to endure the AI robot I Vish shouted at this moment it's here the shell is about to break a powerful light shot straight up into the sky and the ey Vis robot exclaimed in astonishment oh my that's a strong AA Yu covered his eyes from the glaring Light In Praise not bad not bad it should have such a formidable Aura suddenly the system displayed a notification congratulations Master you have obtained a battle pet please name your pet ye wo watched as the creature resembling a dragon slowly emerged he thought if I've chosen it as my battle Beast then the name must be imposing and have a bit of flare after that he decided to call it Crimson Comet the complete red dragon appeared and the system recorded its information Crimson Comet level six belonging to the demon dragon race status ownerless current owner y woo in another place the captain of the Guard team had just defeated the prickly snake Dragon he swung a metal ball at it while commenting although it was a bit difficult I finally completed it without any danger suddenly he felt that something was off and wondered huh what's going on behind me yuu stood next to the small Beast Crimson Comet smiling as he watched it stretch and unleash small bolts of lightning the captain of the Guard seeing this scene couldn't help but exclaim what is that why is there a monster like it behind a team member noticing Crimson Comet remarked it's only level six we just need to find someone to deal with it this person quickly raised his gun m ing a low-level Beast like this falling into a crowd like this is definitely doomed but killing you won't give much experience just as he was about to pull the trigger Crimson Comet charged towards him letting out a fierce Roar it opened its mouth wide and crushed the gun in his hand the man stared wide-eyed at the creature fearfully shouting ah I only have this one gun the monster continued to attack charging towards Sak sh G however he quickly used a large Shield to block its mouth watching the monster gnawing at the shield with all its might he disdainfully said hey I haven't done anything to you so why are you biting my shield the captain of the Guard twirled the staff in his hand loudly scolding you bunch of useless fools you can't even defeat a level six monster watch me Yu swung his sword up standing in front to protect the Beast his eyes glinted with killing intent as he coldly looked at the captain and said all right it's not an an ordinary Beast it's my newly born battle Beast I didn't expect this Beast to be so aggressive right after being born I apologize everyone the small red dragon clumb tightly to Yu's leg desperately flattering him unfortunately for sash G he looked at the shield covered in bite marks and cried who even though we know each other business is business you have to cover the cost of repairing my shield y woo y wo replied with a smile no problem ruinan tyan looked at the adorable little dragon her eyes shining with affection she quickly ran back arms outstretched wanting to hug it could this really be the egg obtain from the Dark Forest last time it has really hatched so admirable long long I missed you so much let me give you a hug Crimson Comet saw her running towards it trembling in fear suddenly it fluffed up its fur and its face turned Fierce looking at Ruan tan tan as if it would not hold back if she took one more step Ru and Tian tyan looked at it like that quickly stopped and said dejectedly oh why are you stopping me Yu bent down patted its head and said everyone don't tease it anymore after all it's still small being a bit stubborn is very normal he looked at it seriously and instructed Crimson Comet these are all our teammates you must remember that getting patted by y wo it squinted its eyes happily w wagging its tail Non-Stop and made several sounds to show it understood from deep within the forest a loud sound emerged yiu was startled and looked over this noise startled both Lu Fang and Ruan tition Yi Wu observed for a moment and then said it seems the owner of this forest does not welcome us very much perhaps it sensed your presence crimsom Comet the red dragon held his hand tightly staring Straight Ahead the captain of the Guard team also heard that sound he calmly said why worry after the recent battle even though our numbers have decreased I feel that the monsters here are not too dangerous he placed both hands on his hips looked at yiu and suggested so let's split into two teams to search that will be more effective let's use that big tree as the final Gathering Point what do you think Young Master Yu nodded an agreement in praise that's a good arrangement if anything happens contact through the internal channel the C captain of the Guard team quickly LED his team members ahead in his heart he calculated that guy definitely has issues I used all my strength just now yet he easily dodged his strength is definitely not just level six splitting up first and then quietly following them is the best decision as they ventured deeper into the forest Ruan tanan excitedly looked around and said it's my first time exploring the dungeon I'm both excited and nervous moreover this dungeon looks like a a fairyland in the dark Forest don't you all think so Yu spoke up fatty you have a rich knowledge use your years of experience as an artifact Hunter to analyze this sa G thought for a moment and then said you all asked right on my blind spot the job of an artifact Hunter is to seek out old relics not the dungeons unless there's detailed guidance we usually do not go into the dungeons only the major corporate teams can access the new dungeons at this point C G paused for a moment and then continued his analysis however the worlds Within These dungeons are divided into many types and themes there are dungeons where we must run into the map penetrating into areas not well understood for instance the dungeon the forest has many traps and dangerous plants this is the exploration system risking and surviving he paused and then added on the other hand the survival system is another type of dungeon like entering dark caves filled with traps and poisonous mushrooms there there are large scale battles with a vast number of harmful creatures or the slaughter mode system players will face gigantic and fierce monsters having to fight to survive meanwhile the puzzle system focuses more on testing intelligence in these dungeons players will enter dark Chambers to solve puzzles or explore ancient mysterious books ye wo excitedly talked about the dungeons no matter the type until now no one has been able to explain explain the reasons for the dungeon's appearance and their operating principles if we can figure it out then we can adapt and harness it to make ourselves stronger hearing this Ruan tianan smiled with squinted eyes and said excitedly I didn't expect there to be so many types of dungeons although dangerous it's also very interesting if there were a magical girl themed dungeon that would be great suddenly a terrifying gal echoed from behind causing ruing Tian Tian to freeze in place and tremble it was the Roar of a level 40 Spinosaurus crimsom Comet was unafraid and swiftly charged forward slamming into the beast's mouth causing it to Howl in pain as its Health dropped to 50% seeing crimsom Comet Savor once Ruan tyen tyan felt grateful and said I'm sorry long long it was my carelessness thank you for saving me heu prays well done Crimson Comet this kit is in your hands the little dragon nodded fixing its Gaze on the Beast before it letting out a Roar as if it understood the command the spinosaurus became ferocious licking its lips and growling angrily you filthy Beast I will devour you whole ywu stared in amazement at the dinosaur in front of him and exclaimed can dinosaur speak human language Toth kit was also sweating with astonishment stammering isn't it just making some strange sounds suddenly the robot beside them appeared and said Master because you and the Crimson Comet have linked Souls the basic attributes and abilities of the two of you are shared that's why you could understand the language of dragons y Wu nodded sexet wait shared basic attributes couldn't it be the robot cheerfully continued here it seems the master has figured it out you and I both use the linked class system simply put if your level is this mine will be the same also depending on which account you switch to my attributes and appearance will change accordingly hearing this yiu smiled this is interesting right now I'm using the account the Chen Emperor so your attribute is fire right the Crimson Comet nodded its eyes weily fixed on the spinosaurus in front of them it emitted a growl as if to warn the spinosaurus Furious charged with its sharp claws roaring die you worthless scum the crimson red dragon the Crimson comet skillfully dodged the spinosaurus claws then swiftly jumped up and struck hard at the opponent's mouth this unexpected attack caused the spinosaurus Health points to drop to 40% it ground its teeth in Anger scolding these kids really are something their attacks are just so boring techniques like these are completely ineffective now suddenly the red dragon noticed it was speaking and abruptly stopped looking at itself a sense of forboding enveloped the Crimson comet it snorted not understanding what the spinosaurus intended to do without warning the spinosaurus curved its body whipping its tail at the red dragon saying right now I am angry at that moment the Crimson Comet was struck down onto a branch and then fell to the ground emitting painful growls Ruan tyen Tian seeing the red dragon knocked down shouted in panic long long SE G beside her also looked at it with worry saying the size and level of the Crimson Comet are vastly different if we don't help now I fear before he could finish his sentence yiu appeared raising his hand to stop them when he saw they were about to assist the Crimson Comet he coldly stated hold on no one is to intervene Ruan Tian Tian looked at him in shock asking why if we just let it Yu replied seriously as my dragon if it needs help with something as trivial as this then even if it dies it wouldn't be worth pity SAA G looked at him not knowing what to say and could only low a sigh Ruan tyen Tan's eyes brimmed with tears as she complained so heartless Yu firmly believed if I've resonated on the same level as you there's no way I can be defeated by a monster of this caliber this wolf in sheep's clothing style is very much my own at that moment the large tree sh violently a loud crack echoed look looking down yiu saw the Crimson Comet desperately gnawing at the tree's roots seemingly intent on uprooting the entire tree the spinosaurus looked at the red dragon sneering yeah the kid really is a kid L and only knows how to vent on a piece of wood haha unexpectedly after lifting the large tree the Crimson Comet quickly shot upward and struck Spinosaurus hard on the head with it it was utterly astonished in just one move its Health points dropped to 35% % infuriated the spinosaurus roared damn it you dare to sneak attack me I'll chew you into pieces and leave no bones behind just as it roared suddenly a powerful force descended from above knocking it to the ground causing it to spit blood its Health points decreased to 30% immediately afterward large trees were continuously rained down upon the spinosaurus it couldn't evade them merely enduring the assault and moaning ah damn damn it stop after a fierce battle several lumps swell up on Spinosaurus 's head it endures the pain and stands up from the pile of trees angrily saying it's useless these attacks are nothing but a scratch to me just wait until I get free that's when you'll die however its Health points at this moment are only down to 10% just then the Crimson Comet flying in the sky opened its mouth and Unleashed a torent of fire down on spinos aurus the explosive Fire Dragon Ball engulfed Spinosaurus in Flames causing it to wriggle and scream hot hot what do you want to do the red dragon had already pulled out a knife and fork and was licking its lips while looking at Spinosaurus like a Sumptuous meal happily exclaiming roasted meat Spinosaurus was burned Black by the Flames furiously shouting you Beast ah its Health points have now dropped to zero seeing that it was annihilated the Crimson Comet joyfully hummed suddenly everyone here was leveled up Lu Fang looked at his hands in Surprise this I leveled up the system displayed Lu Fang level 16 Ru and T and tan was equally excited as the system announced she achieved level 13 she happily said great I have to thank long long Sai sha G was astonished pointing at the red dragon and asked am I hearing things did that kid just mention grilled meat Yu stood with his arms crossed proudly replied no you heard it right that is indeed the case I was also wondering why it used this method of attack then I realized that both the tree trunk and the flower branches have a special fragrance clearly a kind of highquality seasoning he happily asked everyone so be you all smell the grilled meat everyone indeed smelled The Fragrant grilled meat Sai show G's eyes lit up and his mouth watered to the point that he had to wipe it with his hand he excitedly said with my many years of experience in Gourmet appreciation this must be a high-ass delicacy luu Fang's face also brightened exclaiming so that's why it smells so good ruin tyen tyen couldn't help it either drul was flowing down as she stared ahead and said so it turns out long long is also a foodie Crimson Comet took the best piece of meat and brought it in front of Yu making a haha sound as if inviting him to eat Yu smiled looked looking at it and said oh is this meat prepared for me he patted its head praising not bad not bad very considerate good job Crimson Comet wagged its head happily squinting and calling out ER you looked at everyone and spoke up everyone is hungry let's have a meal first before we set off hearing this everyone eagerly responded the system notification rang out congratulations Master you have unlocked The Gourmet m barbecue Spinosaurus crispy on the outside tender on the inside emitting an intoxicating Aroma of flavor don't just eat the meat the ribs are the essence after eating endurance will increase by 40% congratulations on achieving the accomplishment grilled meat paired with wine bring me the wine on the other side the security team leader and the team members were hiding in the bushes in the distance also smelling the enticing scent of grilled meat everyone exchanged glances is murmuring this Aroma of grilled meat is too tempting it suddenly makes the toasted bread in hand not smell good anymore this is the Temptation Of The Devil don't look don't smell so annoying it really does smell good the teen leader sitting in front was munching on bread and after listening to them chatter for a while he amily shouted shut up wait until the mission is done and once we get paid you can eat whatever you want they saw the captain so angry sweat pouring out more and hurriedly replied yes sir in his heart he was angrily cursing what can be done how long has it been why hasn't the boss arrived yet his face showed a fierce expression grinding his teeth in Anger this kid looks more and more extraordinary I am definitely not his match he thought to himself whether I can get the reward from that kid or not depends on her the boss looked at the black hole in space in front of him angrily kicking the communication device to Pieces how could we set the dungeon in such a deserted Place ma to stood with his hands on his hips saying with interest this suits me just fine it's just right to catch everything in one net like fish in a barrel so let's start the hunt crimsom Comet led the way ahead his face full of Pride at the compliments from C show G I didn't expect this road to be so smooth I didn't even have a chance to take action every Beast we encountered was killed by Crimson Comet just perfect Ruland tan Tian and LU Fang also took turns praising following long long not only means there's meat to eat but it's also so easy to level up by 10 levels long long long live the boss's Dragon Battle is just too good I want one too SAA G heard Lu Fang say that and immediately reminded I advise you to abandon that idea the dragon combat pet itself is already incredibly rare not to mention raising it to a high level it is not something you can take on Dragon combat pets are like the Crimson Comet born able to Battle Above their level against beasts only y wo can manage to raise one luang also agreed yes yes a chosen one like the boss Dragon combat pet should be of this caliber Yu seeing everyone praising him joked hey hey you guys are exaggerating a bit seems like everyone has already used to me pulling tricks sa G was silent for a moment when suddenly an idea flashed in his mind I just thought of a place where we can make money Yu's eyes sparkled upon hearing about money where can we make money speak quickly SE G replied on the grassland there is a ruin called the beast Arena after a certain period a competition called the strongest battle pet competition is held here just as the name suggests this competition is for pets to contest their strength determine the strongest the prize for the champion is incredibly generous sh G said besides money there are many rare props here and you can even obtain legendary equipment therefore this place has attracted all kinds of people from all directions and has become a very Lively activity y woo curious to learn more asked is there such an activity this world is indeed vast and Rich far beyond what I ever thought Cal Ren G patted guo on the shoulder and said I believe with the strength of crimson Comet we could certainly make a big profit what do you think next time to accumulate more rewards we should go Harvest something big you would nodded in agreement thinking to himself maybe I can seize this opportunity to obtain some rare props to build an important base the most important thing is that I need to expand my knowledge of this world staying in the safe zone for too long means not getting updated information Lu Fang and Ruan tyen tyan were also excited to join I want to go to boss you have to take me along luu Fang said I want to go too Ru and tan Tian chimed in Yi Wu suddenly noticed two particularly rare elite individuals observing the entire team from afar he thought to himself oh after following all this way you finally shown yourselves ha the Crimson Comet quickly spewed fire toward the two causing ruin Tian Tian to panic shell long what's happening the Crimson comets attack snap the tree trunk where they were hiding the two exceptionally rare Elites exchanged angry glances have we been discovered how could this be they drew their bows and shot towards Yu but to their surprise he caught the Arrows with one hand and laughed loudly the method of attack with this weapon is too primitive Yu snapped the arrows in half and continued if you want to kill me this method is not enough looking at the two ambushers below he asked who are you why you have hostile intentions towards us Sao G also stepped forward probing could it be that you are locals of this dungeon y w wondered locals are also known as NPCs right say G explained usually dungeons themed around beasts do not feature humans only in extremely rare cases will local inhabitants appear yiu folded his arms looking at the two exceptionally rare beasts and said it seems that you've activated your Emperor blood lineage again what makes locals different from others the attributes of the natives are often linked to the type of dungeon although each is different they all share one common point they are forever preserved in their original state simply put they are Immortal everyone was very surprised by the information that c Reni had just provided Immortal this is truly something special ruin Tian tyan expressed great interest great preserving you forever is the dream of all young girls T Ren G laughed and clarified quite the opposite this aspect is not good at all natives are extremely rare in the dungeon but they themselves cannot leave it when encountering outsiders with high power their fate is often very tragic they may either be taken out of the dungeon or sold for a high price to human traffickers otherwise they might end up sold to research agencies to become test subjects looking at the two rare natives in front of him although their faces were not clearly visible their stature and quality had earned them the four words topnotch undoubtedly making others eager to fight over them hearing this the two rare natives also felt very worried about their fate Yi Wu sighed feeling depressed people will do anything for profit he said consider yourselves lucky Al Lough I like money at least I have my limits I will absolutely not do anything that crosses the line like human trafficking you should go if you want live find a place to hide well there are not just a few of us here the two local people still tried to argue on what basis should I listen to a person from another world like you the ones who should leave are the foreign people like you this clean secure Forest absolutely will not allow you to destroy it the Divine Beast beside also said that's not wrong Mio y Wu looked straight at the two local people who were still being arrogant and seriously said people from another world that's true to you we are Outsiders but I after all am the one who opened this dungeon strictly speaking everything here belongs to me and you are also mine therefore what I think is what it is it's not your turn to be in charge Yi Wu drew his sword stepping closer to the two local people they fearfully retreated I don't care if you are local NPCs or the Saints of the Jungle those who obstruct me have only one ending death seeing you w very serious his face Fierce like a demon the strike he Unleashed were like Flames burning y Wu looked at their frightened expressions and chuckled just like that you all were startled and ran away your levels may be hidden but your mentality is too immature and cowardly perhaps it's because you've never interacted with humans understandable so don't blame me for being cruel consider it a lesson I'm teaching you for the first time in your lives because in this world not everyone is kindhearted the two natives ran quite a distance and only when they felt safe did they stop to discuss one of them said that person just now was clearly only level six yet why is he so strong we better not provoke him the other agreed adding The Killing intent on him is really terrifying a moment longer and we'd probably be dead by now both of them breathed heavily sitting down to rest suddenly they heard voices looking up they saw three figures with Fierce Expressions one of the three laughed loudly haha it's worth the trip here to meet such a valuable item like this we're about to get rich brothers let's go the two natives panicked exclaiming who are you they felt extremely upset that their peaceful place was no longer safe as before one side what on Earth has happened to this world suddenly for over a thousand years it has always been peaceful why are there so many Outsiders invading now one person said Kai XI stop overthinking Mio ba said first we have to fight back against those guys the three strangers looked kayaki up and down and teased this girl has an extraordinary figure I wonder what her face looks like under that mask but surely can't be ugly another one spoke up whether she's ugly or beautiful doesn't matter just take off that headscarf A Primitive girl like her pure until now is truly rare Ki angry rushed forward to duel you are all Shameless scum die seeing that they became even more interested one teas oh she has quite a fiery temper come here let us show you just how cruel this world can be another one laughed heartily interjecting haha just don't hit too hard she's important merchandise if you break her she won't be worth it the battle began these three were all members of the Guard team with levels of 22 25 and 28 respectively however they were no match for the two locals and were quickly defeated that was too fast one murmured moreover it only took one blow to finish them off at first I only noticed that she was a woman forgetting this is a level 40 Dungeon KAG looked at her defeated opponents in disappointment what on Earth is wrong with you she said at such a high level yet not as good as that level six human that level six human was not good unable to Dodge in time fortunately for the guardian team member just as Kai XI was was about to unleash a fatal blow another figure came to the rescue in time it was a beautiful girl holding a rifle shooting at kik's attack to save that guy the girl said on the battlefield one should not be days the guardian was still trembling as he replied yes that is me too level 85 I never expected that we a bunch of useless trash we be lucky enough to encounter such rare natives recognizing a familiar face the guardian joyfully exclaimed boss you finally arrived boss is majestic now that you are here I will leave this matter to you a useless person like me will not interfere my two signaled for him to step aside then get out of the way and watch let me handle this seeing her approach kakai thought to herself her level is 85 and her Aura is very dangerous she must have killed many people I have no chance of winning so I should not confront her headon but rather look for an opportunity to escape just as she was preparing to flee kakai heard me's loud laughter want to run then she shot bullets around kexi creating a circle that tightly locked both of them in kaixi said no one can disappear right before my eyes unless they are dead stand still for me or you will pay with your life but if so you won't be worth anything anyway suddenly a reptile appeared behind Kai XA as soon as she saw it she screamed Mio ba get away Kai XI quickly pushed Mio ba away hoping she could Escape safely while being trapped in the cage that was the Forbidden skill Lightroom level 60 which could last for 60 seconds on the other side Mio B seeing her teammate captured angrily shouted damn it kxc I'm coming to save you seeing Mio baow about to rush into saver kakai hurriedly said don't come here Mio baow don't worry about me just run away she's too strong we can't win run now Mio ba cried out of worry for kexa but quickly ran to find help Kai XI wait for me I will go find a vill for assistance we can't let that person run wild meanwhile the guard hiding in the shadows me too looked at the chaotic beasts and muttered that foolish Lackey there's no need to chase after them its Master is already in our hand hands it will return sooner or later there are many other things for you to do ma two said in a moment give her the anesthetic and take her to the secret hideout remember I want her intact not a scratch on her the henchman scratched his head apologetically and replied yes yes I won't make this kind of low-level mistake again boss rest assured hearing Yu's name Mau recalled what mioa had said about him and suddenly felt a bit intrigued she asked what kind of person is this Yu this dungeon was opened by him what is his strength the guard began to explain at first I thought he was just a second generation rich kid but the more I accompanied him the more I realized his strength is beyond measure although he hasn't made a direct move his battle dragon can fight on par with a level 50 Warrior absolutely not an ordinary person my to chuckled lightly oh that's somewhat interesting the guard kill serously asked boss what exactly is this y Woo's background why do the big bosses want to capture him at all costs my too Shrugged this is a secret place I'm not quite clear myself the higher ups ordered to capture him live if that's not possible killing him is fine too but to be honest capturing him alive is more interesting than killing him it excites me a bit while the two were discussing how to find y Wu at another location Yu was also curi serously standing in front of a large tree that ancient tree looks a bit unusual from a distance it appears very large and as you get closer it obscures the entire Sky if there are no Treasures on this tree I sincerely apologize to the one who created it Lu Fang and Ruan tyen tyan are still proud of their level up they easily reached level 30 without much effort and even got new equipment if the people at school see this they will definitely be envious haha Fang said happily Ruan T tan was also excited thank goodness fora long from y Wu you are indeed a great assistant suddenly the crimsom comet growled twice as if it had discovered something and rushed towards the source of the noise Ru and Ty and tan hurriedly followed sh long what's going on that you're in such a hurry y Wu realize this was due to Mio bow so he quickly intervened with the Crimson Comet it's nothing then he turned to look towards the noise and said show yourself you wouldn't come all the way here without fear of danger unless there was something urgent to find me Mio ba raised both hands in a gesture of surrender your eyes are really sharp I came here alone because my master is in danger Ruan Tian tyan looked at Mio ba with delight surprised that this cat could speak human language she exclaimed so adorable Mio ba was taken aback and flustered to see its identity exposed it cried out what so you all know I'm a cat I clearly disguised myself perfectly C Reni laughed mockingly foolish one hiding your head but exposing your tail that's right it was your own mouth that betrayed You Mio ba blushed and hurriedly corrected m m i mean M damn it even if you've discovered my true identity so what aren't you going to hurry and save my friend hearing this everyone felt both pity and amusement at Mi Bow's pleading attitude but this cat seemed a bit arrogant as if commanding them one person in the group joked ha is this how you beg for help let's see how I should collect you then y Wu looked at Mio ba and said your master has been captured by a group of bearded men helping you isn't out of the question the key is what benefit do I get from it Mio ba stood with hands on hips negotiating with Y wo of course I won't let you work for free m I'll give you the Mio ba finished speaking and took out a red stone yiu looked at the stone her eyes instantly shining this Stone was very beautiful sparkling brightly y Wu quickly recognized its value this is an ancient demonic Essence Crystal she said although it's only level 40 its quality is epic where did you get this Mi ba Shrugged lightly as if unconcerned just this one stone alone is far from enough yiu looked at Mio ba and couldn't help but scoff are you going to reveal anything else don't tell me this is the only Stone you have Mio B Shrugged again pretending to be innocent who told you there's only this one piece me the stone sparkled so much that it dazzled anyone who looked at it Yi Wu looked at the crowd in front of him with suspicion while Mi ba confidently declared my cat has a mountain of treasures as long as you help me they will belong to you hearing this everyone gasped in amazing however yiu remained skeptical and said so much you seem to be talking nonsense you're not trying to deceive me are you these suspicious words made Mio bow visibly upset hateful humans don't compare me to your kind how could I possibly do something as Despicable as that yigu was not in a hurry to believe he pointed directly at Mio Bal presenting the final condition how about this aren't you a cat then show me your real face and I will help you Mio ba panicked you you want me to do such a humiliating thing you might as well kill me seeing this ye W turned away as if to leave speaking coldly if you can't do that then we won't discuss it anymore bye-bye Mio ba immediately broke out in a sweat anxiously calling him back wait don't leave so soon please give me a chance seeing that Yu was unwilling to negotiate further and was determined to walk away Mio ba had no choice but to kneel KN down and plead earnestly good brothers and sisters please save my friend I beg you Ruan tyen tyan saw Mio Ba's face flushed as if about to cry and hurriedly ran over to couble and comfort so adorable I like you very much me baow coughed choked meow meow Hub me so tightly that I can't breathe at that moment Lu Fang and C sh G couldn't help but feel moved Ruan tyen tyan continued to hold on laughing as she said is is that enough hucking now it's my turn even though I've encountered many Fierce and lovely cats before this one is truly different perhaps this is a mutation Gene at this moment Nao ba fluffed up in protest beautiful girl I can endure this but you worthless men don't even think about touching a single hair of mine yiu approached knelt down to look at Mio ba with a tender gaze with such an obviously adorable look why you always present a fierce to meaner Mio B stood timidly before Yu but still tried to appear proud Yu said out of respect for your intentions I'll keep my word and help you this time seeing him agree Mio ba was very happy but seemed displeased when Yu patted her head what was that you just did Yu commanded the system activate Hawkeye the system confirmed successfully activated surveillance range has covered the entire instance he Wu quickly discovered a Target a level 85 player just entered considered the leader behind them Finally Revealed himself SE sha G eagerly urged come on brother don't you want to go rescue the owner of that little cat Mio bow huffed and shouted that's a teammate you fat dude y Wu crossed his arms and said no need the enemy has delivered themselves right to our doorstep saving us time seemingly still not grasping y's Point c g curiously asked delivered to our doorstep what do you mean at that moment me too thinking herself clever laughed haha you guys are truly a bunch of novices by following the traces from the battle we can easily locate their position but perhaps they didn't expect that there would be someone hunting them from behind as soon as she finished speaking me too realized she had almost fallen into a trap she jolted damn that was close almost got caught she pondered is this an attack from the dungeon or from y wo's group at that moment y wo and his teammates appeared the surprises don't stop there as a dog from behind attempted to Ambush but I countered it first realizing that the person he was searching for was standing right in front of him you are y wo was that last move yours what a surprising first meeting truly unexpected astonished by Yu's ability to recognize him M to thought to himself this guy is spy on I was cloaked and had clearly used my invisibility skill how did he manage to discover me Yu cheerfully responded thank you for the compliment but I didn't expect this I originally intended to use it because the captain was coming to fish and yet I truly caught a big fish moreover it's the head of a mermaid this kid not only has great judgment but also a sweet tongue making my too feel quite intrigued approaching closer May too teased a mermaid huh yum man your tongue is really sweet did you coat it with honey but the mermaid in your words if not satisfied seems like she would eat people right y Wu was unbothered and replied satisfaction how would you like to satisfy my water Pond if I definitely cannot satisfy a big fish like you then which Pond exactly are you from is it Wang Jen T and sang or another one my two was quite surprised oh I didn't expect you to be so perceptive and you managed to guess this much since you are a smart guy I will be straightforward I am me too a mercenary recruiter belonging to the Huang Jen group my two continued the reason I came here is to recruit you to join the Huang Jen group what do you think about this Yu look surprised you traveled this far just to recruit me but you should know that I have already joined the hanmo group yiu candidly admitted causing Mau to start pondering the words of the captain indeed Lan King Yun guessed correctly the battle with different AA revealed Yu's strength making him the center of attention for major corporations even though she received unwelcome information Mau did not give up desperately trying to entice him the financial power of the Huang Jang group is not inferior to that of hanm Mo if you agree to join the conditions will be entirely up to you I guarantee you will not be disappointed this is our complete sincerity yiu replied straightforwardly without hesitation how coincidental because what I hate the most is betrayal therefore I refuse Yu's answer left my too somewhat taken a back but she quickly replied coldly very decisive but it seems you do not recognize the situation at hand in my style after you refuse you will have to die with that may 2 pulled out her gun and pointed it directly at IU's head however yubu showed no signs of fear and even provoked her oh really perhaps I should thank you then my too said I usually wouldn't do this but I feel that you joining Guang Jen and working together would be very interesting so I'll give you another chance the choice is yours yiu still smiled and replied I still refuse my to felt what a Pity she did not want to eliminate y wo as she found him very worthy of collaboration she had used a puppet card to control him but unfortunately the card's usage rights had expired Yu witnessed everything and exclaimed just as the rumors say your egg is a man eating fish in the blink of an eye I must admit you are very interesting but it's truly a Pity unwilling to give up NAU quickly used an advanced puppet card y Wu immediately guessed but this puppet card is also undetectable by Hawkeye it seems the opponent is using a puppet card of a level surpassing the ordinary identification skills making them dismissive however May to thought still too young do you think you could take the initiative to engage in close combat I originally wanted to impart practical combat experience to you but unfortunately you will have to die she swiftly executed a special snapping technique paired with specially crafted ammunition the most terrifying aspect of the shooting was that it made no sound at all leaving the opponent unable to react in time even without hearing The Gunshot yiu still felt something is off my instincts warn me that danger is imminent Yu was trying to feel what that sensation was when he suddenly heard a growl it turned out that sha long had rushed out to take the bullet for him even though Yu screamed to stop him it was already too late at that moment the emergency system announced the battle companion Crimson comet has activated the dragon family's innate ability y Wu painfully huged Crimson Comet tightly blaming himself for being too engrossed in fighting the Demon beast and not paying attention to the smiper behind previously when fa facing the demon Beast everything went smoothly causing y woo to momentarily forget that in battles against humans especially highlevel opponents there are always many dangerous factors that he failed to anticipate this carelessness led to a fatal mistake the whole group felt heartbroken when they saw Crimson Comet gasping for breath seemingly on the verge of death Ruan Ty and Ty could not contain her emotions and wanted to rush out to save cha long but Lu Fang immediately sh it to stop her are you going out there to Die the opponent is at a high level if you just poke your head out you'll definitely be killed right away at this moment C sha G also realized the situation and reassured Don't Panic sha long still has a little HP left Yu will definitely be able to save him trust him Yu quickly opened the support system using an ultra recovery potion on Crimson Comet while gently comforting drink this you'll recover soon watching Crimson Comet gradually regain strength the whole group breathed the sigh of relief but y wo kept reminding himself I must not make such a mistake again shell long suddenly shows good signs and gradually regains Consciousness seeing you full of energy like this I feel relieved you truly are my battle pet even though you almost lost your life you still did not back down my twoo is trying to stop me from attacking wanting to use fireworms to suppress the area and hinder me but that that's too Nave this kind of indiscriminate attack can't possibly make me lose a drop of blood Yu stands calmly within the support Circle causing Mau to constantly Ponder in the past he was lucky enough to avoid a fatal blow and now he dares to remain still is he ultimately confident or just looking for death no matter how much support you have how long can you hold on I have overestimated you I thought you were powerful but in the end you were just a child let me break your support first Yu said while talking to EXA long I didn't realize that the support was down to 20% I'm sorry for you Crimson Comet it was all due to my momentary overconfidence that caused you to suffer in the past I relied on the Shadow King to defeat a level 90 Elite boss creating a wrong inertia mindset for myself leading to inaccurate calculations in basic strategy Yu continued right now using the Chen Emperor to connect levels we are only at level 60 while facing an opponent at level 85 clearly it has no effect previously we fought by relying on the remaining accumulation points a bit but now it's useless as well system how many points do I currently have host currently has 1.3 million points that's still a lot but the opponent is just a marksman I guess they have nothing valuable on them burning points to transform into a Shadow King would yield too low of a return the key issue is that there's no way to increase the attributes for Crimson Comet for now increasing the connection level might be more reasonable at this moment the system announced support index is only at 8% system how much experience is needed to raise might level to 10 support is at 5% currently your connection level with the chaien emperor is 55 you need to increase by 45 levels to meet the requirements The Experience value needed to level up is 1 million would you like to use 1 million the further we go the more experience points are consumed but it's okay sooner or later I'll have to use it so it's probably better to level up now while the experience points are still sufficient Yu said in this way with basic attributes at level 100 and the ability to jump up to 20 levels I will not have to fear when facing level 120 opponents the system confirms the use the system quickly confirmed confirmed beginning experience conversion immediately please wait a moment just at that moment the support dropped back to 0% my two outside was overjoyed and began to devise a plan the support is gone it's just a Nave face covering trick it's just a flaming meor I will have to use this water attribute candy you guys will die in an instant go die your head will help me get the Bounty y Wu quickly leveled up to level 10 I've encountered many kinds of women but you were the first to make me feel murderous intent Mau was extremely astonished by Yu's leveling ability he actually jumped from level six to level 10 in an instant how on Earth did he do that moreover even clearly hundreds of meters away he could still feel the warmth of the Flaming meor could this be the powerful and Eerie force of him along with the oppressive Aura of a level 100 expert what on Earth is going on I I have to retreat otherwise I won't survive Yu created opportunities for Crimson Comet to take revenge on me too I really want to personally eliminate her but she almost took your life just a moment ago therefore this chance for revenge is still entrusted to you go ahead an ey for an eye return her the favor hundredfold Crimson Comet quickly rushed in for Revenge flaming meteor spewed light pressure in beams a powerful radiation moreover bulk speed and coverage area were significantly increased on a wide scale what the hell even a beast has become this strong damn it y woo do you really want to pursue to the end do you really want to be enemies with Wong genen group you can't possibly win Mau lowered himself and said no matter what you say at this moment whether it's pleading or cursing rest assured I will bear the consequences of this myself Wong Jen will not let you go after that statement Mau was completely eliminated allowing Crimson comet to gain 50,000 experience and 100,000 in rewards for the first time shell long achieved a top score unlocked the achievement of taking out a despised enemy in one shot the items earned included a golden Desert Eagle explosive handgun this is a rare version with extraordinary power when using it remember to protect your arm because the innate ability increases damage by 100% the notification system stated the second item is a rifle designed based on the 98 K model equipped with an automatic scope and suppressor this rifle has the ability to fire in bursts with a special passive ability after hitting the first Target the bullet will continue to fly dealing standard damage to targets behind it and penetrating armor by 100% the notification system continued additionally there is a skill book named Phantom stealth that allows the user to enter a stealth State while crouched and motionless the equipment set includes 100 rounds of ammo with types water fire earth wind and thunder accompanied by smoke bombs and stunned grenades 10 of each type plus nine hunting spider robots and an unmanned cloaking Optical system battle data has been recorded automatically and you can exit any dungeon at any time besides personal rewards companions like Ruan tan L Fang and C sh G all leveled up it was amazing I also leveled up by two ranks directly the battle situation seemed to change completely in an instant achieving absolute Victory staring for too long became the norm I could only say the boss is indeed too powerful the three of them discussed laughing joyfully perhaps because they were already too familiar with the achievements of Yi Wu only Mio ba had his eyes wide open incredulous about what he had just witnessed he exclaimed Am I Dreaming this man is incredibly strong Ruan T and tan ran to hug Crimson com joyfully congratulating Crimson Comet congratulations on your Victory you are truly strong shell long was so well behaved you worried me to death Yi Wu also approached bowing his head to apologize to everyone earlier I underestimated the opponent putting cha long in danger and making everyone anxious however this kind of situation will not happen again in the future I assure you unexpectedly Mio Bal interrupted y woo looking at him with a sympathetic gaze may I ask if you still need a pet Ma I would like to nominate myself although I'm not as powerful as that dinosaur wouldn't he want to take a pet like me the group burst into laughter and Y Wu happily replied your Swift change of heart makes me dizzy too but shouldn't we go save your master now shell long beside Yu also began to get angry as someone wanted to take its place it cleared its throat and then called out me ma she just my companion I only recognized one master everyone laughed again unable to help but praise the little cat for knowing how to flatter suddenly the ground and Sky seemed to shake one of them exclaimed what was that an earthquake Sao gestured pointing in the direction he was looking everyone looked up at the tree over there that is the Naga monster level 50 everyone was puzzled why is it the boss of this dungeon could the previous battle have Destro bit Yu stood with his arms crossed gazing at the final boss of the dungeon who was also the guardian of this gigantic tree miio bow tightly huged Yu's leg trembling as he said it's not a guardian or anything meow long ago this forest was very peaceful until that three-headed monster suddenly appeared it not only took the longevity tree as its Lair but also polluted the nature and the energy of the entire Forest Mio ba recalled the image of the three-headed dragon standing at top the great tree roaring and continued most creatures in the forest were affected becoming violent and transforming into their current forms it is said that over the long years this monster has formed some kind of connection with the longevity tree but exactly what that is I've forgotten now yuu put his hands in his pockets and cly walked forward first let's not worry about what that connection is after I defeat this boss your partner can explain further me o ba looked at him in amazement thinking to herself no wonder he is the master effortlessly saying words that I would not dare to say in my entire life Lu Fang quickly ran up ahead anxiously saying boss please wait a moment I have something I want to say before he could finish yiu turned back and asked what is it Lu Fang looked at yiu seriously and said I hope you can allow me to join the upcoming battle with the boss because he paused for a moment hands clenched with determination although it is really enjoyable to win quickly on this journey the lack of highlevel practical combat experience will not be truly effective when I am by your side therefore I also want to participate in the fight Ruan Tian tyan shared the same thought as L Fang and spoke up L Fang is right I also do not want to just be a decorative vase with a rank but lacking practical combat experience you who looked at the two of them unsure of what to say at this moment C sh G stepped forward patting y woo on the shoulder and laughed brother your two younger teammates are quite good even if you grind experience points for them they still don't stop working hard that's really rare upon hearing this Yu also smile with pride of course I have a good eye for people but he turned around looked at them with a serious expression and said now is not the time my plan is for the two of you to level up first then we will go to aul real Combat experience this will ensure safety because no matter the situation survival is always the most important thing luu Fang nodded in response understood boss Ru and tienan also obediently said okay we will listen to you suddenly Nega appeared breathing fire towards them with overwhelming power it sneered facing a strong enemy and still daring to chat don't you know what it means to be alive go die Yi Wu immediately ordered Crimson Comet to Counterattack the Flames of crimson Comet quickly erupted retaliating with brilliant Sparks lighting up an entire Corner of the Sky surprisingly Crimson comet's fire was able to block the Flames emitted by the three-headed dragon Naga roared angrily how can this be my breath was just disrupted Naga was a dragon with three heads all three heads were focused on Crimson Comet discussing among themselves the red head said how can a Level 10 little beast have such power the green head expressed doubt we shouldn't underestimate them they must have something unusual the yellow head shouted angrily hemp just a bunch of tiny ants no need to be afraid Yu looked at them smirking as he said what are you scared now the scarier things are still behind he reached through the circle of the formation using Force to strike a palm strike at their heads a dragon hand appeared grabbing in the red head of the Dragon causing it to cry out in pain g g gr the Flames quickly engulf that red head the dragon crashed around screaming let me go you as the red head struggled in the Flames the dragon hand suddenly tightened its grip crushing the head the other two heads witnessing this scene immediately broke into a cold sweat and trembled they muttered one strut can do this this guy is indeed strange let's flee the system recorded Ed nega's Health at 60% y Wu looked at the dragon that had lost one head sneering you want run weren't you just being so arrogant Mio ba suddenly spoke up to stop him Master wait this monster cannot be killed yet everyone turned to look at mioa in shock cannnot kill why mioa frowned his face revealing worry as he said because I just remembered something my partner once said that this monster has a special connection with the the long it tree if we kill it right now we might miss out on something very important y Wu wondered about something very important and asked what is it is it worth the money sha G furrowed his brows and looked at Mio Bell suspiciously asking with the way you're talking unclearly and letting the boss go are you on its side are you trying to play us Mio ba broke into a sweat and hurriedly replied absolutely not you all must believe me I'm doing this for my master what it specifically is is you'll only know when you meet my partner y Wu crossed his arms and smiled saying hearing you say that makes it a bit interesting I thought this was just a normal level 40 Dungeon but it turns out there are many twists let's go everyone let's find Mio Ba's teammates he looked ahead and continued now we go rescue that girl and see what this very important thing really is Crimson Comet nodded when Yu said that all right Yu turned to Mio ba if that thing is really valuable I will make you my pet Mio baow joyfully asked really that's amazing meanwhile the captain of the Guard Squad annoyed repeatedly slapped at a mosquito angrily saying why hasn't the boss lady finished yet the captain of the Guard said next waiting in this rundown place is really boring it's driving me to death there are so many mosquitoes he looked at the girl with the alluring figure tied up in front of him growing even angrier what the hell are you cursing about an extraordinary artifact lay beside him yet he could not touch it damn it this is really torture but even if the boss doesn't allow me to touch her let's see what she looks like she must be decent right thinking this he approached with interest wanting to remove the beast's skull from her head haha let's do it this way at that moment suddenly a sound echoed thud thud he quickly turned his head to look who who's there a demon Beast appeared a level 20 Velociraptor it stuck out its tum at him shaking its head back and forth while making a noise you he Furious drew his weapon quickly and attacked it damn it you scared me half to death get out of here with your slow intelligence why are you bothering me the demon Beast quickly fled you the captain of the guards returned to the girl continuing his work damn it this is so disappointing why can't get it off it's stuck so tightly I can't be too rough what if I ruin her looks if she can't be sold then it'll be a disaster he struggled for a long time but still couldn't get the bone head off suddenly he heard a sound to goinging back thud thud thud thud he thought that the little demon Beast had returned and in Anger he picked up his weapon ready to fight he shouted damn you itching for a beating aren't you this time if I don't skin you alive then it'll be a long time coming but before he could finish cursing he was startled to see thousands of gleaming red eyes lurking in the darkness of the cave a horde of demon beasts pushed and shoved as they approached far too numerous to count the captain of the Guard stood there astonished at the dinosaur-like Swarm in front of him and yelled loudly damn it why are there so many beasts like this this quantity is simply terrifying he held two different weapons in his hands a gun and in his left hand and a baiten in his right while fending off the demon beasts he shouted get out of here what are you all coming here to die for don't come any closer the demon beasts struck by his attacks became Furious and lunged to bite at his shins in pain he screamed a my shins the demon Beast surrounding him looked at him with fiery eyes making him fearfully cry out he sister save me I don't want to die immed imediately the pack of demon beasts rushed in and tore into him everywhere the sounds of squeaking echoed throughout the cave after they had finished off the captain the demon beasts turned and moved towards the girl lying on the ground the squeaking continued to reverberate in the cold space the demon Beast surrounded her emitting incessant chirp chirp chirp sounds then they all simultaneously lifted her off the ground with their heads and carried her away they kept chirping continuously and quickly exited the cave at that moment the system announced the true ey has been renewed please check host on the screen everyone saw the image of a skull of a demon Beast moving gradually getting farther from the Cave's location then another skull appeared lying inside the cave everyone wondered did the captain die what happened was she killed by the demon Beast how could that girl clearly in a coma still move at such high speed ye woo and the others quickly r ran toward the cave luu Fang hurriedly asked how can she move when she's unconscious what kind of technology is this s g running behind him replied don't you understand this situation indicates that the girl has been captured by the demon beast yiwu turned to Mio ba who was leading the way and asked cat what do you think Mio ba hesitated before answering no it's not a demon Beast then it seriously continued it seems to be in existence even more evil than a demon Beast even more than the nagab boss y Wu thought to himself even more formidable than the boss of the dungeon clone couldn't it be that the secret path of this dungeon is similar to how the young girl inquired about levels who would have thought that a seemingly ordinary level 40 Dungeon would have such Rich content making it quite interesting meanwhile kayaki slowly opened her eyes looking at the strange scenery around her she was still unaware of where she was and loudly questioned where is this it seems she felt like she had been taken by a pack of dinosaurs to a place for a sacrificial ritual and she herself was the chosen offering kayaki immediately sat up weily scanning her surroundings then shouted damn it how did I end up here after saying that she stood up peering into the woods ahead where sacrificial beds were set up she wondered wasn't I knocked unconscious by that person how did I end up in such a dangerous place could could it be that she suspects me I'm sure this is some kind of trick devised by that guy thinking this she turned around and ran away from this dangerous place mentally assuring herself to stay calm I must leave quickly absolutely cannot let that guy catch me suddenly a demon Beast leaped out in front of her blocking her path H exi was startled momentarily stopping in her tracks and worriedly thought it's over she looked around cautiously and raised her head immediately spotting a man standing at top a large demon Beast arms crossed gazing at her before speaking this is the 10th time Kay exi every time I save you in return you say nothing just silently slip away it truly breaks my heart however as I mentioned before I've given you 10 chances to escape he paused for a moment staring intently at the girl his lips curling up you've used up all your chances you should obediently stay by my side you were not allowed to go anywhere anymore the information on him displayed on the system was a vill leveled temporarily not updated kakai looked at him for a moment then hurriedly turned and ran in the opposite direction as she ran she shouted who would listen to your foolishness he watched C except F but did not rush to chase her merely snapped his fingers and called out I won't let you go do you think you can easily run away as before as soon as the sound of his finger snap echoed the group of dinosaurs around them immedi immediately took orders quickly surrounding her in layers the sounds of chirping filled the space ail stepped forward smiling as he looked at kayaki kxi accept your mission the group of dinosaurs saw him approaching and immediately moved aside to make way for him as kakai walked he spoke why is it that in this world full of demon beasts only the two of us exist do you still not understand the reasoning behind this when she saw him getting closer she stepped back raised her hands taking a defensive stance and shouted I hate you you have a smell that makes people disgusted I do not want to Bear children with you oille hearing her words was not in a hurry to get angry he closed his eyes furrowed his brow and patiently replied it's been over a thousand years yet your way of thinking remains so outdated bear children I have absolutely no interest in that the only purpose I want to unite with you is for one single goal his face turned Fierce his eyes wide with excitement as he said that is to gain power plus the three fruits of a thousand years from the longevity tree I can achieved the power to break through this world saying that he raised his face to the sky and yelled a this damn world frustrates me so much it's too small too cramped I increasingly feel suffocated clearly there exists a larger vaster more Splendid World outside but I can only stay in this Forest living in a realm no larger than 100 miles for a, thousand dark years the whole of his body tensed with rage I hate I hate so much immediately after he suddenly Advanced pinning kakay down and continued however now the opportunity has come suddenly being pressed to the ground Kai gexi panicked and cried out ah he looked at her excitedly saying in the past the otherworldly beings that invaded have completely confirmed my thousand-year-old hypothesis I have also tried to pass through their spatial door but he recalled the strange Circle that blocked him preventing him from entering the other side grinning savagely he continued it seems there is an invisible law restricting me keeping me from breaking through he became frantic looking at Kai XI and laughed saying so I need your power killing those otherworldly beings maybe I can break through this limitation and reach the outside world ha Avil tightened his grip on Kai XI making her unable to move she could only weakly utter ah let me go witnessing all of this yiu Stood Beside looking at evil and Kai xie smiling as he said what a splendid explanation I've harvested something interesting the character in the dungeon has awakened Consciousness and even wants to break through limitations to reach the outside world of the dungeon how fascinating he smirked if you were a kind person perhaps I would lead you out to meet the outside world but now ail was startled to see Yu's men just arriving seeing Mio Bell gritting his teeth while looking at him he immediately stood up frowned and said to Yu haha what can you do to me now Yu looked at him coldly replying is there a need to say more yiu drove his sword his eyes icy and smiled at ail the fate of evildoers usually only has one outcome ail furrowed his brow responding I don't quite understand the characters in the game you're referring to but you all have come to me voluntarily actually saving me quite a bit of effort he pulled out a cold blade and continued what surprises me even more is that people like you from another world could escape the grasp of the three-headed Naga dragon with that ail launched an attack he shouted this is as far as it goes before absolute power you are as weak as weeds the blade in ail's hand instantly transformed into a gigantic shape swinging down heavily towards y wo ywu managed to raise his sword to block the blow threatening words upon his lips but secretly calculating to Ambush however the force from Mill's blow startled ywu his eyes widening in shock no way this power he was forcefully pushed back several meters deep imprints of Yu's shoes were left on the ground because he had to exert strong force to keep his body steady the power exceeded Yu's expectations causing his heal points to drop to only 80% he was astonished to real realized that just one blow had knocked off 20% of his health even though he had reached level 100 by now ail rode to top a large demon Beast holding a chain and a sword looking at yiu with a condescending gaze he said sneak attack no I just didn't want to dirty my hands my soul is connected to my Mount so my abilities and its are the same Avil introduced his demon Beast to Yu's group Jade Incubus Mount at a level yet to be determined all o it to fight you is already the greatest gift Yi Wu voiced his sword onto his shoulder gazing up at aille with calm eyes replying I must admit you are indeed quite strong I am very curious about your exact rank someone like you surely has no reason to hide their true strength y Wu provocatively asked so since you still have many questions in your heart not just regarding ail's rank but also about the mysterious girl accompanying him her rank remains an enigma is there some special mechanism hidden in this battle ail showed no emotion uttering the foolish words after undergoing thousands of Trials my strength can no longer be assessed by a bunch of numbers with that he mounted the demon beast and charged forward ail mocked go ahead and die for me at that moment suddenly a crimson common appeared piercing the head of the Jade Incubus the demon Beast cried out in pain its health bar dropping down to 80% the Jade incubates shot a furious glare at Yu as if Flames were shooting out of its eyes seeing this Yi Wu thought to himself that took down 20% of the opponent's Health watching the Crimson Comet quickly land on the ground and run away Yu speculated this indicates that that guy is indeed at the same level as me a rather hardto believe coincidence the Crimson Comet leaned down to look at Yu emitting a chirping sound Yu looked up at the red dragon and asked Crimson Comet do you mean you want me to ride on your back images flashed in Yu's mind of himself wielding a sword riding on the back of a small Dragon this image made him feel a bit diminished in stature and he really didn't dare to look directly Yu forced a smile and said well let's wait until you grow up before we consider that seeing y Wu just standing there scratching his head and refusing to climb on the Crimson comment expressed disappointment letting out a long howl oh woo ail was riding on the head of the large demon Beast which was still dazed in Swain and said you actually managed to stun my Mount you got some skill there in Yu's mind Fox began to swirl as he contemplated why a level 100 character appeared in a level 40 Dungeon if they were at the same level as him this was truly unreasonable Yu stood there deep in thought while it is possible to battle head-on a bold idea suddenly struck him he handed a recovery po potion to SEO G and instructed fatty go provoke him to draw the aggro onto yourself but do not use a life-saving skill if you can't hold out drink the potion right away SI sh G looked worried and asked again no life-saving skill one hit from him already took away 20% of my health if it continues like this won't I get killed in just one hit Yu quickly reassured him trust my judgment hearing this c g took the potion and replied got it although this is no different from heading to my death I trust you after putting away the potion C sh G charged towards ail mocking him vigorously hey you crazy freak you waste your efforts to grab my attention fine I'm here to satisfy you today ail enraged turned his demon Beast around and charged at SI G shouting you little brat do you want to die seeing the Jade Incubus charging towards him C show G quickly took out his shield to block he wondered to himself damn it and I really withstand this blow if I misjudge I won't let him off even as a ghost a loud explosion echoed boom so sh G was thrown back his health bar dropped to 80% he held the shield defensively surprise what's going on this strike was easier to fend off than I imagined I didn't even need to activate my life saving skill and my health has only dropped by 20% the level of this guy doesn't seem to match mine ye woo and the others stood nearby watching the situation unfold he guessed correctly this guy inde has a special leveling mechanism it must be the type that locks emity with opponents of the same level otherwise that last attack though it didn't defeat him would definitely have left the fat guy with no more than 3% Health seeing the JD cubis punched the shield without hurting c g yiu noted in fact this guy seems unaware of his own abilities if he did he would lock on to me with emity and then take down everyone else luang asked Bost can I go help I don't want to stand here and do nothing yiu handed him his sword and said of course you should go help take this the system displayed a message Tristan's Dragon slang sword a one-handed sword with special attack and defense abilities against the demon beast dragon family when killing a demon beast dragon family players have a high chance of receiving rare items luu Fang was stunned when he saw this sword excitedly asking wow is this a legendary weapon can I use it Yi Wu glanced at him and replied you can trade for it with the fat guy next you will provoke some hatred don't you want to accumulate experience in real Combat this is a great opportunity Lu Fang happily responded got it after being gloy for so long I can finally unleash my full potential sa G who was supporting himself while applying self-healing medicine shouted loudly ye woo are you joking this guy's level is probably on par with mine while I can hold my own against him Lu Fang is only level 36 isn't that just pushing him into a dead end Lu Fang Dunning armor and wielding the sword charged forward to replace C shell G he confidently said don't worry about me fat guy the boss won't hurt me at all I just need to follow his orders ail's eyes seemed to go wild as he laughed maniacally they actually sent a low-level trash to seek death let's see how I can beat him to the point of being dazed he quickly struck towards Lu Fang yelling loudly I will help you Lu Fang's Health points dropped to 70% however he was still excited thinking to himself only 30% of health Lost I'm still very strong without hesitation Lu Fang used his sharp sword to chop off the tail of the Jade Incubus haha no wonder it's a good weapon not only is it sharp but it also has a special effect against the Dragon family haha the Jade Incubus screamed in pain howling miserably g g g g aille standing from a distance angrily shouted how can this be a level 36 trash not only blocked my attack but could also chop off a dragon's tail with one strike the eyes of the Jade Incubus turned red drooling it kept poing its eyes filled with fear could it be he is hiding his true strength is he the strongest one here Kai exen next to him could not help but be surprised exclaiming incredible this is the first time I've seen a Ville so dis sheveled Mio ba standing nearby hands on her hips laughed happily haha this is the great point of my master and His companion kakai immediately turned to look at Mio B her eyes sharp well done Son Cat since when did you take the enemy as your master Mio ba panicked flailing her arms and legs trying to explain me it's not you have to listen to my explanation first Mio ba hurriedly explained before that we all misunderstood actually their masters are good people look at them now aren't they risking danger to come here to save you kayaki look confused upon hearing the cat say that really really clearly we am Ed them before Mio ba quickly nodded and replied that's right this is the magnanimity of their masters you walk closer patting Mio baow on the shoulder all right enough flattery for now I'm not as great as this little cat says Mio ba immediately blushed mumbling me Kikai looked at Yu sincerely saying but no matter what I still have to thank you for coming to save me otherwise I really don't know what would have happened Yu raised his hand interrupting no need to be polite but if you truly want to express your gratitude why not tell me he stood up looking at Kai XA and asked what is the longevity tree and that three-headed dragon Naga what is the extremely important thing that cannot be ignored luu Fang stood at the Forefront with Ru and T and Tian supporting from behind he laughed excitedly the boss weapon I got is really so powerful holding it in my hand it feels like a torrent of Force surging out it's so exhilarating Ruan T and tan reminded from behind be careful it seems like a to to but I can only help you with healing so our attack power is not as strong as the opponents Lu Fang charged towards ail reassuring her don't worry if we find ourselves in a difficult situation in this to2 then we can turn the situation into a two V1 he slashed across the head of ail's demon Beast infuriating him ail shouted swinging his weapon towards Lu Fang you killed my Mount you bastard I will kill you Lu Fang parried the attack laughing loudly ha so you finally are willing to take action yourself let's have some fun Just the Two of Us nearby Kaki was caught off guard by Yu's question and exclaimed what you encountered a Naga moreover you managed to escape alive how is this even possible no creature can live and run away from its presence MO bow smugly snorted of course not only did we come away unscathed but we also took down a red dragon in the process upon hearing this Kai XA was astonished why why would you want to do that Yu replied isn't it obvious y Wu explained the confusion if we don't kill it it will kill us so what's wrong with killing it Kai responded I don't mean that Naga is a very rare and precious species even if it is possible to kill it cannot be done so simply she continued to explain the three differently colored dragon heads of Naga represent different attributes the red head represents strength the blue head represents life and the yellow head represents intelligence it has lived for a thousand years on the longevity tree its bloodline and the sacred vein of the ancient tree have merged into one currently the longevity tree has entered a stage of maturity if the blood from the three dragon heads is dripped onto the base of the tree the ancient tree will bear three types of fruits possessing tremendous power kaiah anxiously stated although you have killed the red dragon there is still a chance to make amends while the dragon's blood hasn't dried yet hurry up and collect it this opportunity only comes Once In A Thousand Years upon hearing this Yi Wu and Sh G and Mi ba exchanged glances their expressions darkening seeing their discomfort Kaki asked what's wrong ye W scratched his head hesitantly replied sorry but there isn't a single drop of Dragon Blood left because that dragon head was turned Ash by me the soul scattered completely Kai XI was shocked to hear that she angrily punched him repeatedly on the shoulder furiously saying how could you do that do you know how precious and important that force is you idiot you fool you complete [ __ ] y Wu felt confused um the important thing is that I didn't know before no there was some untrustworthy creature that should have remembered these important things but it forgot what do you think should I punish it to relieve my grudge while speaking he looked at Mio ba causing it to Flinch trembling and saying sorry I truly made a mistake please forgive me master SE G patted guu shoulder forget it my brother since it has come to this there's no need to regret it anymore this boss isn't worth much anyway and I guess the outcome won't be good you really lack that bit of force yiu side for me it might be useless but if taken to the black market or auction it's definitely very rare in short it feels like I missed out on 100 million on the other side ail and LU Fang were fighting fiercely ail's Health was down to 35% while Lu Fang still had 80% Health left Lu Fang brandished his sword towards his opponent saying what's wrong not so tough now are you where did that high and mighty attitude go now that you're on the ground you don't know how to fight anymore evil parried the blow irritably responding despicable what kind of skill is it to fight when you have the advantage if you're so brave then don't let that ugly woman heal you hearing the term ugly Ru and tan Tian got Furious how dare you call me ugly you annoying brat don't think just because you look good you can speak without restraint take care of him for me L Fang ail was equally infuriated unleashing a wild Roar and shouting loudly I'm not in the mood to play with you to focus my minions ail's wild Roar was a skill to summon all demon beasts within a 1 kilm radius immediately a horde of Fierce demon beasts appeared roaring everywhere creating a noisy scene L Fang and Ruan tyan TI cursed can't handle it so you call for backup how Shameless he can actually control so many demon beasts this isn't good seeing the two in a difficult position ail gloatingly said I admit you people from the other world have some skill but this place is my world if I can't defeat you oneon-one then I will overwhelm you with numbers haha you cannot take on the entire world ail shouted before NE finished speaking a loud explosion erupted a sea of fire spread among the demon beasts causing them to Roar and growl everywhere seeing the situation like this ail was shocked we my demon Beast Army he jumped onto the back of a demon beast and fled uttering the words of a defeated man don't get too cocky just wait until I get the blood of the red dragon and obtain the fruit of the ancient trees's power then I will come back and kill all of you haha just wait for me y Wu intended to stop him but see sh G patted his shoulder let him be I wonder if he will cry out loud after he discovers the truth later haha Yu side again we should hurry and follow him I don't want the other two to encounter any mistakes either however the four of them were currently surrounded by a sea of demon beasts luu Fang anxiously said but the number of demon beasts is increasing more and more at this rate it will truly be difficult to escape boss why don't you chase after him first and we will hold back these demon beasts yiu replied no need these demon beasts are not to be feared it's just if we completely Rude the beauty of this place wouldn't it be a Pity as soon as he spoke a blazing golden fire erupted around Yu qex immediately responded you won't feel regret this place is the one I hate the most I hope you can destroy it completely yiu smiled is that so then I won't hold back letun go blazing Crimson flame prison transform the system announced blazing Crimson flame prison transform is a the new skill unlock when your account the cheyen emperor reaches level 10 allowing you to switch to a

Your Dragon used for Dragon type battle pets when used it can transform the battle pet into a mount with customizable size able to carry up to five people y wo exclaimed with delight oh this skill book is quite interesting couldn't be the mount that ail dropped you've achieved the great feet luu Fang luu Fang laughed and replied haha this is also a boss giving me this opportunity y wo activated the skill book and said crimsom Comet didn't you want me to RVE on your back before now I will fulfill your wish crimsom Comet was excited laughing loudly haa y Wu ordered using the expert Dragon taming skill book immediately a red lightning bolt Twisted through the sky striking down and causing crimsom Comet to become huge and extremely Mighty the whole group exclaimed wow sha long has become true truly Majestic SE G who been mounted countless times but had never received a precious item also exclaimed I don't want to be grumpy anymore when can you share some of your luck with me my brother Yu said to everyone all right we must be time efficient let's quickly chase after it we can't afford any more unnecessary losses everyone responded in unison then they climbed onto the mount and ye woo commanded charge ahead Crimson Comet Target the longevity tree at the longevity tree inside Naga was curled up trembling with fear the two heads of the Dragon trembled as they spoke to each other so terrifying is there really such a detestable kind of human in this world the red dragon was burned to ashes not even a little bit of Ash is left blue dragon nervously said that man is too terrifying we are completely not on the same level as him this lir of ours probably won't be discovered by him right Golden Dragon stammered in response sure it probably won't after all we've been hiding so well from outside the cave a voice rang out I know you are hiding here Naga the two dragons jolted realizing it was a Vil's voice along with a group of demon beasts he appeared coldly saying a thousand years have passed and you are still as useless as ever even those Otherworld humans could not deal with you the two dragons looked at him anxious ail you brought so many subordinates what do you want to do abil replied thousands of years I have kindly spared your lives now is the time for you to repay your debt red dragon show your head how embarrassing to hide your head symbolizing your strength like that hurry and offer your blood to me upon hearing the name red dragon the two dragons fell silent their faces paling the atmosphere suddenly became tense the Golden Dragon responded to ail hemp you've come a step too late the Otherworld man turned red dragon to ashes long ago the golden dragon replied even the dragon's blood has been completely burned away not a single drop remains oille hearing this was shocked what how can that be I have waited a thousand years precisely for today and now you say there is none left moreover it's the very power I need most this cannot be I cannot accept this the two dragons roared how can we accept this a mere human easily suppresses us however in the face of absolute power you must accept it whether you like it or not furthermore a thousand years ago you spared us only do your own schemes the blue dragon added his tone full of Glee losing the red drivein was already quite painful for us Brothers but now seeing you suffer because of this we feel quite pleased haha ail furious at their words retorted you bastards you dare to mock me I will castrate you the two dragons not willing to be bullied gathered their strength to prepare for an attack saying you speak with such arrogance a thousand years ago we may not have been a match for you but now we have grown much stronger while we can't defeat that other worldy man handling you is still well within our ability they prepared to unleash two Fireballs but suddenly swallowed them back as if they had seen something that terrified them both Dragons Were drenched in sweat trembling for Before Their Eyes they hurriedly hid deep inside the cave ail seeing that triumphantly thought they were scared off by him and shouted you want to hide ridiculous where did you find the courage to brag like that just now without feeling embarrassed however behind him suddenly sounded a loud bang that made him startle and turn around behind was y wo and his teammates riding the Crimson Comet charging towards him ail swore damn it what is that mount you guys yiu looked down from above smile and said to him you run quite fast I almost couldn't catch up however thanks to you I also have a mount now our positions have completely reversed from before ail Furious yelled you bastard are you mocking me the emerald the dream demon has been with me for a thousand years has merged into one with me I haven't settled the debt with you yet and now you dare to take this opportunity to M me me I will not forgive you you replied calmly oh I didn't expect your character to be built so solidly but no matter how solid you are you're still just a villain in the end you can't escape the fate of being defeated ail shouted in Anger right or wrong Justice or evil those things are fundamentally meaningless only strength and Perfection are Eternal evil continued I possess a perfect life and intellect the True Perfection is merely lacking strength ail snapped in the end you have in fear ruining the plan I've nurtured for a thousand years how infuriating ye who felt somewhat speechless regarding that declaration secretly thinking while I somewhat agree with your bluntness let's set aside whether life is perfect or not that so-called perfect intellect of yours is definitely open to debate ail drove the dagger into the ground emitting brilliant golden Rays saying I cannot deny that you all are very strong right now I truly cannot match your strength but even so I have a way to make you pay a heavy price light surged intermittently around Devil's body Yi Wu assessed the situation and ordered the others don't move Lu Fang let's go stop him Lu Fang immediately responded understood Yi Wu thought to himself at this rate he intends to attack Naga I've already missed one opportunity of power I absolutely cannot let let the remaining two slip away Lu Fang reported the situation no we can't rush in I'm completely blocked by the lightning and shock waves of the air currents how frustrating ye W thought this is not good another situation like this I can't afford to accept any more hatred if not ail will immediately reach level 100 and his area attack will wipe out everyone else ail maliciously said I guess your goal is the last two spheres but even if I die I won't let you seed what I can't have you shouldn't hope to get either haha Kai XI saw this and anxiously said not good he is absorbing the spirit energy of the longevity tree preparing to grow gigantic yigu was surprised wondering grow gigantic why suddenly turned gigantic could it be that his goal is not Nega but the longevity tree itself the ground began to crack and collapse Yu warned this cave is about to collapse Crimson Comet hurry and take them out of here don't worry about us large rocks fell with a rumble Crimson Comet hesitated for a moment and then decided to take the others out of the cave despite their protests what are you doing shom someone shouted y Wu and luu Fang are still inside we can't leave them behind SE G reassured there's no need to worry this little difficulty won't hinder Yu they will definitely find a way to escape once outside it was also the moment when the entrance to the cave was completely buried by Fallen Earth and Stones they panicked it's over the cave entrance is sealed shut how are they going to get out now no sooner had the words left their mouths than a crack appear in the pile of Earth and stones at the cave entrance and a shadow rushed out it was Naga everyone was taken AB indeed in their mouths Naga represented y Wu and luang luang SED no wonder it's a boss it could think of a way to escap like this after the excitement I just feel a bit dizzy from the smell in this mouth Yu laughed and replied haha one head represents life and the other head represents wisdom I bet this is their Enlightenment he and L Fang jumped down and said to the two dragons fortunately you both took the initiative to make the best choice since you have shown your sincerity I agree not to kill you I will help you protect the longevity tree the two dragons responded thank you very much our Master these are things we should do the favor of yours we will definitely repay with all our might Yu replied no rush let's continue this discussion after we deal with ail Kai xed was shocked to overhear their conversation oh my God a three-headed dragon the fierce NAA actually recognizes him as his master this is just too hard to believe in contrast Mio ba excitedly said the master is truly wise and Powerful the admiration I hold for him flows like a river endlessly observing the situation yiu said it's surprising it has escalated to this extent quite impressive ail your life force is very strong in response to Yu's words ail said I have now approached infinite life you won't be able to do anything to me you looked up at the gigantic ail and said is that so I will give it my all to see the super gigantic V angrily retorted all right come and strike me I will stand here without fighting back let's see what you can do to me and that three-headed Naga actually bowing its head to recognize a mere human do you have any dignity as a dragon the nus shouted in reply dignity can dignity be eaten like food is there anything in this world that is more important than life itself the weak seeking protection from the strong is one of the fundamental rules of survival in nature I'm not foolish enough to try to use a Rock to fight an egg hearing such words ail was so Furious that the veins bulged all over his face he said danet are you mocking me don't know your own strength but so what today even if I die or my plans fall apart I absolutely won't let you have your way he gathered his strength into his fist and shouted fiercely I want to see if you can knock me down first or if I can destroy the tree first as long as I destroy the longevity tree you can forget about getting anything haha he swung his fist back to gain momentum but suddenly it was stopped ail yelled ouch it hurts my head hurts suddenly two hands appear in the space one hand grabbed his hair causing him to curse uncontrollably damn it using such a Despicable tactic yiu responded to ail's complaint with a straight punch to his face saying don't be a villain and then report grievances moreover this isn't a fight we just need to use all our strength to deal with the opponent receiving that punch ail spat blood from his mouth his health dropping by 5% after the straight punch a blow to the groan caused him to fall down frustrated ail said how could this happen I clearly have a near infinite lifespan so why can a single punch make me bleed Yu replied I'm quite surprised too a full force punch only took away 5% I must say if there's really that much blood it should require even more effort ail stroll to get up saying you bastard if you have the guts then fight me face to face y wo responded there's an old saying you probably have never heard no matter if it's a straight punch an uppercut or a hook as long as it lands it's a good punch as soon as he finished speaking ail's head was struck by a powerful kick forcing him down again he angrily said damn it then why don't you use a fair fight unable to dodge Yu's punches the kicks rain down on ail's massive body making him Panic wait a moment ail was beaten up by yiu as if he were a child watching this scene yiwu's teammate sighed you have your day too ail truly deserves this after a devastating lesson from y wo ail was left with only 15% of his blood lying flat on the ground crying out why is this happening I am clearly the overlord of this world ye woo of appeared before him like a deity answering his question because the world is truly not as simple as you think in his heart he silently thought before that I had poured all the gifted points gained from consecutive level UPS into the attack aspect the attack power had increased tremendously and even if Avil assimilated the life force of the longevity tree he would still not be able to stop this Force the state that y Wu maintained was balro control A Gifted attack skill balog is the demonic form of the shyen Emperor which can be summoned through continuously using gifted points to unlock the bow Rog summoning entity previously he could use the hands of the B the legs of the B Yu's teammates were all amazed with c g saying bro what other terrifying skills do you have this look is just too cool Ruan Tian tan cheered great God go for it great God go for it Lu Fang said no wonder you're the boss you can't be measured by ordinary standards at all Kai kakai was also very surprised oh my God how can there be men strong like this in the world mioa was extremely proud saying of course a man who can be my master is definitely of a higher level seeing Mio Bow's demeanor Kay xai was also excited so impressive can I also make him my master in STK contrast to the joyous atmosphere aille was filled with hatred at that moment roaring damn it I'm a willing clearly I was just a little away from Breaking Free from the shackles of this world why does destiny taunt me like this why must this man invade my world y wo while completing the fusion responded to him Destiny has never been fair you think Destiny has played tricks on you but in reality everything has long been arranged clearly although you have a sense of self-esteem and a special ability of Awakening the irony is that you were born in a low-level instance like level 40 so the fusion is completed a huge armored punch Came Crashing Down Yu said except defeat facing the immensely powerful punch capable of shaking the heavens and the Earth heading towards him ail remained very defiant no absolutely not my fate is not determined by however before he could finish he was dead an explosion with powerful flashes and sound waves a remnant of the earlier punch was the final image of the battle system notification congratulations host for defeating the hidden boss of the instance system notification unlock the account a man should not encounter this in his lifetime after defeating ail yiu pondered his fate was already predetermined and what about us could this entire planet be transformed into a different dimension this game is not random it is the result of manipulation by some high level existence isn't it if that is true it is truly unsettling the equipment dropped turning into streaks of light in the sky and everyone was amazed Sao G said the light column is really extravagant this is the first time I've seen special equipment drop in such a magnificent way what kind of outrageous equipment will ye woo Noble Essence drop luu Fang said I thought I had missed out on the items dropped by the three-headed dragon but unexpectedly this hidden boss like evil has compensated for that regret Yu landed on the ground and said let the dropped items be after all Humanity in this dungeon is now only us we can pick them up later the most important thing right now is to get those two eggs to avoid a long night of uncertainty with that he turned to ask naet you guys surely know what to do right the two dragon heads answered in unison we know we know the Golden Dragon said please follow me master and esteemed guests NAA LED everyone to the the altar of Life saying it is right here Master before the Magnificent scene everyone couldn't help but exclaim wow this place is truly Splendid ye W wondered is this place built by you all kakai replied no this place has existed long before we were born even after a thousand years there hasn't been any change I don't even know who built it mioa said perhaps evil knows but we can't ask him right now however Yu set the matter aside saying well this is not important Nai continued to move respectfully answering as you command master the two-headed dragon one blue and one yellow bit into its own neck blood flowed out and they went to the position of the pillars causing the blood to rise witnessing the process c g said ha is it that simple I thought it would be much more complicated Naga replied well actually it is not as simple as it seems if it were not for the master no creature would be able to harm us at all let alone draw our blood it is the strength of the master that makes everything appear so simple the small drops of blood fell to the ground causing the Earth to sprout branches that grew very quickly enveloping the column in the altar eventually on the extending branches were two incredibly sparkling fruits everyone was captivated quick look it really is the fruits just look at the grade definitely Legend legendary level Yu saw this and his eyes sparkled with a brilliant golden hue as he thought damn it this is good it's worth the effort even I can sense the extraordinary quality of these two fruits the only thing I'm curious about now is what exactly can these two fruits do and how much can they be sold for Yu turned to kayi as he reached out to pick the sparkling fruit saying let me see what kind of Miracle you really have Yi Wu extended his hand to try and pick one of the fruits but no matter what it wouldn't break free what the hell what's going on I can't get it down even using all my strength Yu wiped his sweat and said this is really strange could it be that the level of this fruit is higher than mine it shouldn't be luang held his sword and said how about I try with this legendary weapon Yu patted Lu Fang's shoulder to stop him don't be Reckless if I can't pick it down it means there is a special mechanism inside kayaki approached behind the two and said these three fruits were originally prepared for me and ail only we can pick them kakat continued even if Outsiders come and destroy these Stone pillars they cannot be taken down moreover if the stone pillars are damaged the egg will completely disappear hearing this Yi Wu turned to Kai X and said so that's how it is then please help me take it down although I don't know your appearance we can consider our ourselves quite familiar now you won't refuse this will you K XA sh asked well if I help you take it down can you promise me one thing Yu asked what is it kakai hesitated um about that you promised me first and then I'll tell you Yu thought to himself with her pure and simple personality she probably won't make any unreasonable demands thinking this Yu replied all right as long as it's something I can do I will agree to it exite lowered her head turning towards the longevity tree a life predetermined you can't deceive me Yu raised an eyebrow and said rest assured I usually don't make promises easily but once I do I will definitely keep it never going back on my word kaixi floated up in a radiant Golden Glow heading towards the longevity tree everyone exclaimed indeed only someone here can activate it Yu looked after kayak's silhouette and said to Mio ba it's not that simple I can censor scattered energy not only does it activate those plants even within my body an unknown active energy is surging forth mioa smiled cheerfully that's only natural kxi is also an ancient being living a thousand years she like evil possesses her own unique traits Yi Wu pondered thoughtfully unique traits huh she probably doesn't even fully understand them herself considering the current situation the preliminary judgment is that the energy is increasing but it definitely isn't just increasing like this we need to ask her in detail about it the longevity tree surrounded them and within the radiant Halo of kexi there was a change the roots are blooming does this mean she intends to continue some kind of ceremony is she finally going to take off her mask M I find myself momentarily at a loss for words to describe this marvelous feeling looking at her perfect face surrounded by warm energy Kai ey removed the animal skull mask her brown hair billowing her already beautiful face became even more captivating enveloped by the surrounding energy Halo everyone couldn't help but exclaim so beautiful wow too beautiful I'm a girl and I'm about to be enchanted by her he said the most important thing is to give people the feeling that they can fall in love at first sight y wo crossed her arms deep in thought while it's true that it is indeed very beautiful it doesn't seem to be exaggerated to that extent could it be that this is also the influence of the growth energy directly affecting our minds she said oh with her beautiful finger she made a small cut on her Palm K asite pricked her finger and the flower blossomed immediately the blood color spread from the two flowers radiating out to each peedle a golden pattern center around Kai XI expanded causing the wilted tree to wither and die descending from the sky to the ground she smiled as she embraced the egg don't worry this is just the final step to complete the ritual because the longevity tree can only bear fruit once in a lifetime therefore the new stone pillar will not be damaged quickly gather them Yi Wu said Thank You system notification congratulations host for acquiring the wisdom egg and the legendary life egg the life egg is a miraculous herb that can extend lifespan in Legend and is also an essential ingredient in crafting Divine Resurrection potions div Divine Resurrection potions can bring the dent back to life without any side effects she continued the Egg of intelligence a miraculous medicinal herb this egg is something that Humanity always wishes to be struck by it is an indispensable medicinal ingredient in the creation of potions God level omissions potions potions of God level omissions after use one's IQ will forever exceed that of others and one will acquire the skill of omniscience the equation for victory has been written in this world there will be no secrets that exist for you heu called out a vis damn it is there really such a powerful potion in existence the Raging Spirit potion at the auction before pales in comparison to these two types of potions it doesn't count for anything at all I Vis hurry up and go assess these two potions with Mosa's ability can they be made I Vis replied happily sure it's been a long time since I've been in action and finally the time has coming come for me to demonstrate my might the potions can certainly be made but there are still two conditions that must be met first the master Alchemist account must be unlocked with that there is no potion that cannot be created second it is essential to obtain the instructions for these two types of potions along with the necessary herbs y w realized a master Alchemist includes both potion making skills and even the god level potions can truly be refined remarkable and as for the guides I'll collect them slowly no rush ye woo thought but on second thought the potential of this Mosi account is really huge and the application of the program is too great I need to quickly open this account KAG tug at Yu's shirt I have fulfilled your request now it's your turn to Grant My Wish Yu said uh what wish are you talking about if I have agreed I won't go back on my word Kai sass blushed well I'll say it I want I want to have a child with you thunder struck in their ears and the Groot froze Yu panicked are you kidding a normal person shouldn't make such an unusual request kexi held Yu's hand I'm not joking I'm serious you are strong and very kind our child would definitely be stronger and Kinder y Wu awkwardly sought an excuse no no no first of all putting aside this unreliable reason just talking about age we are not compatible you are over 1,000 years old I'm only 18 I am still just a kid this Gap is really kayak eyes brimmed with tears I don't want to hear these excuses were all the things you said before just lies how could I trust you like this ye W panicked kick it's not me I didn't Kai kekai sat on the ground crying uncontrollably who you deceiver you deceiver who y wo was sweating don't cry um the group of friends was very happy at their companions pain one of them said this is what we call a flower's fate right brother hang in there hurting a girl's heart means you have to take responsibility you know great god boss doesn't need to say anything else one more for the Haram Yu had a headache looking at his friends these guys hemp Yu placed a hand on kx's shoulder advising kxi listen to me although the act of being born among humans is a primal urge it cannot be taken lightly it must be based on love K asked love what is that Yu said this question is too abstract as a straight guy it's hard for me to explain clearly to you however I can take you out of here and after you see the real world and its Mirad colors when you understand what love is you could once again express your wish to be fulfilled with me after hearing this kaixa felt sweetly coaxed joyfully hugging yiu tightly all right but before that I want to follow you I won't go anywhere Yu's face turned pale replying all right no problem just as long as you don't mention this baby thing again yugu pulled kayak's eye to her feet it's time we should go now let's end this dungeon exploration to see what exactly is good about aille the entire group was in a cave full of red crystals and the sky was adorned with shimmering five pedal glowing flowers everyone was stunned and as they got closer they felt it was truly extravagant I've never seen any falling effect so extravagant like this Yu exclaimed what level is ail exactly SEO G smugly responded good thing I prepared in advance one time someone was Blinded By the Light of equipment falling too close so this time I can't go out without sunglasses ye woo sweet trt how much weird and trivial knowledge do you have in your head information about the appeared items read hidden item drop ether of Life quality level God is an important medicinal material for crafting the magical potion Revival and super good tier Essence potion dimensional symbiosis ye W eyes lit up in just a moment I've collected two types of medicinal materials for crafting the Revival I must get that recipe moreover what is this so-called super good dimensional symbiosis just hearing about it sounds sounds really cool Sao G stared in amazement at the cube containing the equipment that had just dropped from aille God level materials I'm experienced yet I've never heard of such a thing Yu said isn't it clearly stated that it's a special drop item it's just a level 40 Dungeon how could there be such a rare material it's really strange whatever let's see if there's anything else good that drops she added a notification from the system appeared congratulations the owner has completed the dungeon completion rate 90% you have received 100,000 experience points 1 million currency and 30 rare level 40 magic crystals Additionally you have received special items hegemony of concealment sword weapon with the power of avola which can connect with the owner over the years and conceal enormous energy feature cannot use cross-race friendship furthermore a skill book for dragon language after use you can hear the voice of dragons and the favorability of dragons will increase to Friendship a portable dungeon key unlimited usage can open the dungeon and enter at any time but should not be used in combat situations everyone saw their level up notifications Ru and TI and reached level 39 Lu Fang reached level 40 oh how exciting I've leveled up again to think I could level up 20 some times in this trip this feels amazing Lu Fang cheered Ruan tingan tyan laughed loudly but the most exhilarating part was the battle with ail just now right Lu Fang said senior if aille is a special hidden character he must be very powerful right how could I possibly match him it's ridiculous y Wu explained that's because the characteristic of this character is to assimilate the level of resentment of the Target in front of him this means that when he fights you he will have the same level as you SEO G understood so that's why the health points when he fights me and when he fights you are quite similar you can analyze these things in a short time it's impressive Yu expressed his thoughts ail is a type of mutation not to mention that the characteristics of the dropped weapon cannot be used but this skill book if you kill him will increase the favorability with the dragon aren't they part of the same group Kai explained that's not the case the dragons in the forest due to ail's brutality and control ability had no choice but to submit to him therefore you rescued them and brought them Freedom Yu understood Ah that's why I said he is a variant designed unusually moreover from one out of 10 of us we can know that there are nine other unique hidden characters like him which are likely distributed randomly and not according to level this can explain why he appeared in the level 40 Dungeon such bizarre and valuable knowledge Sao G asked his brother what do you plan to do with this godlevel document after all it can't be turned into medicine it would be better to sell it quickly I really want to know how much it is worth Yi Wu replied although I am also very curious I will not sell it its value cannot be measured by money Yu continued there is also one very important thing Mio ba can we exchange the magic crystals from the cave of magic gems as we discussed before Neo bow smile smiled and answered of course of course I will take the owners out now y Wu instructed the dragon magaro nagaro stay here to protect the longevity tree maintaining the ecological balance in this place Dragon nagaro bowed his head to obey its Master's orders while the group followed Mio baow into the cave of magic gems filled with magic crystals indeed there were a lot of magic crystals inside an incredibly magnificent scene Mio bowed cheerfully said of course I will never deceive my master Kai asked in Surprise hey Mio Bal isn't this our Nest why are we here the members of the group were extremely excited this this is an experience area all of these belong to us we are so rich Brothers with so many magic crystals it could be worth hundreds of millions Mio B explained this cave penetrates deep into the Earth along the way there are many types of stones that you call call ancient magic crystals in fact they are crystallizations from the corpses of ancient beasts perhaps this is where the ancient beasts rest which is why so many crystallizations can form here 100 years ago kexa and I accidentally discovered this place and felt the energy they emitted so we decided to settle here Yu held a magic Crystal and joyfully said that means this is an orine for magic crystals although they are only ancient magic crystals of level 40 the quantity is large whether used for leveling up or selling for money it's all good this is what people call a house with ore right the eyes of the team members lit up at the thought of money one person spoke up then what are we waiting for let's start digging with so many magic crystals who knows how long it'll take to dat but even if we Tire ourselves to death I me haha youu suddenly raised a point wait a minute if we rely solely on ourselves to dig the efficiency will be very low I have a more reasonable Arrangement right now with this key in hand I can call a bunch of mining robots to handle it we just need to sit here and wait for the Harvest Yi Wu continued I'll keep five parts fatty will represent the Horizon battle Squad to take three parts Lu Fang and Ruan tyen tyan each get one part does anyone have any objections everyone eagerly agreed boss deep was generous and decisive and everything he did made everyone feel satisfied we were very happy to share a part of it Yi Wu assigned Mio ba a task Mio ba I need you to stay in the dungeon M ba asked ma why is that I also want to go out to explore the outside world meow YW sat down and explained first I need you to help Scout and find out the distribution of various magic crystals around gear I believe that under the influence of the longevity tree other places may also have magic crystals second this is also a punishment for the fact that you forgot an important piece of intelligence before causing me to lose a fruit seed Mi baow looked ejected me it's right for you to do that it's all my fault Yu patted Mio Ba's head however I am a person who is clear about rewards and punishments after you complete this important task I will grant you one wish as a reward upon hearing about the reward Mio ba felt invigorated and cheered up really Master you can rest assured to assign this task to me I won't let a single magic Crystal slip away but I have a small request it doesn't count as a wish the little one Kua is very careless carefree and innocent please take good care of it me Mio ba and Kai XI hubbed each other goodbye Kai said to mioa Mio ba during the time I'm not by your side you must listen to the master and also don't pick up random things on the street to eat Mi bow replied okay you should quickly complete the task that the master assigned to you Yu added don't worry I will definitely take good care of her besides we are not parting forever YW asked AI Vis now that we have passed the dungeon can you check if there are any changes in the compatibility of the constructed base AI viz responded report Master the current compatibility is three and a half Stars an increase of half a star compared to before ye Wu thought that's still not enough I need to find a perfect five-star dungeon standing in front of the teleportation gate everyone exclaimed finally out this dungeon Journey was truly remarkable two people tyen Tian and L Fain excitedly chatted that's right the Senor is really thoughtful before we left he even used the ancient magic Crystal to level up again that's right now we have all reached level 45 Sao G said because level 45 is a relatively safe level whether going into the dungeon or charging Into the Wilderness it won't be a problem at all Yu said cautiously wait something is coming towards us in the distance a convoy was speeding towards them at high speed heading straight for everyone when the vehicle got closer to Yu it suddenly slammed to a halt turning its rear to block the way in front of them yiu was taken back saying what the hell is this it looks really dangerous on on top of the vehicle a figure wielding a gun looked down their voice filled with provocation better late than never you almost got away I can't understand why a bunch of useless trash like you has a bounty from the Hang Jen Corporation he was horu the captain of The Shining mercenaries level 85 he pointed his gun at Sao G and asked is it you you Dan Fatso your level is the highest plus you like to cause trouble the person the Wong J Corporation has a bounty on is youu Right SE sh G panicked exclaiming oh how can this be possible seeing this y Wu added jokingly boss why did you have to provoke someone from the Hang Jen corporation that Sai sh G and Yi Wu exchanged glances Yi Wu signaled silently with his eyes instructing C sh G not to rush to speak but to keep playing along a bit longer to gather more information instantly c g understood the hint thinking to himself that the woman earlier and the captain were both from the Huang Jen group just after leaving the dungeon he encountered another group of people he thought to himself that he was somewhat famous to the point that the Huang Jen group had to send someone to deal with him saoi boldly stepped forward and said loudly boss I am the one you were looking for but is this all the people you have are you underestimating me at least you should have one or two teams right or are the others on their way here his momentum impressed y Wu who secretly marveled this fat guy is pretty good acting like it's real seeing this horu frowned and said fat guy not only are you good at acting but you're also quite clever no wonder wuang Jang has put a high price on capturing you you're right there are still a few teams of five on their way here but this time The Shining mercenaries happen to be the closest to you horm grinned wickedly don't worry before they arrive I will take care of all of you this reward will definitely belong to me and I won't let anyone take it away ha a subordinate rushed over pointing at kayaki and Guan Tian speaking coarsely senior those two girls are top tier Goods killing them would be a Pity better to keep them for the brothers to have some fun the man spoke with such lewdness that even horu had to fall silent shouting damn it are you teaching me how to do my job my eyes aren't blind I don't need your reminders if you want to have fun then it should be me who has the first go saying that he added a kick to the subordinate like Master like servant there was truly nothing left to save the subordinate cried out in pain hurriedly saying yes yes senior I was wrong horm shouted again damn it don't waste time kill them The Shining mercenaries all of them at levels 40 to 44 surge forward charge beautiful ladies I'm coming one man laughed loudly oh so you guys are short on women and have to come fight huh ye woo quickly organized fatty block the squad leader Lu Fang handle the others try to hold on for a few more minutes can we do it l Fang confidently replied don't worry senior leave it to me I just leveled up to 45 perfect timing to use them for practice hearing the response yiu immediately spread his wing move forward to assess the situation and then turned back after finishing his words he immediately flew away leaving the enemies dumbfounded choking on Dust behind one of them looked on and murmured that kid wants to run his rank isn't high but he has some reverse flying gadgets could he be a second generation Rich another one chimed in why are you still Doling let me chase after him he must have quite a few good items on him seeing his soldiers distracted horu shouted in Anger damn it stop worrying about those low-level things focus on killing that fat guy for me while the others haven't arrived yet we must take him down the soldiers immediately regained their focus replying in unison yes senior meanwhile Q shi's group was also ready come on let you guys see how I the fat guy operate at that moment Yu had successfully left the scene he thought to himself that the reward w W Jang had promised him must have just been made public recently otherwise that na wouldn't have initially suggested recruiting him suddenly he noticed the Convoy in the distance there really is reinforcements and they are so close I wasn't wrong looking at this formation could it be that they raised the Bounty because I killed me too W Jang is really exaggerating isn't it just about a female mercenary he thought not true what I did in the dungeon Wong Jang how could he know I wonder there must have been a flaw somewhere in the dungeon never mind this is not the time to think about that he reminded himself even though I'm equivalent to level 100 the five of us facing dozens of enemies is still a bit difficult I need to think of a way to quickly end this battle and return to the battlefield where my four brothers of Yu are fighting orwu was almost going crazy he shouted damn it I'm clearly over 20 levels higher than you yet I can't kill you it's really impressive that you know a bit of foreign language your speech sounds so much better at the same time the sound of weapons clashing rang out mixed with the smug laughter of sash G haha this is where my fat self shines thick skin and tough flesh not so easy to kill Yi Wu landed gracefully casually knocking one soldier away and inquiring about his teammates how's it going can you still hold on Ruan tan tyan clenched her fist and excitedly replied we can hold on I don't know why but I feel my magic power is stronger than before I'm not afraid to face more enemies ye W silently assessed the overwhelming numbers are still able to maintain their blood volume like this it truly aligns with my predictions the key lies in kayex she also possesses a special ability similar to ail this ability is a unique form of enhancement but whether it is active or passive Still Remains unknown suddenly the the sound of breaks Screech and a voice gr out oh you run pretty fast there horu got here earlier than the rest of us did you step on some dog poop luck today or what that you happen to be nearby hormud gave a faint smile and replied the newcomer is Yuan the leader of the mercenary group the rattlesnake on the other side yiga the leader of another mercenary group shouted loudly while lamenting not happy at all so many trashy folks Gathering Together it really stinks here he couldn't help but sneer I guess that stinky smell must be coming from your Matha noticing the tense situation C sh G spoke up to remind them these two mercenary groups are quite notorious in the wilderness with cruel hearts and no intention of forming any alliances this time meeting each other it's highly likely they'll end up fighting ywu pondered the ranks are not low the previous hunch has come true to withdraw intact it seems there's no choice but to use that unlike the silence on Yu's side the group of mercenaries on the side of horu was in chaos resembling a market Oru almost shouted damn it stop meddling get lost that guy is mine yutin calmly replied are you planning to handle this alone that won't do or Mewtwo our bosses have come all this way they can't leave empty-handed unless you want to break the rules yigi standing nearby gently said breaking the rules means facing punishment I advise you to step down otherwise no matter how big your belly is you won't be able to withstand my wrath hearing this horu became Furious pointing at Sao G who was standing there and shouted angrily this is infuriating who would have known that this fat guy would be so hard to fight if I had known I would have dealt with him long ago and you wouldn't even have a chance to get involved vuan laughed heartily haahaha you were still as foolish as ever horu embarrassed and Furious shouted what are you laughing at y zutan quickly clarified you can't even recognize a bounty Target and yet you rushed in haha throw away that signal receiver of yours our people are looking for Yu and that fat guy c g is a relic Hunter I even chatted with his Squad earlier sa shell G cheerfully responded this time does my name make you unable to forget it for a lifetime haha horw confused replied fat guy you are not the person we are looking for being so irritated why are you taking the initiative to step forward wasting my time then he turned to Yu vwu the one named Yu step forward I will tear you into a thousand pieces y Wu did not rush he responded calmly come here come here why are you shouting so loudly I am y woo however before you tear me into a thousand pieces I have a question I wonder how much the Wang Jen group has offered as a bounty to entice such strong mercenary teams like yours to encircle and attack me y Duan responded with a laugh kid pretty brave facing death and still able to care about this fine I will kindly tell you the figure is 50 million honestly I'm also surprised that a kid like you is worth that much upon hearing this yiu expressed his dissatisfaction oh is it only 50 million I thought it would be at least hundreds of millions it seems the Hong Jin group still underestimates me he fainted disappointment shaking his head huin looked at yiwu unable to hide his irritation at level 10 kid still dares to act tough with me do you know you're at death's door he said wait a minute for Mewtwo yuchan proposed after all they can't run away before we kill them let's negotiate how to divide the reward I just want four portions I don't need the rest you each take three portions and we each get a girl how does that sound agreed ye horu also agreed given the circumstances I accept but I want the red-haired girl Yu interrupted excuse me for cutting in before you negotiate how to split my money I would like to boldly inquire about your homes since you are all well known mercenaries and it isn't easy for you to gather together if I don't rob you it would be a real pity you had zoan mocked this joke is too funny did you all hear that he still wants to Rob us I nearly laugh to tears G and horu also couldn't maintain their composure covering their mouths and laughing loudly yiu confidently said then I want to know how you plan to Rob us with this in Yu's hand appeared an item called summoning magic Crystal summoning of the new God a notification immediately appeared summing magic Crystal has been used summoning of the new God ye Wu promptly reminded please members on our side quickly evacuate to avoid unnecessary casualties the sky suddenly became tumultuous thunder and lightning began to appear more frequently the leaders started to panic what's happening why is the sky changing like this amidst the Thunder and howling wind tentacles gradually emerged through a crack in the sky one person shouted quick look something is coming out of the crack from the Fisher a monster revealed itself with countless eyes and tentacles its wide mouth filled with hundreds of sharp teeth it seemed capable of tearing apart the entire group of mercenaries at any moment the crowd began to panic what what kind of monster is this everyone was astonished is it an ancient God is that an ancient god all of them hurriedly knelled and worship the three leaders including hmuu displayed extreme reverence hmuu said God allow me to see your true appearance I would die without regret Yuan shouted loudly please take us to your holy realm Yi continuously whispered Paradise Paradise Paradise the three men seemed Enchanted by the creature that had just appeared their eyes became vacant at this moment c g realized and said to yiu brother I've seen the summoning magic Crystal but what you summon this time feels a bit evil everyone's spirit is being affected Yu was also taken back I'm not sure this is the first time I used it SAA G laughed I don't know whether to praise your bravery or to say you're more Reckless than thoughtful ye who look closely at the ancient god and thought to himself this is definitely an ancient god but standing near it he felt a wave of pressure that left him a bit dizzy though it was merely an illusion at this moment Kay XI suddenly rushed over tightly hugging Yu's arm and feigning weakness it's so scary Master hold me this make Tian Tian who was standing nearby so angry that she turned into a chiy yiu was also confused and quickly said I'm here it's okay but you aren't Me O there's no need to call me master suddenly the Roar of the mercenaries erupted and their souls unexpectedly flew up without any warning signs the situ sitation had become more dangerous than ever leaving no room for little bunny games or master and servant nonsense the three of them immediately formed a team like a sandwich standing strong together ruin T also imitated Kai X tightly hugging Yu's left arm and shouting it's so scary senior hold me on his right side y Wu was also firmly huged by kex it turned out that being a handsome guy wasn't easy at all making y Wu feel distressed it seemed that his own soul was about to be swept away like the mercenaries Souls the three of them saw a powerful column of energy emerging heading straight for the mouth of the ancient god they began to doubt whether these transparent white substances were indeed Souls a notification sounded summoning magic Crystal received special energy boost Soul devouring yiu was secretly astonished a special energy boost this must definitely be Kai xi's ability Kai XI stood next to me an ethereal light emanating from her like a kind of power enhancing mechanism but how this mechanism worked and to what extent it Amplified was still unclear to me I had to find an opportunity to clarify this matter in the sky a terrifying scene unfolded as people anxiously questioned each other is it planning to Soul devour all of us it seemed that the scene signaled the monster's meal was about to end as it slowly retracted its tentacles into the crack SE G standing beside me appeared afraid that if he didn't speak his mouth would be devoured as well he kept exclaiming is it finally coming to an end after watching for a moment longer I felt as if my soul was about to leave my body in a fleeting moment the smoke dissipated and the Whirlwind and thunder disappeared returning the sky to its original state my entire body was now stiff feeling as though I had lost all sensation someone help me yugu honestly replied I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't expect that the summoned magic Crystal would have such a strong effect on the spirit he handed me a pill here take this calming Elixir it will help you recover he looked at those who had just been mocking him now lying on the ground with blank eyes the customer still somewhat aware thought of himself but it can only be said that their lck was not good this was originally just a mental attack but the result was the loss of their souls it seems that this summoning magic Crystal cannot be used when kayaki is present due to its wide attack range combined with a special enhancement which even affects those in the team it's too terrifying the system then announce congratulations you have gained experience 500,000 money 30 million mysterious resources 1,00 T highquality machine repair components 10 30 permanent VIP black cards from the Garden of Eden Club X3 venting dolls a top grade treasure mirror level 60 stable network access device to access the specialized rewards of hang xen Corporation hellish electronic characteristic weapons and musical instruments in Yu's mind Melodies echoed and his fingers naturally danced to the tune you are the most beautiful among all he looked at the pile of rewards and the only word in his mind was disdain on the contrary L Fang C sh G and Ruan tyen tyan were very excited luu Fang exclaimed level up three times Amazing Sai sha G exclaimed Dan do you know how hard it is for us to level up in this Wilderness I've already leveled up several times this time y woo I don't want to keep trying only kayak's ey Stood Still her expression disappointed Yu noticed the unusualness and walked over to ask what's wrong kxi kxi replied softly I'm fine it's just that my level has always been a question mark from the beginning for over 1,000 years no matter how many dangerous beats I've killed my level has never changed always a question mark seeing this ye wo gently comforted her in my world a question mark level represents a mysterious and Incredibly powerful existence so there's no need to be disappointed cheer up our kayaki is really too cute hearing Yu's words kayaki smiled brightly and hugged his arm tightly saying yes master she didn't forget to hold it hand leaving him speechless thinking to himself still so innocent and pure after the fun C sh G seriously talked to Yu hey buddy where did you get that magic Crystal evil summon from that's not a good thing at all if it were someone else even the Summoner themselves would probably be caught up in it y Wu answered honestly to the customer not hiding anything that he had obtained this information from the cult known as cold world King's Landing Club when he had previously conquered the city SE shell G was surprised cold world Kings Landing Club I've heard about that cult in the wilderness there are countless large and small Cults but to develop only this cold world Kings Landing Club has succeeded I don't understand why their followers are extremely numerous not only in the wilderness but also spreading into the inner sanctum of the safe Zone therefore it's not surprising that you encountered them y Wu replied lightly well let's hope they don't proactively provoke me if they do I will use this summoning magic Crystal to show them what the god they worship looks like he then continued this side is fine now we should hurry back I promised others that we would have dinner together tonight if we hesitate any longer it will be too late noticing y W's nonchalant and arrogant attitude CI shell G couldn't help but praise as expected of you just a moment ago you killed dozens of mercenaries and now you want to go home for dinner truly a solid mindset Yu replied I have never been a compassionate or soft-hearted person especially towards those who wish to harm me after all in this era being merciful to enemies is just seeking one's own death haha SE G continued that's right but um I might have to disappoint you the vehicle broke down during the fight and it can't be started right now sorry he after saying that he successfully left all four others speechless for 5 seconds then he continued however we could still use the vehicle from those mercenaries as long as everyone doesn't mind the smell you can't blame me for that right after a moment of astonishment he reassured everyone it's not that complicated let me handle it everyone step back a little he called out a vis start now immediately ad visis replied leave this small matter to a vis the number one assistant of the master saying that I Vis began to perform a series of complex operations showcasing the skills of a master in construction and creative integration C show G exclaimed in panic what is this my vehicle and the others vehicles too what are you planning to do I've this confidently responded don't worry I will bring you a surprise a powerful beam of light flashed and quickly extinguished revealing a magnificent mechanical vehicle everyone was very surprised when the Machinery was perfectly combined with strength and beauty this is the surprise to me what's wrong C sh g i viz asked nothing how is it do you like it I Vis replied next is the presentation about your project named Wasteland Crusher I've this continued the Wasteland Crusher is a heavy off-road vehicle with a wild appearance equipped with heavy Firepower and a super engine capable of carrying a maximum of 15 people the interior is fully furnished and it is powered by batteries mating can no longer control himself sa G rushed over showering the vehicle with affection so exciting this is also used for the Horizon combat team a capacity of 15 people should be enough for now he excitedly said everyone get in the vehicle fasten your seat belts close the doors tightly the fat man I'm about to start the engine everyone had to quickly get themselves organized fat man don't get too excited excited this road is fraught with dangers safety is Paramount reckless driving is not allowed yiu reminded however c g hastily stepped on the gas and sped off leaving yiu behind before he could finish his sends Yu shouted SE sh G is driving away at an unbelievable speed haha don't worry about the details a season driver guarantees that you'll be home for dinner before the sun sets C shell G laughed harly Contin contining to accelerate Yu was now standing alone looking somewhat solitary leading against the railing lost in thought he wondered if this Tranquility was something not too bad but then questioned how long it could last for now he was temporarily shielded by a handm mo group but that did not mean he was entirely safe aside from hang Jang perhaps within the hand Mo itself risks would gradually emerge who had called him in SEO to these high positions like a young lady of the HMO group but that was something to deal with later hang Jang had attacked him multiple times and he couldn't continue to be negligent indefinitely thinking this way Yi Wu immediately ordered AIS this using your Construction Master skills can you hack into hang Jen's specialized website VI replied without hesitation of course Master that's no problem at all hacking is just a trivial matter Yi Wu nodded in satisfaction very good immediately help me infil filtrate the reward page of the Huang Jen Corporation the system began to load various parameters appearing on the screen YW thought he was someone who could not bear to rely on others and the continuous times of being in a passive position made him feel that this time it was time to take the initiative he also wanted to see what the reward page of the Vang Jen Corporation was really like a signal disrupted the system and confirmed the identity of the mercenary horu the system successfully connected and sent a message please wait a moment Yu was disappointed because the noise was too loud and there was a mess of code hormud space access device looked old it was unclear whether he had bought it used or just didn't have the money to upgrade to the latest model it was no surprise that he mistook himself in such a chaotic space looking like this it was hard to distinguish anything Noble with that said he snapped his fingers activating the system and launching his special skill to repair the mass construction learning space everything quickly returned to normal Yi Wu nodded it feels much more comfortable like this immediately afterward the system announce notification mercenary hor meww welcome to the online Center of hangen Corporation four doors have appeared in order mercenary manager team member VIP ye W wondered are the four doors divided by different permissions I'm using hor mutu's access device so I can probably only enter the mercenary room after saying that he approached the door designated for Mercenaries the door slowly opened the system continued to announce notification mercenary hor meww level 85 intermediate permission level credit level high danger please quickly lower the danger credit level to avoid permission being locked instead of worrying you will remain calm hide danger in the danger signal that seems very fitting for that guy the sound of people chatting loudly the scene is set in a bar along with a large announcement screen yiu spoke up is this really a bar it truly fits the style of mercenaries isn't it just a simple Bounty announcement is it really necessary to make it so complicated I Vis replied Master based on the results I scanned it seems that the Huang Jen group wants to ensure the security of their internal data which is why they created such a highlevel independent space that is both Secret and secure otherwise you would have to use the abilities of a master architect even with access devices it would be impossible to enter this space he also agreed that's right an announcement appeared yiu quickly asked is this the Bounty announcement the bounty board includes rank one target is sui true rank unknown danger level five stars Bounty 100 million Yu continued rank two true rank unknown danger level four stars Bounty 50 million he smugly said not bad I actually ranked second on the bounty board they really value me wait a minute so he ranking first is my classmate I met sui earlier in the Treasure Vault of the academy right does she also have a grudge against Wong Jang moreover the Bounty is up to 100 million the previous Master didn't feel anything special about her could it be that she is also hiding her true strength the robot viz seriously analyzed yes it's quite possible according to the law of conservation of energy if a hacker like your master has appeared there will certainly be a probability of another hacker emerging he quickly replied this explanation is very reasonable then he recalled the last meeting with her you want left a very cryptic message if fate allows we will meet again Yu pondered and recalled that saying feeling that indeed had profound implications classmate sui it seems the secrets you hold are no less than mine suddenly a voice rang out well done hor me daring to play with me huh he jumped in Surprise and turned back to see Misha level 93 striding towards him grumbling we agreed on the time and place for the transaction yet you vanished leaving me waiting the whole afternoon and now you have the nerve to show up here if we meet in this Wasteland I will surely fle you alive ywu said suddenly realized something was off or Mewtwo that's right what I'm using right now is po Mewtwo's access device the Avatar that Outsiders see must also be his appearance Yu chuckled awkwardly Transaction what transaction I've been so busy these past two days that I can't quite recall this made her angry what damn it did you forget again you are a pig's head full of dog poop last weekend you asked me to find a bunch of potions for you I was busy for half a day and it wasn't easy to gather enough and now you're telling me you forgot haha do you want me to stab your dog head and smash it so you can remember huh he hurriedly replied wait wait I remember now aren't I doing something big here the value of those potions is so high but this time I will take it all are you satisfied to avoid being discovered he deliberately imitated hork tone molish it was not suspicious at all just surprised Aya is this real I didn't expect you to prosper one day but the potions here with me are top-notch are you sure you have enough money he replied no problem why would I bring you along with my rapidly increasing strength it's just a matter of time here's the deposit upon receiving the notification from the account her eyes lit up is this 1 million 1 million for real the people around began to whisper one person laughed loudly 1 million horu can take out 1 million I will walk over there aha this name has owed his subordinates half a year salary and he still lacks 1 million more at this moment she also lowered her voice and said all right then since you are being so generous I won't ask too much anymore whenever convenient find me to make the transaction Yu replied what about the location saying that she tossed him a piece of paper and instructed I have changed the location the address is on that card you are welcome to come at any time then she gradually disappeared he did not forget to Bid Farewell no problem goodbye on the card was written the address of Area C30 in the wilderness he thought I will wait until I have time to find it according to the map however he did not expect horu to be a mid-level herb Master a subordinate profession that is still very useful AI also investigated and reported to its owner master I have searched for Relevant intelligence and found that this Alchemist profession is ranked among the top three quickest money-making jobs in the past he pondered so that's it it seems I must unlock the title of Master Alchemist youu left that room and considered the bounty board for Mercenaries does not have a very complicated mechanism or functionality and does not yield much if I want to obtain useful intelligence I still need to ascend to higher ranks in his mind he thought horu is a mercenary with authority but his Authority is not enough to enter this VIP room indeed this room had very high requirements he quickly asked Davis is it possible to forcibly open this large door the AI quickly analyzed and replied theoretically it can be done but it is not advisable there is a very high chance that forcibly opening it will destroy the user agreement once destroyed the device user will not be able to enter here again the best way is to find an item with higher authority in one Jang system and then perform a fusion enhancement to safely open the door Yi Wu immediately decided then it's not worth the risk this time I'll come back when I have an item with higher authority he turned back into the system space where crimsom Comet his battle Beast rushed into his Embrace purring y Wu was delighted to reunite with his battle Beast he joked kid I've only left you here for a short time and you already miss me that much I'm sorry though it's too catching to bring a Dragon Battle beast in the city so I had to leave you in the system space right after that the system immediately unlocked the master Alchemist title of mosai a viz expressed excitement ham finally achieving the second title so exciting the system notifications confirmed One Last Time unlocking this title requires spending 300,000 experience points are you sure you want to unlock it he nodded in confirmation telling himself for the sake of my money-making career I'll have to spend more experience points anyway definitely unlocking it most I announce you have unlock the title Apothecary Master the abilities of this title are I've this quickly interjected explaining let me clarify the master since creative Fusion is the core ability of the most sa account now the master can not only use existing recipes to create potions but can also without a recipe freely utilize herbs to fuse and concoct entirely new and unique potions however this action is both Reckless and dangerous the potion created could either be a miraculous Elixir or a world-ending poison and the chances of success are as Slender as a thread he was astonished exclaiming no wonder mosai is capable of inventing anything truly deserving of a label crazy but at this stage we should still honestly follow the recipes I don't want to turn into a deadly poison Master as he walked he thought about his next main task which was to arrange the finances for tomorrow he needed to find saou to ask her to take him around the black market and District date to deal with the issue of the medicine when he got close he stopped in front of the door of the three girls who were sleeping soundly he felt reassured and said they sleep so peacefully good night in the bustling morning of the street Yu looked at the crowd passing by and reflected on the events that had transpired people were quickly returning to a more normal life than he expected after all it had been a a habit for many years the meeting place with young lady saou was reier he sat waiting for her to arrive so they could head to the black market together the sound of advertisements echoed catching his attention according to the news from the government in 2 days the angel realm Superstar young lady suai will come to the city to perform she will use her wonderful singing voice and beautiful dance moves to comfort the hearts of those wounded in the war please look forward to it Y is taken back Li is that the incredibly famous singer g a superstar like that is coming to perform in the safe Zone yiu looked up at the sky deep in thought suai he remembered suai really likes her Yu reminisced about the image of his younger sister the girl not only plastered posters of the singer on her wall but she also loves to sing and dance on her bed even if she is always offbeat suddenly a voice Came From Afar what's up are you Enchanted by the allur of the idol it turned out to be saou yiu was surprised that he also liked following Idols he quickly explained my sister is a fan so I know a bit of information about her anyway let's go saou young lady sorry for bothering you today Yi Wu and saou chatted as they walked saou said this angle realm is only famous in the entertainment and sports circles they're making a lot of money off of it but this time they invited sexule a rising star to perform for charity to raise money for Relief efforts it's quite unusual I wonder if there's some ulterior motive behind it yiu replied there's a saying that the things that don't cost money are the most valuable ordinary people can't see through the business tactics of these big corporations so there's no need to worry or concern ourselves with them saou nodded in agreement that's true as they were walking they came across a door Yu said who would have thought that the ENT to the night market in area 8 is a cafe but why don't we enter through the main door saou responded isn't it a gift from someone the fact that you defeated the world boss is no longer a secret to avoid unnecessary hassle let's go through the back entrance to the room hand Mo rented as they chatted the two arrived at a small Corridor Yu laughed haha thank you SAU young lady you really arranged everything perfectly saou replied to be able to defeat the boss that Yin Juan struggled so hard against you're really impressing me more and more saou then hugged yiu tightly with your skills will you still need your sister in the future y Wu showed a shy reaction to sau's playful words and answered ah well he then decisively responded in a straight man tone of course not we share a deep bond seeing this saou felt somewhat relieved and said you're really something but I can relax now let's hurry inside the two were standing in a magnificent grand hall Yu sigh indeed this is the highest level safe Zone even the night market is much more lavishly decorated saiu replied this is nothing do you know what the night market in the first zone is like saou immediately explained further this is the most luxurious sevenstar hotel located in the city center even I have to make a reservation in advance to get in yu was shocked upon hearing that thinking to himself a sevenstar hotel the lifestyle of the upper class nobility is truly unimaginable for ordinary people yiu thought about the card that mokai had given him wondering if it had enough authority to enter here when he earned some money from his business he definitely wants to take his whole family here to experience the luxury when SAU and yiu arrived at the hotel the staff members standing on both sides of the entrance greeted them warmly saou young lady y woo the rented room has been prepared please come in both stepped into the room looked around once and could not help but admire the Splendor of the seven star hotel so you sat down on the sofa and said previously when you contacted me you mentioned wanting to bring the props and drawings related to the techniques and pharmaceuticals in the black market I stayed up all night to collect and sort out the relevant information Yi Wu replied thank you so much you have helped me a great deal saou yawned broadly and then lay back on the sil s I'm so tired I need to sleep for a while you can take your time to look over things ye Wu smiled no problem you go ahead and sleep I will call you with the evening y Wu turned on the system screen the finished Pharmaceuticals from the master's degree project were extremely scarce and Incredibly expensive compared to the blueprints although the price was not cheap it was still much more reasonable this was because the Master's level profession was one of the highest talents were rare and there was still the possibility of failure during the crafting process leading to increased costs Yi Wu leaned back in his chair pondering I am MOSI an extraordinary inventor who has driven this world crazy failure in crafting that is simply impossible for me I could definitely leverage the price difference between the blueprint and the finished product to reap significant profits Yi Wu laughed haha he looked at the three-dimensional screen of the system with the capital of tens of millions I have I will aim to earn 100 million first the system immediately announced blueprint purchased successfully materials purchased successfully Yi Wu focused on contemplating the system panel there was a great demand for finished Pharmaceuticals and the supply of materials was abundant he decided to attack the pharmaceutical Market first after a while of crafting the system announced pharmaceutical crafting successful after 4 hours of deep sleep saou finally woke up I didn't expect to sleep for so long she turned to ask why wo how are things going for you ye wo happily reported not too bad I've made over 2 billion already saou suddenly woke up completely she immediately looked at the system screen her voice panicked you can't be kidding in just a few hours you've made over 2 billion the trade number 9527 is all yours oh my gosh and there are plenty of trading records for drugs as well all high-end drugs and there are even some super rare potions no wonder you've made so much profit ye Wu sighed upon hearing this it's a Pity that this area no longer has any raw materials otherwise I could have made even more money saou replied of course all the drug raw materials in the black market have been cleaned out by you she leaned against gu Wu her alluring figure pressing closely to him saou ched softly so you want me to help gather 10 raw materials to make money right then shouldn't you reward this money loving person a little by the way shouldn't you explain to me what a master L potion is do you have more secrets hidden from me yiu smiled awkwardly and replied I'm truly sorry sa you young lady I will definitely repay this kindness but this secret I can't share right now however I assure you it won't harm you in the future I will explain it clearly when the time is right Miss IU replied I like you my romantic debt all those specific transactions in the black market are kept secret if one truly wants to investigate they will definitely find out you are the only one selling such a variety of rare drugs which will surely attract the attention of many especially the upper classes in the elite Society a person who can concoct drugs in today's society is indeed a rare existence Yi Wu responded it's fine if I dared to do this then of course I will not fear the troubles that follow suddenly an announcement rang out esteemed guests the scheduled auction for the day is about to begin guests who wish to participate are invited to step into the auction Hall upon hearing this yugu asked an auction saou explained this is a highlight of the black market in zone 8 every day there is an auction for five items that are not available in the exhibition system hearing this Yu excitedly said so there's a chance to encounter rare items that's interesting let's go take a look Miss saou saou replied sure as they reached the auction Hall the system announced esteemed guests please wait a moment the auction will begin shortly saou looked around and said it seems there aren't many people participating moreover the level here isn't as good as the secret auction of Victoria that happened earlier Yu also looked around and said there's no need to hide our identities saou replied that's right after all this is just a regular auction in a safe Zone such a large discrepancy is understandable but sometimes you can still encounter surprises suddenly yiu looked down at the crowd in the hall spotting a familiar figure he felt a sense of surprise so it's Elder Li I didn't expect to see you here you seemed ordinary before but now you've reached level 60 when I was a rookie you took care of me a lot and I am truly grateful I wonder if I will have the chance to repay you today the auction program began the MC opened with an excited voice after four rounds of fierce bidding for the items we will move on to auction the final item the MC then pulled the cloth covering the item aside and said dear esteemed guests please take a good look at this miraculous item this is the premium potion gift from love God I have heard that it can restore Strength for Men after that the MC further explained about this special potion as for the details I won't reiterate but its effects are as powerful as Deadwood seeing spring most men are aware of it especially buy one get one free purchasing the finished potion will come with a premium formula blueprint the starting price is 1 million every man needs it Elder Li immediately offered 1 million suddenly other young people began to discuss Elder lie why wouldn't he be able to get it how old is he now still hoping for an old tree to bloom don't be so loud Elder lie is a highlevel Alchemist I see he is aiming for that formula draft it's true truly a cunning mer Merchant seeing this SAU Chu lightly and said I didn't expect that the last item would turn out to be something useless like this looks like it really is only worth 1 million besides Elder lie I doubt anyone else can afford it suddenly Yu bid 2 million causing a stir throughout the hall sayu was taken aback and quietly asked vwu why are you buying this do you have some unspoken issue if you do I won't judge I will help you seeing she miss understood y Wu hurriedly explained it's not that I don't have oh young lady sa you you might have misunderstood I'm buying this simply a counter Elder lie sa you realized the problem and smiled awkwardly oh oh I remember now I heard the young lady say that the first time she met you you were making a deal with Mr lie Yi Wu smiled and nodded that's right no mistake at that time I was young and inexperienced almost getting swindled by him so this time I happen to have the opportunity to give him some payback Elder lie was very angry shouting a price 5 million Yu wasn't discouraged raising it 10 million at this moment Elder Li seemed to lose his composure looking around the auction for and shouting loudly 20 million damn it which blind fool is causing a scene here if you know what's good for you just pull back your hand for me or don't blame me for being rude everyone looked towards the bidder and began to discuss oh that seems to be young lady SAU from hog group The One beside her could you be a kept man so yet so overwhelmed taking up space haha she might as well come to me my capabilities guarantee she'll have a lot of fun haha the old pervert couldn't hold back making teasing remarks upon seeing a beautiful girl like saou she felt disgusted her face turning unpleasant he was about to rush in to teach the old man a lesson when Yu stopped him it's not appropriate to cause trouble here young lady sa you I'll handle an next man he continued enough with the teasing next is the auction the auctioneer received the signal and announced I will pass the item to Elder lie this buyer has given up the competition 20 million going once 20 million going twice 20 million sold Mr live from bang Jang bid 20 million and received the gift from the love God Yu's purpose in participating in the bidding was to indirectly humiliate Elder lie he was Furious and pointed at Yu threatening kid don't let me see you again if you do that will be your day of death Yu turned to leave but did not forget to express his challenge oh is that so Elder lie drove furiously seething at the annoying figure of ywo he cursed Dan it I'm so pissed off something that should have only cost 1 million ended up costing me1 million because of that damn kid messing things up he ordered his subordinates you all go investigate the background of that guy if he is associated with young lady saou he must be connected to the hanmo group yes Elder Li just as Elder lie was giving orders to his subordinates he saw Yi Wu appear right in front of him y woo sneered no need to go through all that trouble I'll come to your door myself isn't that better we meet again Elder lie perhaps your day of death has come he squinted closely at Yu for a long time before recognizing an acquaintance as he got closer he clearly saw Yu's appearance it's the kid who appeared in the Underground Market in area9 last time that day at the auction this kid intended to take revenge on me he was Furious and ordered his subordinates kill him for me the subordinates immediately aimed their guns at ywu but ywu quick dodged the bullet and teased you didn't recognize me before it turns out your eyes isn't good now that you've noticed it's too late Elder Li's driver yelled damn it I can't see the row ahead the car crashed hard into something sending Elder Li flying out of it he slowly got up clutching his bloody mouth furiously cursing damn it are you crazy daring to provoke me do you know who I am I'm a member of the Hang Jen Corporation before Elder Li could finish his sentence yiu kicked him away once more yiu coldly said you don't need to waste your breath the one attacking you is indeed from the Huang Jen Corporation Elder Li panicked and cried for help ah help me Yu immediately leaped up grabbed his collar and smirked what's wrong surprised excited Elder Li had no choice but to raise his hand and plead for Mercy please hero spare my life at first I tried to spit you and today my grandson wishes to confront you it's all my fault indeed Heroes come from the youth I truly have eyes but failed to see the heavens I hope you can forgive this old skeleton of mine Elder lie was overjoyed when he landed and he immediately know that y was feet Yu looked at him and said I originally intended to kill you but you are fortunate because you still possess something that piques my interest I have heard you are a herb master so you must have many precious medicine formulations and rare herbs right just so happens I am quite interested in medicine and would like to see these rare items Elder live felt like he had found a lifeline and eagerly replied it's easy to talk about I really have stored many formula and precious herbs I didn't expect the hero to not only be skilled but also interested in medicine truly proficient in both civil and Military Affairs impressive however he hesitated it's just that my family keeps those things quite far away and both the car and driver are gone Yu did not hesitate quickly using his wings to lift Elder lie and fly up commanding him to lead the way Elder lie was both happy and frightened exclaiming loudly Hero please fly a little slower my old body cannot withstand this excitement very quickly the two of them arrived at Elder Li's house he led him down to a secret basement the methods of preparation and the medicinal materials that I have kept my whole life are all here Elder lie said not only are there high level prescriptions but there are also many Master Level prescriptions if you are interested feel free to take them Yi Wu observed while walking genuinely fascinated not bad not bad the quantity and quality here truly exceed my expectations seeing Yu engrossed in examining the medicinal materials oblivious to the surveillance cameras in the basement Elder lie thought to himself take whatever you want after all he will have no use for them other than selling for money but his appearance has already been recorded and he will inevitably fall into the Relentless Pursuits of the Hang Jen group everything will eventually return to me haha you who seem to understand Elder lies thoughts completely calmly saying don't look anymore I have already been offered a bounty by hang Jen so I don't really care about a few cameras capturing some handsome photos of me what Elder Li's eyes widened in Surprise suddenly Yi Wu thought of a clever IDE idea he said how about you act as my mole helping me gather information from within the Huang Jen Group after hearing Elder lies request I clearly understood the price of betrayal to the organization he was trembling and kneeling saying then you might as well kill me the fate of a Trader to the company is worse than death I can't do it I smiled and said don't worry I won't let you work for nothing the reward I offer you will absolutely make it impossible for you to refuse here in this although he was still unclear about what I would offer him Elder lie a man who feared death even more as he Grew Older began to waver he asked with a tone that was half suspicious and half curious haha what reward could be more important than life money status women at my age what is there that I haven't seen there's nothing that could make me give up I raised my hand to Signal Elder lie to listen to me continue what if I could help you advance to the master level of apothecary what Elder Li's eyes lit up his face showing clear astonishment he had been stuck at the high level of Apothecary for a long time unable to progress further this had caused him immense pain and despite having purchased many concocted medicines in hopes of reaching the Master Level all had been in vain your words seemed to hit Elder Li's weak spot he bowed his head in shame and said I have indeed been stuck at the high level of Apothecary for over 15 years the thought of advancing to the master level is something I only dare to dream of not to hope for I absolutely cannot joke about this even though I know it may offend you I cannot allow an outsider like you to tarnish the field of medicine that I have devoted my entire life to Y Wu bent down to look at Elder lie to his surprise the old man had a serious demeanor and a forced smile the world is inherently not absolute many things are difficult to explain through common reasoning you would asked for example can you explain how this vial of potion ended up in my hands Elder lie recognized that it was the master intelligence potion after being consumed it would boost intelligence by 30% and could be used continuously without limit in Elder Li's eyes was a glimmer of ambition he wanted to possess the vial of potion seemingly unable to believe his own eyes he stammered this this is the finished product how could this be such a supreme potion is fundamentally not so on the market even I only have the recipe and the medicinal materials seeing elderly's doubtful expression ye Wu chuckled that's right I used a recipe and medicinal materials to create this master intelligence potion if you don't believe it you can throw it away Elder lie trembled as he held the vial his voice full of skepticism impossible absolutely impossible How could a kid like you be a master level Alchemist you must have used some trick to deceive me do you know how rare this file of potion is ywu calmly threw the vial away decisively saying you don't believe it's real then go ahead and throw it away Elder Li quickly leaned forward and reached for the vial of medicine although he said out loud no need his body was very honest making him feel perplexed about himself how could this be this body is reacting as if it can't miss this vile of medicine after a moment Elder lie told himself if that's the case let's try drinking it and we'll know the truth right away as soon as he took a SI he noticed from a professional perspective that the color and Aura of this vial of medicine were indeed genuine which surprised him I have spent 15 years researching and still haven't been able to break through yet a kid in his teens like him is already a master Alchemist this is absolutely impossible as he spoke Elder L drank it all in one go if I'm going to drink then let's drink at all after all it's a matter of life and death the one thing I absolutely Ely cannot let go of is the study of medicine he told himself then remained silent to feel the effects of the medicine but after a while he still hadn't noticed anything unusual and he burst into laughter haha essentially there is no change at all I knew you were just lying as soon as he finished speaking Elder lie suddenly felt a change in his body a pleasant sensation spread throughout him as if he were shedding all burdens he was astonished and murmured oh my this feeling so peaceful and harmonious I've never experienced anything like it he thought sa has become incredibly sharp as if he is about to connect with the universe absorbing the infinite wisdom from the vast Cosmos haha it feels so great the sensation of swimming in this ocean of wisdom is truly wonderful while immersed in the joy of this delightful experience Elder Li suddenly froze as he was pulled back to reality you would asked is the effect of this medicine not bad right he replied with a tone of regret oh why is it already gone moreover I feel that my mental capacity hasn't increased by 30% as expected at most only about 5% Yi Wu smiled and explained of course I controlled the dosage so that your mental capacity would only increase by about 5% how could I let you use up this supreme medicine this is just a trial dose once you agree to help me as an inside man when I help you advance to master you will be able to use the remaining medicinal materials to concoct the medicine yourself hearing this elder lives seem to be completely captivated by Yu's abilities he knelt before him and said master I'm sorry Master this old man was truly foolish daring to judge your capabilities by Common standards your Brilliance is proof of the absurdity of this world idly Jin Shang am willing to devote myself to you no matter if it's money women status or rare medicinal materials and concoctions as long as I can obtain them I will continuously provide them to you my master as long as you help me become a master Alchemist Elder Li said earnestly bowing to someone much younger than himself clearly for him becoming a master was even more important than his own life yiu crossed his arms and looked at him reiterating his requirement these things are easy to say but the key is that you must help me gain power in hang Jen Elder Li immediately bowed his head and replied quickly no problem as long as it's something I know I will tell you everything for things I don't know I will definitely devote myself to researching it for you even if it costs me my old life I will absolutely complete the task you give me Yu gently helped him up and said all right get up now since we have become allies there's no need to be too courteous I have a question theoretically speaking you are not lacking anything at the moment so why are you so stubborn in wanting to become a master Alchemist what is the reason Elder lie lowered his head and explained Master you may not know this but at first I really viewed this as a path to make money however over time and through deeper research I truly became passionate about this discipline a person only puts in their utmost effort when they genuinely enjoy something after many years of hard work I finally became a highlevel Alchemist furthermore within the ruong Jen Corporation my position is still just a certain level no matter how hard I have tried I still cannot break through the final barrier to become a Master Level Alchemist at this point it is no longer about status or wealth it is purely because I want to comprehend the highest realm of an alchemist I once thought that in this lifetime I would have no hope of achieving this but just now you appeared the aspiration I could never attain in my lifetime you managed to achieve at such a young age in my heart you are truly a deity in the field of alchemy perhaps one day you may even break through the limits of the Master Level to reach the realm of the god tier y Wu upon hearing the compliments couldn't help but feel a bit proud he had just learned the art of flattery and also had a good imagination he wondered to himself whether he could reach the god tier level nevertheless he also realized that Elder Li was indeed more stubborn about the art of alchemy than he had expected he quickly instructed then next I need you to do a few things first clarify the internal issues within the Huang Jen group send me the documents related to the operational mechanisms and core Personnel related information second the most important thing is to identify the vulnerabilities risks and potential consequences within the Huang genen group following the Master's instructions the other person immediately responded I will definitely do my best to meet the Master's expectations Elder line nodded in agreement and bid farewell to ywu not forgetting to give him a lot of gifts he thought this elder lie is really inter interesting not only did he give me medicinal materials and prescriptions but before leaving he also gifted me an additional 100 million my total assets have thus reached an astonishing level earning so much money in a single day is something I never dared to imagine before it turns out this is the power of the MOs account however from a certain perspective the various Master Level energies of mosai are also a result of money being poured into it this high-grade medicinal material is indeed very expensive answer without knowing how to make money one could not reach the current level could it be that the hidden account of mostos high is a kind of money printing machine at the Master Level hearing land King Yun say that the paper offerings group has a Construction level Master y w thought tomorrow I should find moii for an introduction and to learn a bit lying down with his head on the pillow Yi Wu felt a bit tired yawned widely I made too many medicines today feeling a bit sleepy well I'll sleep first just as he was getting drowsy preparing to fall asleep something strange suddenly appeared before him leaving y Wu bewildered where is this wasn't I just sleeping could this be my Dreamscape after a moment a red curtain suddenly appeared accompanied by many terrifying images perhaps that is the ancient god Yu was astonished finally you have found me are you the ancient gods why are you looking for me why do I feel feel like you seem familiar the ancient god replied loudly that's right we have been searching for you for a long time we didn't expect you to actively summon us although we do not know the reason how could we let this opportunity from Heaven slip away you will not Escape While y Wu was observing he suddenly found himself tightly Bound by Red strands all over his body the more he struggled the tighter it became rendering him unable to move or Break Free Yu thought to himself the Flames of the Chen Emperor do not seem to work at all is everything merely an illusion or have I truly encountered a terrifying barrier of strength sleep well chosen one they should not exist in this world the ancient god laughed loudly YW seem to be on the verge of being submerged with only his head above the surface his entire body engulfed in the Crimson liquid I'm sorry yiu said you want my life so badly that even ancient gods must line up after saying that Yi Wu laughed hardly slowly Breaking Free from the encirclement of the ancient gods infuriating them one ancient God spoke up it seems that a traitor has emerged Among Us perhaps you found me through him but sorry I am now his master if you want kill me you must first ask him if he agrees the ancient gods discovering the traitor immediately interrogated Lorn why have you betrayed us blood from the bodies of the ancient gods surged filling the sky mingling with the frenzied screens even if you can control Lorn do you think a mere mortal like you can possess the power of a god a flurry of blood lances appeared attacking directly at the traitorous ancient god Lorn Lorn do you wish to oppose us just for this kind of person blood continued to pour out to protect yiu he was extremely confused not knowing what to do if this goes on it won't end well even with the ancient gods light to defend I can't hold on for too long I must quickly escape from this dream but what should I do while trying to find a way out he noticed the strange sound echoing as if signaling to communicate with him do you want to talk to me Lorn what do you want to say to me I do not understand your language The Voice continued to appear and one eye of the ancient god slowly dilated forming a Whirlpool you w wondered why the surface of the water changed like that but Whirlpool grew stronger and pulled him deeper inside he was quickly sucked down into a deep hole what do you want Lorn yiwu shouted desperately suddenly he escaped from the dream jolted awake and screamed loudly E Eh he sighed in relief when he realized it was just a dream he was still safe in his familiar bed looking around the bedroom yiu sighed softly it seems I have returned to reality so what were those things just now a dream or Y Wu was confused still still unclear about what had just happened he noticed a bruise on his wrist a mark indicating that everything that just occurred was not a dream he thought I hold no grudge or animosity against those ancient gods so why are they after me is it just because I interrupted their summoning ritual could it really be that serious Yu pondered the ability of the king the account seems ineffective against this ancient god perhaps my account level is not high enough to inflict any damage on them he secretly thought of the ancient god Lorn who had brought him back to reality maybe it's thanks to this ancient god that I am still alive he looked at the small crack in the magic Crystal clearly it must have blocked the attack from the ancient god for me this magic Crystal needs to be taken better care of ywu self assuredly said to himself he sat down and began logging into the system to check suddenly Crimson Comet ran up and hugged y Wu tightly full of concern he paded shell long Long's head gently and said it seems you were worried about me too I'm sorry yiu quickly checked the system wondering was what happened in my drain recorded anywhere immediately the system notified him a tremendously powerful force intervened earlier causing them to lose contact with the owner during the moment you were asleep therefore the system could not know what transpired during that time ye Wu tried to use the system to assess the power of the ancient gods but it seemed their strength far exceeded as imagination without the assistance of Lorn Yu guessed he might have perished y Wu asked the system about Lorn and information related to the ancient gods the system replied it cannot provide further information as it is an independent entity within this world and cannot disclose anything beyond what relates to the account lock if y Wu wants to obtain answers the system offers two suggestions first unlock the wise scholar account which stores a vast amount of advanced and Rich knowledge second quickly craft the all powerful God level potion which can help solve every puzzle in this world youu felt that both options were impractical what the system suggested sounds like it wouldn't be of any help the all powerful godlevel potion is not easy to acquire and unlocking the wise scholar account requires a significant cost after leaving the system Yi Wu felt a bit anxious though everything seemed quiet he still sensed hidden dangers behind him these ancient gods are completely different not like the information yiu collected from Beast Lords or other organizations the internal information of the hanm mo group is also insufficient to understand the ancient god Yu thought perhaps only the cold world Kings Landing Club can provide truly useful intelligence about the ancient gods as they study this issue more thoroughly than anyone else he wondered if area 8 might be their stronghold he thought even though last time their plot to summon the ancient god was was thwarted by me they will surely come back if the strength of the ancient God continues to grow stronger with each summoning then for me that's a major hassle this Culp cannot be left unchecked even though it doesn't directly involve me thinking until dawn yiu had breakfast feeling quite tired from staying awake all night thinking of countermeasures his father and mother saw their son dazed at the dining table and immediately asked with concern little ye why do you look so tired did you not sleep well last night is there something on your mind ywu forced a smile rubbed his head and replied father mother don't worry I'm fine your son is very strong now and I can handle anything easily suddenly he heard the sound of his younger sister and Kai XI laughing and playfully approaching both greeted brother father mother come look at the outfit I pick for Kai XI Kai xai blushed shil said good morning everyone follow her was Nana yawning repeatedly Yu turned to look and saw kxi in her new outfit looking truly beautiful and Charming which made his heart feel joyful Yu said seeing kayak see all the weariness in my heart suddenly disappeared it's completely healed is this her enhancement ability that's really amazing while he was engrossed in admiring the beauty his sister's voice startled him brother I need to discuss something with you y woot asked what is it yanf said brother let's go together to see the sui live performance with kayak I've secured tickets you w had anticipated that f f would make such a request so V happily replied although I'm not really interested in this kind of thing we told you that you're my precious little sister seeing her brother quickly agree f f couldn't hide her joy and hugged Yu tightly yeah thank you brother Yu glanced over at kexa but hesitated but kexa just arrived I should ask if she wants to come though he really wanted her to join he awkwardly turned away pretending to changeed the subject is Nana going F Fay quickly responded I've already asked Nana she's not going what a Pity Nana waved her hand shaking her head it's okay sister there are still many things to do at home I don't mind not going Nana continued master and the ladies can go and relax it's not just a place for singing dancing or dull and chaotic rap is it what is there to see the entertainment of a low-level civilization is truly pointless the three of them arrived at the Central Square of area 8 Yu appeared with two beautiful women by his side attracting everyone's attention look over there gorgeous women and there are two of them Kai Ken shyly leaned against ye woo there are so many people he turned to ask his sister isn't the regular performance usually held in the evening why is it starting in the afternoon F Fay lightly tapped his hand playfully scolding you are so boring look over there what is that a few lecherous guys whispered among themselves who is this guy that makes me so envious Yu followed the direction fi pointed and suddenly realized that's the entrance to the dungeon fi kept praising that's right but this is artificial a product of angels realm group they are disrupting the entertainment Market this exclusive dungeon can serve thousands of people they have moved the performance inside the dungeon such a smart move who has created this virtual experience escaping reality providing an ultimate sensation in Vision hearing and touch for everyone YW said this advertisement is a bit too much isn't it similar to the secret auction of the Victoria's Secret auction the only difference is that this place can hold tens of thousands of people and the technique is comparable but it's too crowded here we came early otherwise if we came a bit later we would have to line up until it gets dark while Yi Wu was thinking he suddenly saw a familiar figure approaching it was Miss saou saou smiled and greeted V wo didn't you say you weren't interested in these things how come you're here to join the fun Yu nodded in response awkwardly looking at his sister and said well isn't it because my sister dragged me here fay fay quickly bowed and said hello Miss IOU saou replied hello yanf but yiu you are being too honest why are you standing in line here you were the captain of the team under hanmo group you can definitely go through the VIP entrance hearing this Yu smiled with delight thinking to himself H there's such a good thing missu quickly said follow me I'll take you through the VIP entrance I also happened to want to talk a bit with the people from Angel's realm y Wu happily agreed following saou along with FiFi and Kai XI fif said finally they don't have to stand in line anymore fif continued VIP is the best kayak's eye looked at Yuni and excitedly said something that kayak did not understand what is VIP y Wu following the two while attentively observing the surroundings said I'm here because I'm worried about unexpected incidents after all this is a large-scale gathering event however angels real is a big company so they must have experience dealing with conflicts I hope I'm just overthinking suddenly they received a notification from the system teleportation Talisman to the dungeon is in progress all three were captivated by the mesmerizing door fif joyfully exclaimed wow so beautiful I'm a little dazzled here Kai Kai was equally amazed oh is this the dream tour passage leading to that legendary performance so enchanting y Wu stepped closer taking kx's hand it's okay kexi the first time is like that you'll get used to it later unexpectedly kexi pointed and said what is that black hole in the middle so cool I think I understand why this performance is so popular seeing her brother wide-eyed with amazement kayak had chuckled this is just the beginning brother the real highlights are still ahead haha kakai said I'm ecstatic ecstatic as guu was lost in a pleasant feeling he suddenly received a notification on the big screen welcome everyone and fans

aside G is mine g g i love you amidst the crowd going wild for their Idol yiu suddenly thought hey the enthusiasm of the fans exceeds my imagination what is this dinner with the cane of Kudos so embarrassing never mind I'll just sit and listen to the music the fans continued to cheer can everyone hear that it seems like there are many wealthy merchants and Nobles bidding high for the chance to have dinner with suai that's right suai has turned down such commercial activities before so tonight is extremely precious I wonder how high their bids will go Yu listened intently to their chatter feeling somewhat intrigued bidding High seems quite a bargain but do I have to show my face it feels a bit the crowd was excited which made Dead die even more exhilarated finally the MC reassured every everyone you don't need to worry too much about personal information when the main performance starts everyone will receive a data box your true appearance and personal information will be kept confidential upon hearing this yeu sighed in relief so that's how it is but it's a bit of a Pity that everyone won't get to see how handsome I am he joked and continued to chat with everyone the MC shouted loudly the performance is about to begin let's countd down together 3 2 1 as the countdown ended the crowd began to cheer whoa we're about to be sucked into a black hole this is so thrilling Yuni and Kai XI were also caught up in it Yi Wu quickly reached out intending to grab the hands of the two Yan K XI hold my hand oh no I can't catch them our positions have been completely reversed if we bring the data box in there can I smoothly find them but maybe it's not that serious right I'm just overthinking it the stage was dazzling the bright lights forcing the audience to Shield their eyes the melody began to play and Su Lee's voice Rose High Soulful making the chaotic crowds suddenly quiet attentively listening where is the spring day following the swallows back to the Wasteland hoping for flowers to bloom I pick a flower stopping The Whispers of Life about the future the loves of yesterday turn into fragments of memories of your love ahead I welcome the sunlight and smiles gently saying sorry to the Past The Melodies Rose higher and higher the audience swayed and cheered enthusiastically making the atmosphere of the performance even more vibrant on stage the image of the beautiful and captivating Sue lion was so mesmerizing that Yu couldn't take his eyes offer secretly thinking this influence truly exceeds my imagination no wonder she is so beloved YW thought even I am about to become a fan calm down calm down let's return to Earth together the music ends with a stunning flight performance by suai the screen starts to display the number of votes the rankings are out but my position is truly eye-watering someone said squinting looking and checking their ranking D said the exciting performance has begun everyone help Sue L overcome all the obstacles after ded's command a crowd soared up to break through the falling midar youu seem to have understood the scoring rules immediately rushing forward to smash the makur surprising everyone damn is something burning and zooming by moreover it's moving so fast is it a fire meure so strange ywu smirked sorry folks I have to start scoring now if it's a virtual world let's just play on loud explosions echoed as everyone dove into the endless space the players appeared exhausted standing in shock damn it what is this can this guy even slice through planet can he do that too in just a moment Yu had climbed to first place on the leaderboard so cool exi was also very excited about Yu's performance she sent him a kiss in the wind and said this is a reward for the brave Warrior after receiving the support from the goddess the system immediately announced all of Yu's attributes increased by 20% the speed of Point accumulation increases by 30% but only lasts for 5 minutes yiu felt this kiss in the wind is like an invaluable gift especially in this dungeon where it can help him Elevate his own rank as he heard suai sing this planet was once so beautiful but now it is filled with scars I look towards the shooting star gently pre creating an achievement for this place suddenly a flying object approached he realized it is an artificial satellite a crystallization of science something that humans in the old world used to explore the Universe Now it only appears in books since this world became desolate Humanity has only been able to curl up in a shell living merely to survive the dream of exploring the universe has now become a distant reality suddenly Yi Wu felt a strong force pulling him back to the original position pulled down by gravity the engine suddenly burst to life sending him up to the atmosphere this is the dream of countless men in science fiction novels ye W felt the heat from the skin of his abdomen caused by friction with the air even this effect could be generated so cool hexu Li hum the song the light from the twinkling stars travels through thousands of light years to arrive here alone in solitude she still gazes up at the High Sky suddenly a loud explosion echoed nearby but soai continued to sing passionately in the large cage simply waiting for the fate of her past life and her brother in this life suddenly a large demon Beast appeared known as different AAL level 90 Hurry Up This is the final stage boss a chance to earn points someone shouted urging everyone if we defeat this boss we can save shui the leaderboard continuously changed in second place was the character Deadshot ha I finally ranked second Deadshot laughed loudly sniping is my strength when I take down that boss suai will be mine in his Joy he suddenly realized ye W was in first place and facing danger he's that first ranked guy that bastard is going to die if he dies I'll move up to first place haha the system quickly issued a warning signal to Y woo warning warning please return to the cop bit quickly or you will be eliminated and lose your ranking eligibility Yu said it's okay the boss's attack performance is too low like this I want to fight in my own way after all it's just killing someone once more Yu quickly killed the boss in front of everyone's eyes everyone was astonished to see the boss being taken down the boss has been defeated no all my accumulated points are gone Yu stood nearby gently supporting suai and whispering in her ear thank you for your amazing singing I believe that when everyone hears your music they will feel more uplifted she looked at him in confusion and asked who are you the system announced first place gu wo accumulated points are 8,547 1863 everyone was astonished he defeated the boss with just one hit that's unbelievable that's a level 90 World boss could it be that he has surpassed level 90 ah sui I want to hug too Yu smiled and replied I'm just a passer by but after today chances are all be swept up by your fans but have a question do you really exist or are you just a projector suai smiled you're very perceptive but now is not the time to answer that question the show isn't over yet see you later strong brother be sure to catch my final performance after receiving tula's air kiss Yu became confused what was that final performance immediately after he received a notification activated the effect of catching the goddess's eye gaining 500,000 accumulated points the people around him began to curse damn it again is this guy hacking sui's singing rang out the Calamity that brings endless Devastation carries an endless sense of Sorrow everyone Grieves and Falls away but as long as there is Love and Hope the audience continued to shout loudly suai sing on suai raised her voice the sunlight will pierce through the night the sunflowers will Bloom the final live show let's come together the audience shouted in unison great among them was y Wu who was still perplexed why was that teleportation Talisman ID to the stage what is this supposed to mean suai replied this is the final performance a voice from the system echoed welcome to the final solo challenge segment the player with the highest accumulated points will perform here alongside sui the player's performance will directly affect the reconstruction of zone 9 in the dungeon the higher the rank the faster the Reconstruction speed if the ruined area is successfully reconstructed before the end of the performance a great reward will be granted at the same time all players present and the audience watching the live stream will rate your performance with likes or dislikes after hearing the reminder youu scolded why didn't anyone say anything about such an important mechanism earlier the audience grew increasingly angry and someone shouted everyone look at this guy he's no different from a piece of wood damn it isn't this supped to be comedy he couldn't be any more of an insult if he's just a foolish idiot what does he know about music another person chimed in get down don't stand there blocking our view of suai someone else said if you have any sense you should get down now let me go up in your place however if you want to stay go ahead just wait until your dislikes pile up and your accumulated points get deducted I'll be number one haha Shuli looked at ywu and gently reassured him don't pay too much attention to what they say in a bit just follow my movements slowly and I will coordinate and guide you yiu replied thank you for your good intentions those trash comments don't affect me at all don't worry even if it weren't for the prize just for my sister I will not allow this perfect performance to be ruined on my watch hexi ran her fingers through her hair and asked is that so your sister has a good brother I'm very curious what are you planning to do y Wu held a weapon and a musical instrument of the performer and smiled saying like this suddenly he thought of a song even though I don't understand music YF song has been playing in my ear from dawn to dusk it's so familiar that I can sing it when I open my mouth so let's get the party started the audience was astonished by this scene the rhythm of this song is the first hit the biggest hit of the Year this is also sui's de and her most classic song but this energetic remix version has never been heard before it's a completely new style so addictive after hearing this suai was equally excited she thought to herself what a surprise from the beginning until now he has given me so many surprises great let's create a storm together at the school in an instant singlay transformed her appearance and performed alongside y Wu the audience cheered enthusiastically soon lie I love you you are truly beautiful you are the sparkling light the Everlasting belief of my life another person shouted the rhythm of this dude is just too good I can feel the passion boiling all over my body I want to know the true identity of this guy it's amazing how can there be music in this world that stirs the soul like this the like surged dramatically and some people listen to the point of being moved why why is it that this song which I have heard countless times and different versions of brings tears to my eyes this time the rendition of the song strikes deep into my soul really it's just wonderful the ninth area was quickly refurbished outside everyone was amazed I can't believe it just within the duration of a song so many likes were accumulated so hot so outstanding they really pulled it off before the performance ended the area was already renovated that kid is truly incredible the Fe on stage is no different than that of a big star as the performance concluded the cheers continued to ring out Su suai brother thank you both for bringing us such an extraordinary performance the solo machine announced today's performance has ended successfully the profits from this event will be used to rebuild safety area number nine thank you for everyone's participation and support now we will begin the countdown for a one minute teleportation Talisman until next time we we won't meet again suai smiled In Praise J woo this really was an outstanding performance Superstar y Wu humbly replied what superstar compared to you I'm nothing but an ordinary person ywu responded I hope my performance doesn't ruin this spectacular show suai listened and asked what do you mean by a normal person tell me should I believe you yuu replied well it's up to you Sula continued didn't you ask me before is it real now I can answer now I am not truly outside the dungeon but have digitized my Consciousness through special means transforming into who I am now within the dungeon y w was stunned so that's how it is no wonder it's Angel's realm being able to achieve this is really impressive suddenly everyone outside shouted why has the time gone negative is there an error we haven't even started the teleportation talisman management get out and handle it the machine exploded causing the scene to become chaotic ah the system exploded what to do now what exactly happened the manager's Applause rang out along with his words what a wonderful performance having seen such an extraordinary show I believe you all can die Without Regrets right Dez further inquired dear audience are you all prepared to die everyone was surprised to hear what who are you are you trapping us in in the dungeon he walked in without introducing himself and said I am di my name is indeed the phonetic reading of the word death in English this color is truly marvelous isn't it keeping everyone here is simply to ask a small favor I hope that everyone can offer their insignificant lives making a little contribution to the ancient gods of our ancient Lord's Advent Society ye wo shuttered what is the ancient Lord's Advent Society until now although I had never thought there would be a threat I absolutely did not expect that the ancient Lord's Advent society would come to cause trouble his rank is very high but is he enough on his own before he could react a bullet had pierced straight into dice's abdomen accompanied by jering what are you thinking although your rank is 105 we have 10,000 people even excluding those who cannot fight the remaining number is more than enough to crush you someone said that's right and my rank is not low someone Shout Ed die just die you filthy cultist bring your God here I will personally send you to meet your God someone asked speak quickly how can we get out if not take his life another person responded what's the point of wasting words on him killing him and we could naturally go out suai shook her head no it's not that simple relying on him alone can't control a whole dungeon there must still be accomp outside the dungeon controlling everything ye W asked again so even if we kill him we still can't get out suai nodded that's right despite being beaten da still laughed maniacally haha everyone was astonished is this guy crazy about to die but still laughing joyfully damn it da replied am I crazy well I don't know however one thing is certain this world has long gone mad about levels equipment this game world are these normal have you ever thought about it no you haven't you're just a bunch of weak sheep Lambs you've long been tamed by this Mad World this Mad World should have ended the era of chaos must be buried suddenly another dice appeared from the sky causing everyone to panic damn it why did another one suddenly appear dice shouted loudly for the resurrection of the old world send your most sincere blessings haha in the midst of chaos everyone panicked and ran in all directions someone shouted help help is there anyone coming to save us manager kuu Li next to him also fearfully said this isn't good we should hide too if we get caught up in that blood we will also turn into monsters like that Yi Wu immediately refused wait I can't run away I have to find someone to go with me first the system announced activating the eye of positioning observation range expands to cover the dungeon he thought due to the mechanism of the dungeon the positions of me Yun Fe and Kai SII are randomly dispersed I must quickly find them now sua yelled what are you still Doling for at a time like this suddenly a monster charged at them attacking them violently shoai screamed in pain gr gr gr it hurts it's killing me shui I can finally have you Zula fearfully yelled ah Yu coldly said do you want to die I'll Grant your wish rest in peace ji watched y wo annihilate the monster with admiration oh my he's so strong and he's so handsome but his handsomeness is not like that of male Idols who only rely on their faces around them she continued it's the kind of handsomeness that emanates from strong Inner Strength ah what time is it and I'm still thinking about these things what's wrong with me you woo turned asked I have a question if your projection or let's say your Consciousness dies in the dungeon what will happen to your real body in the real world suai replied that would be equivalent to suffering a severe head injury if unlucky you could die immediately even if you're lucky you might end up in a vegetative state after hearing this Yu said then you should stick with me I will protect you if anything happens it would be a great loss for this world moreover my sister would be heartbroken suai agreed thinking to herself men are so manly you would surprised her once again shouting you actually have a dragon mount this is a mount that so many wealthy people want to buy but can't Yu replied that's not important Hold On Tight to me I need to make sure I find my sister and my companions in time Su Lee complied the people below were still terrified running around run away what do you want do there are quite a few Nobles from the upper tiers here do you think you can safely Retreat D laughed and replied poor Rich Noble in my place all lives are equal dietes continued indeed life is filled with Vitality making it the best sacrifice to offer to your ancient gods all of you he created a giant monster everyone screamed in panic demon Beast ah I don't want to die help please spare me I I have a lot of money I'll give you anything you want just please Dace didn't care still laughing run away run away the more terrified and desperate you are the tastier your souls will be that's the flavor the ancient gods cherish the most haha seeing y w and sex we Le fighting hard he said oh it seems there are still people who don't want to accept reality interesting let me teach you a lesson until you accept your fate dice picked up the phone and called hello can you hear me the voice on the other end asked how is the situation over there D replied everything is going smoothly on my end how about you outside in fact it was a dungeon performance controlling all of them the crowd shouted don't move around otherwise you'll end up like the person on the ground Li Fang Z controlled one side laughing encountered a bit of minor resistance but I've handled it all no need to worry on the other end of the line dice asked how's the preparation for the Alchemy formation going Li Fang replied true to the Angel's realm the development of dungeon technology surpasses my expectations as long as we can endure this firewall everything will become more interesting at that point in front of me it will be like a blank sheet of paper though the difficulty lies in controlling the extremes if we can hold out for 20 minutes the dungeon will fully transform into the summoning Alchemy form upon hearing this dice inquired 20 minutes is that enough time for the support team from the Angels realm to arrive what's your plan to deal with it Li Fang Z calmly responded no need to worry everything is under control as long as we can endure these 20 minutes once the transformation process begins it will become Unstoppable moreover I have the authority to mobilize the mechanical stop pile of the Guard Army 50 type2 unmanned combat aircraft from Snap Dragon will be deployed the mission objective is to annihilate all armed forces within the designated radius as the weapons turned to fire people shouted huh aren't those our drones what's going on who gave them the authority to launch what's happening drones are firing at the Convoy requesting support requesting support D laugh jokingly boom bang support the quantity of drones is overwhelming we ah Bang Bang the sounds of gunfire explosions and horrifying screens resonated creating a most melodious Symphony Li Fang Z replied I knew you would act this way I specifically transmitted the sound from the scene to you the sacrifices in this are entrusted to you this time dice said we must definitely make the ancient gods that we favor descend to the Mortal realm y y f rushed to the scene she thought to herself no way there too many people too chaotic all the data shells on our bodies have disappeared finding my brother in such a crowd is really not easy everyone was running in a panic and behind her was a monster thinking I can't blindly search for my brother I must do something to attract attention so that you will come to find me that's right even though the ground is chaotic the sky is still there Yan Fe decided to use the first skill she had mastered shooting fireworks into the sky this is something my brother has seen countless times times as long as he sees it he will definitely know where I am the amphibious alligator saw this and asked what's wrong you still have the mind to shoot fireworks at a time like this are you preparing to Bid Farewell to yourself or are you so scared that you can't even hold your gun steady can't sit still huh shooting here I'll give you three chances if you can Pierce a bit of skin I'll consider myself defeated and spare you from death ganf trembled the level is too low I can't hurt dice at all blind attacks are useless now there's no other way I have to risk it all this is my final resistance I trust you big brother you will definitely pay attention to my signal the amphibious alligator charged toward y yanf shouting you had your chances but you didn't take them just obediently crawl into my belly suddenly a familiar voice echoed from somewhere dare to touch my sister no you should be the one crawling into my belly the amphibious alligator cursed and went to meet its ancestors ywu asked are you okay yanf sard and late y Yun Fe was overjoyed brother it's so great that you finally came to save me my efforts were not in vain yiu reassured her of course I couldn't ignore your signal it was the first skill you learned in the past you often used it to scare off bullies and they would run away Yu thought to himself even though I opened my true eyes and charged straight in Yun Fe facing a formidable enemy and still being able to make calm judgments and actions like this shows how much she has matured in the past all I wanted was to keep my family away from danger as much as possible but in this era dangers lurk everywhere and troubles frequently come knocking at the door therefore I must change my strategy besides building a fortress as a shelter I also must help my family enhance their own capabilities at the very least when when I am not here they can protect themselves yiu said with a determined gaze suai standing beside him happily exclaimed that's wonderful Yu finally the two siblings are reunited Yi yanf was surprised to see her Idols appearance Hau suai brother why are you with Su Lee yiu replied it's a long story and I'll explain it to you later when we have the chance right now the most important thing is before y Wu could finish his sentence his younger sister was so excited that she expressed her feelings outright Li you you really are I'm a huge fan of yours can I get your autograph suai took her hand smiling of course no problem if you're Yu's sister you can have as many autographs as you want y woo feeling ignored shouted loudly hey yanf this is not the time to pursue idols and you too shuai don't spoil her too much Yan fi grinned just a natural reaction suai also laughed what a strict older brother yiu mounted his Mount and said to the two girls all right it's time to set off kixi is still in danger right now we must go save her immediately gun Fe question that's true but brother this Mount is really beautiful when did you unlock it how come I didn't know Yu replied it's a long story the younger sister felt a sense of inferiority my brother has become so impressive the gap between us is getting wider I need to think of a way to catch up to him quickly but y Wu immediately told her yanf there's no need to rush let's focus on overcoming the difficult level in front of us first then we'll think about ranks later your brother has a plan yanf thought my brother can see right through my thoughts y Wu review the situation with concern what's going on kx's coordinates have disappeared could it be that she's in danger suddenly a person appeared holding kexi and asked are you looking for this girl yiu was taken back when did you appear let her go the other person laughed mockingly why be so tense the target I was going to rescue wasn't her at all I thought there was no connection between her and you indeed she has a flavor that's quite different containing very special power no wonder I noticed her at first glance but compared to that the flavor on you is even more to my taste such a sacrifice is truly a Pity that's why I chose not to attack you but rather to keep an eye on you y woo was angry what do you mean by that are you paying attention to me what exactly do you want to say d replied I am showing you a path to survival join the ancient Lord's Advent society that way you and your friend can avoid death I am sure you will be a devoted disciple with great potential y Wu thought to himself this man is very strong how can I deal with him without harming kayaki he tried to appear calm oh so there is such a good thing but I have no beliefs are you sure I have this potential D smiled and answered of course I am sure because you and I are alike we both carry the scent of the ancient gods he questioned the scent of the ancient ient Gods y Wu calmly said the scent of the ancient gods what does the ancient god smell like I can't smell anything don't deceive me I won't get up early for something that doesn't benefit me compared to such ill Usery things I prefer reality for example if I join the Advent Society what specific benefits can I gain dice controlling Kai XI in his hand shouted benefits the greatest benefit is the cleansing of the turmoil in your heart it seems that you have special qualities but your Consciousness has yet to awaken you still need to be transformed ye Wu smiled looked at Dice and thoughted himself using words to provoke him Works adding a little force will make him completely direct his hatred towards me thinking that he placed his hands on his hips looked up and provocatively said I'm sorry but I am a realist I completely distain your beliefs and have no interest in promoting them that seems unrealistic dice shouted angry you bastard dare to disrespect my faith saying that he angrily let go of kaixa and quickly charged at yiu clearly intending to punish him yiu felt delighted as dice rushed towards him knowing my plan has succeeded di clenched his fists channeling strength into his palms and immediately threw a punch towards y Wu you will regret your foolish actions dice yelled the light flashing with his punch Yu quickly dodged and replied I must decline your offer on the other side Yu's Crimson Comet had timely protected Kay XI shielding her from danger Yu looked at his red dragon and praised well done Crimson Comet quickly take kakai away from here dice continued to attack yiu his fists were as hard as Stone constantly striking towards Yu bang seeing that Yu could withstand his blow he was instantly excited and said although I'm not very good at Brute Force the fact that you can resist my level of suppression shows that your physical body has reached quite a sturdy level it seems to me that in order to completely reform you I must act from the aspect of the spirit ye wo questioned spiritual attack he quickly dodged another blow and said then you must be disappointed because my spiritual obsession is even more solid than my physical body dice raised both hands to the sky and from a distance a hole of light immediately appeared Thunderbolts shot out from it causing the sky and the buildings to warp according to the Distortion of space he joyfully shouted then perhaps not in the realm of the spirit I possess absolute Authority in my eyes there is no spiritual defense line that I cannot break Kai saai looked around in astonishment the entire space was shaking and warping Yi Wu held the sword in his hand meticulously reminding himself be careful I feel like something is about to appear from the hole of light a pocket watch shot down bang it swayed in the space causing the buildings to explode everyone stared in shock at the object is that a pocket watch this is too absurd how could he do that one person exclaimed kakai observed the situation frowned and said there must be someone from the outside who has used their authority to modify the dungeon allowing him to control it at will this is not good y yanf exclaimed in Surprise control trol the dungeon at will how is that possible he's not even the game master how can we possibly defeat him Yu's face darkened grinding his teeth and thought even if he is the game master I still have ways to kill him but that doesn't matter the important thing is how everyone can safely escape from this dungeon he continued to tell himself moreover if we kill him we will surely have no way to escape this situation cannot be handled so simply on top of the mountain made from the de dice sat on a throne with an imposing demeanor like a can the pocket watch spun above his head he spoke in a cold and sarcastic tone I was once a very famous psychiatrist having cured countless patients but ironically when my wife encountered a demon beast and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder I was unable to cure her the painful memory of his wife resurfaced in dice's mind he had once seen her jump from a high floor but couldn't save her after she committed suicide in front of me I fell to Despair and blamed myself but over time I realized that it was fundamentally neither my fault nor hers dice with a cold demeanor said the fault lies with this world with this era because they have seeped deep into the bones of everyone the entire world is repeating the same mistakes only the ancient Lord's Advent Society is on the right path D sat high above looking down at the crowd below steadily proclaiming his Grand ideas only when the ancient gods pleased descend upon this filthy world will all sins be redeemed the people below listened intently to him Enchanted dice declared now I impart this Joy this hope to all of you even kayai and Y Yan were captivated by him their eyes glazed as they repeated his words the ancient gods please descend yumu was horrified to see everyone in such a state this is not good everyone is in a state of Mass hypnosis Yi Wu realized everyone now looks at dice with dazed worshipful eyes dice felt intrigued when he saw Yi Wu remain calm in the face of his words oh and you weren't immediately hypnotized by me you truly are not simple he smiled and continued then let me use the strongest hypnosis technique to probe the weakness in your heart as soon as the words left his mouth a hazy circle of light appeared around dice this light continuously emitted causing anyone looking at it to be immediately drawn into it this was mind confusion a type of mental magic that Disturbed the target's mind making their Spirit chaotic depending on the level of the spellcaster the intensity of control and the duration of Maintenance would change yiwu's Spirit began to weaken it's over in the trance he saw images of his parents sister Kai XI and Y yanf all lying motionless on the ground dexs approached y wo joyfully saying finally yielding to me haha to force me to this extent you truly have potential seeing you w kneeling down de raised his hand intending to touch his head confidently saying now is the final step of transformation let me see the weakest point in your inner World suddenly y Wu tightly grasped dice's hand y Wu calmly spoke you want to see the weakest point in my heart I'm sorry it doesn't exist y Wu exuded a scorching heat as if he were engulfed in flames he slowly stood up his voice serious if that's the case it's only because of a lack of money why don't you sponsor me several hundred million the other party looked at ye woen shock stammering this how can this be my level 100 hypnosis skill had no effect on you he gritted his teeth in anger I admit your move is indeed impressive although it was just for a moment it truly made me feel at despare and Chaos Yu quickly threw a punch at his opponent with a thud as if this was Yu's Trump card not easily to be controlled the opponent was hit and spat out blood with his health dropping to 50% Yu thought to himself luckily during the moment of hypnosis thanks to the equipped Treasure Chest otherwise I would have capsized this time the system immediately notified the dragon's ey ring and dragon tooth sword have activated the effect of immunity to spiritual control from this set is now in effect dice feeling as if he were on fire covered in wounds yet still laughed heartily ha impressive indeed you are very powerful I truly did not misjudge you you are more suitable than I thought at this moment dice's Health was only 25% left and his life points were at 30% he knelt down on the ground his body covered in blood but still appeared excited perhaps you are the one chosen by the ancient gods you who looked at died with a cold gaze interrupting the psychop and enough immediately lift the hypnosis and control over everyone unlock the dungeon if not I will make you die a painful and disgraceful death hearing this dice lifted his head laughing uproariously ha compared to the regret and remorse of not witnessing The Descent of the ancient gods Lord larone what is a little pain and death worth haha the pocket watch had stopped the hands almost pointing to 12 dice looked up to the sky spread his arms and reverently exclaimed the moment of dissent is just 1 minute away all of you will become sacrifices for Lord larone dice's Health was only 5% but everyone around still knelt down with him welcoming the de they clasped their hands bowed and prayed long live the ancient gods please grant us relief from our suffering the entire city was being destroyed dice's blood and life force were down to just 1% the mask on his face had vanished dice looked in shock at Yu who was still standing there and said huh what's wrong are you preparing to give up the fight as well or have you finally come to Enlightenment y wo crossed his arms and calmly replied so you're a follower of the big eyed one why didn't you say so earlier if that's the case you should definitely obey my orders D knelt down gasping for breath looking at Yu and said big eye what nonsense are you talking about I completely don't understand yiu smiled cheerfully then continued because I am the master of the ancient gods Lord larone whom you worship to put it simply my subordinates are the ancient gods themselves dice was taken aback struck by this news to the point he felt like he might explode he tremble pointed at ywo and spoke gibberish how dare you spout nonsense and insult the Divine today I will tear you apart Yi Wu watched dice noticing he had truly gone mad stricking wildly and hacking away causing rocks and dust to fall Yi Wu continued to provoke him saying you dare to lay hands on the master of the deity you worship while still claiming to be Pious ye W looked at dice thinking to himself this person has completely lost his mind killing him would be as easy as flipping a hand but it wouldn't bring any benefit on the contrary keeping him alive might be helpful he glanced at everyone behind him they have all been hypnotized now if I summon l cone it probably won't affect them but for safety sake it's better to keep my distance y Wu quickly jumped to another spot dice saw him move and angrily shouted want to run don't struggle anymore his face looked truly mad and terrifying he then charged after Yu dice yelled the dungeon is completely in our hands now unless someone from the outside opens the teleportation Talisman you basically have no chance of escaping come here kill me or let me kill you YW landed on the ground glanced back and smir run the word doesn't temporarily exist in my dictionary he turned back to look at dice provocatively you always claim to be the most loyal believer willing to sacrifice your life for the God but are you sure you really understand your God he continued I bet you don't even mention sacrificing 10,000 people de even if you were to sacrifice everyone in the world you still wouldn't be able to summon larone dice shouted angrily why not Yu replied cheerfully because it only listens to me dice held his head tightly going insane and shouted enough I don't want to hear anymore don't use nonsense to cloud my mind his eyes bulged gritting his teeth as he said no one can deny my devotion no one yiu raised his hand and threw the Talisman up summon command well then open your eyes wide and see clearly that mindless devotion of yours is nothing at all a flash of light gleamed the system notification said using Magic Gem calling of the new God a lav explosion sounded and several thick tentacle-like appendages covered in sharp spikes and the eye of a giant octopus began to emerge from the box D stared in astonishment stuttering F that that is larone it looks like a giant octopus its body is full of thorns and right in the middle is a large eye Yu stood with arms crossed in front of the octopus cly saying so how is it finally seeing the ancient God you've longed for day and night how you feel da trembled knelt down raised his hands to the sky and shouted aha he laughed and cried at the same time tears of warmth swirling around his eyes emotionally screaming my devotion has finally been rewarded the great ancient God larone has finally descended as the first believer to see your true likeness I would die without regret he bowed his head to the ground sincerely worshiping you woo and said you are the new God a being higher than the great ancient gods lone please do not forgive my sins grant me death so that I may descend into hell to endure endless torment a punishment for my offense and disrespect toward you Yu looked at him at that moment speechless thinking to himself I can only say that his understanding is truly profound y Wu declared loudly you are indeed worthy of a thousand deaths however if you can stop the alteration of the dungeon to bring everyone out of here I may spare you from death dtes knocked his head on the ground saying new God forgive me for my ineptitude I cannot do what you require for what we have implanted into the dungeon is a virus that controls the terminal irreversible once activated it cannot be stopped he respectfully raised the control box the way back I leave behind is this teleportation Talisman device but this device can only teleport five people out of the dungeon he said please take those you cherish the most and leave this place creating a new world outside for us at that moment the octopus larome disappeared y Wu held the control box and fur of his brow thinking to himself only the teleportation Talisman for five people am I being told to abandon the others he asked the system AV Vis can this device be linked with the outside control device can it forcibly change the dungeon using the abilities of a master architect the robot quickly replied theoretically yes but the dungeon has 60 seconds left it's uncertain if we can make it in time the countdown clock started from 60 and the sound of Gears was loud and resonant y wo yelled there's no time to hesitate start immediately the robot immediately responded at your command the dungeon began to collapse the hard glass and the towers started to shatter every everyone woke up panicked at the sight before them what is happening we just saw the giant hourglass and then suddenly everything collapsed everyone said quick look at the Battle formation and the countdown in the sky is the dungeon about to change people quickly ran away in panic some went insane shouting loudly run where to run haha we are all trapped in this dungeon there's no way to escape Panic began to spread among the crowd but ye yanf despite her worries still believed in yu we cannot give up hope I believe in him he will definitely find a way to break the spell we must trust him suai standing to the right of yanf nodded in agreement yes I also believe in yu Kai exide hugged y yanf shoulders anxiously saying but can he really turn this dire situation around there's not much time left Li Fang Z standing in the control room stared in ently at the countdown screens the remaining time was 10 he laughed loudly ha it's finally about to begin the screen turned red the clot counting down to 3 seconds he raised both hands and shouted let us welcome The Descent of the ancient gods larone the crowd behind him knelt in reverence collectively chanting welcome The Descent of the ancient gods welcome The Descent of the ancient gods the warning system blared warning warning a powerful stream of data is forcibly deleting the change sequence of the dungeon causing the system to collapse on the screen the countdown clock showed only 1 second left before it stopped Li Fang's ey looked at the clock angrily shouting how could this happen the perfect sequence I designed as being erased his hands quickly typed on the keyboard grinding his teeth as he said I must implant a new change sequence the captain of the Guard team immediately stepped forward to stop him no we must leave here immediately medely the defense outside can no longer hold Li Fang zai refused to leave just one last point I can't give up the captain said nothing more quickly grabbing Lee Fang Z and pulling him out of the room there's no other way let's go Liang Z looked at him pleading wait at least let de be forcibly extracted from the dungeon he clenched his teeth and said time's up our careers must be sacrificed May faith guide his soul to the side of the god Li Fang Z shouted loudly no dice the entire room ship violently the sound of an explosion rang out boom Rumble the robot joyfully announced the countdown has finally stopped we succeeded my master the dungeon is collapsing Yu was moving swiftly with his wings despite his efforts to Halt the collapse of the dungeon it continued unabated and even intensified he thought to himself is the dungeon finally about about to collapse from the outside too the next issue was how to teleport 100,000 people out at once a bold idea flashed in Yu's mind he landed on the ground looked at the group of yean FEI and asked is everyone all right Kai exclaimed V Woo you're back y Yun Fe anxiously spoke up we're fine but so she's about to disappear if this continues she could become a vegetable or Y Wu turned SW who was in a state of freezing but her Consciousness was still clear enough to reassure everyone it's all right yanf this might be my mission thank you y woo for everything you've done I'm glad to have met you but it might be time to say goodbye now suddenly a wave of interference appeared yiu grasped sui's hand and said now is not the time for gratitude or goodbyes the performance is not over yet he looked at Su and affirmed go let us together draw a perfect ending to this performance suai looked at him in astonishment ye woo suai raised her eyes filled with despair perhaps she wanted to give up thinking to herself a perfect ending once the dungeon starts to collapse the entire process cannot be resisted I have no way to stop it the screens around her grew louder fans were shouting and crying Help is anyone coming to save me meanwhile someone was pushing in TR trampling over others shouting loudly let us out I don't want to die suai gradually ran out of strength she wanted to close her eyes and give in for she was the one who understood best what was happening wearily she said the self-imprisonment process of the dungeon has disappeared I can also contact the endpoint outside the dungeon but from beginning to end no one has responded either the communication equipment at the end point is damaged or the people outside have not finished speaking suddenly a warmth from a strange hand grasped hers it was ye woo he looked at her reassuringly don't give up the theme of this show is hope you are the goddess who brings hope to us how can you actively give up hope hexu Li lowered her head sadly and said but now I suddenly feel something like an electric current running through my body she screamed a what is this feeling there is something entering my body he wo held her hand tightly not letting go don't be afraid now I will use you as a medium to transmit Consciousness data outside the dungeon from there I can control the system to open the teleportation Talisman portal suai was a little skeptical is it really possible to do this yiu replied confidently trust me now don't say anything close your eyes calm your mind hold your breath and focus when suai saw her shimmering reflection in Yu's eyes she suddenly felt safe and had absolute trust s line nodded in agreement H then she slowly closed her eyes and followed guo's instructions the crowd cheered looking at each other happily everyone look that is the teleportation Talisman portal great we are saved but the joy was shortlived as they realized that the teleportation Talisman portal was far above the ground the crowd murmured but what should we do to get up there everyone was discussing now she can't do as she pleases like before in the dungeon nor does she have any flying tools what should we do Sue Li tightly embraced the man who had helped her we woo we did it the teleportation Talisman door has really opened all thanks to you suddenly she noticed he seemed exhausted cold sweat dripping from his forehead she worriedly asked V woo what's wrong with you he panted wiping the beads of sweat off his forehead like this it's still far far from enough the teleportation Talisman door with my current level basically can't allow tens of thousands of people to pass through damn I didn't expect that digitizing Consciousness would consume so much of my mental power right now just maintaining conscious awareness is already very taxing the system also seemed quite concerned and spoke up to explain that's because the master previously prevented the dungeon from changing which had consumed more than half of his mental power now the consumption is even more more severe and he must rest immediately before it could finish yiu interrupted no way having come this far I absolutely cannot give up suai held both of Yu's hands up in front of him her eyes full of worry she advised in such desperate circumstances being able to save some people is enough exu announced Le woo don't force yourself anymore if something were to happen to you because of this it would be the greatest harm to us yiu said who Yu also looked at her intending to say something more when he realized his sister was running over to hug him voice filled with self-blame it's true it's my fault I just wanted to go see the performance and cause you trouble being trapped here too Yi Wu lifted his hand to gently stroke his sister's hair speaking softly Yun Fe don't worry it will be okay Kai XI also reached around from behind to hug him sobbing softly it's not easy for me to live a thousand years just to meet you even if this place is the end if I could be with you I wouldn't regret dying he held her hand reassuringly kayaki will be fine suddenly his body began to recover this is my spiritual power recovering right it's Kay's special enhancement ability that I forgot about this Yu hurriedly stood up scratching his head in embarrassment sorry for making everyone worry but there's no need to create a sorrowful atmosphere as if saying farewell if we we want to rescue that not a single person can be missing everyone will escape together seeing him gain strength again kayak said cleverly joked this time I truly went for the final performance yiu reached out to Kai exe zulai and yanay signaling a desire to escape the pursuit of the four individuals the four of them held hands when suddenly a loud Rumble echoed sui felt a strange sensation in her body she immediately described to ywu what what is happening I feel my body filled with power as if I have regained the ability to control everything like before yigu replied that's because I have transferred the control of this dungeon to you let's go Z like before Su Li LED everyone to soar upwards moving towards hope the encouraging gaze of Y Wu and the look of unwavering belief from kixi and Yun further fueled her determination leave it to me suai took the microphone and began to hum a song the poor child though the body is full of wounds believe that the final door of Salvation will open the image of CI soaring in the sky powerful and beautiful filled those trapped below with renewed Faith everyone listened intently to her some shouted look it's suai she's still singing she hasn't given up I'm flying up Am I Dreaming we're saved we are finally saved ye W smiled that then turned to Yuni and kexi let's go together back home hexu Li was still lost in The Melodies her wings spreading out as she soared into the Galaxy a place filled with passionate love warm Embraces and the hope that everyone had successfully escaped through the teleportation Talisman they danced joyfully huging each other saying I I am still alive we survived we did that was dangerous we almost died in there suddenly a loud explosion rang out oh no the teleportation Talisman has exploded this power we cannot let our guard down this is the final moment they looked up and realized in front of them was a wall of fire blocking all paths standing before the wall of fire was y wo the top ranked one he saved us suai realized but how is it that now he is so powerful dice searched around I don't see the live f z group anywhere they must have taken advantage of the chaos to escape ahead so I should just as I was about to run away ye Wu spotted me he shouted stop the master has not yet spoken do you want to leave without saying goodbye da quickly knelt down and said please spare me my Lord please forgive my momentary blindness to seek life is Instinct but as long as you command I am ready to offer my life for you at any moment Yu stood in front of him her voice serious you truly must pay for all your actions but right now I cannot let you die so easily because you still hold value for me the soldiers quickly rushed forward grabbed him and shouted Target detected immediately capture him do not let him Escape dice felt that only Yu could keep him alive so he desperately flattered her a lowly person like me can let my master exploit me it is truly in honor ha I have no regrets in this life haha looking at him like that yiu thought to herself what a hopeless matter man but in order to obtain information about the ancient Lord's Advent Society I still have to keep him around while lost in thought she suddenly heard a voice calling vwoo we finally meet in reality Su Li appeared weak she needed the support of the worried woman beside her your body hasn't recovered yet don't force yourself the woman advised trying to help suai move closer to yiwu who called out suai as soon as yiwu finished speaking suai inadvertently bumped into a stone and fell forward fortunately yiu quickly caught her be careful he gently hugged her in his arms when he saw her faint due to her body still not having recovered yiu was worried She fainted the girl accompanying her shook her head both anxious and blameful these two girls are truly too impulsive their Spirits have suffered quite a bit they need treatment immediately but SEI insists on meeting him she told me everything that happened see Li said you are the Great Hero Of This Disaster thank you for everything you have done I and Angels realm ow you a favor you can turn this favor into a reward if you wish if you can wait 2 days from now when the event calms down I will contact you the people from Angels realm hurriedly took zul Li away leaving y Wu a bit worried and regretful she looked after them and said this matter is not urgent you still need to ensure the treatment time for Li Yi Wu walks the plan slowly Fly Away reluctant but also relieved the final danger has passed but it really is not completely over the defenses of a large corporation like Angel's realm are not easily undermined by those in the ancient Lord's Advent Society unless there are internal issues I hope Ki does not get caught up in this deep in thought Yu suddenly heard a cheerful call of his name langu it's so good that you and the others are safe missu Yi Wu turned around and saw her hurriedly running towards him she quickly hugged him tightly distressed as she said before this after I brought you all in something happened so I had to leave I never expected such a big incident would happen I was very worried about you you woo flustered did not dare to respond at sau's Embrace there's no need to worry I'm fine everything has been resolved smoothly saou gradually pulled back facing y wo yes I know with you around any problem can be solved although it might be a bit out of context there's something urgent I need to tell you right now Yu was surprised H what is it SAU slowly pulled out something shaped like a small gem sparkling brightly an important mission that was originally scheduled for next week has been moved up to the day after tomorrow all the battle teams under the corporation with a rank of level 10 and above must participate but unexpectedly your king combat team has also been included in the combat list you wo appeared worried and quickly asked is this large Gathering of multiple battle teams meant to prepare for a large- scale Expedition moreover my te was formed not long ago and we are only at level one why were we included in this Expedition saou nodded and replied you are not mistaken this is a large-scale Siege Dungeon battle targeting the stronghold of a certain race the final point of the mission clearly states this as for why you were included I won't elaborate but someone is intelligent as you should be able to draw your own conclusions easily Yu took the gem from saou and quickly provided his answer there's no need to analyze it's clear from the context that there is no good intention behind this there must be some ulterior motive however seeing saou was staring intently at him yiu suddenly remembered I have heard about largescale Siege dungeon battles this is a special type of dungeon that is significantly larger than a regular dungeon not only a monster stronger but the area of the dungeon is also broader contain many boxes that need to be defeated and secured ye Wu continued explaining this kind of dungeon often requires 20 to 40 people and there are even super large dungeons that need up to 100 people if it requires hm's group to be fully mobilized then the scale and difficulty of this dungeon must be considerable of course the rewards obtained will also be very valuable ye wo felt I really have to thanks some kind person for adding me to this operation so I don't miss out on this precious opportunity when Yu was thinking about the plan SAU couldn't wait any longer turned her back and said to him all right I have something urgent to take care of I'm leaving now yiu smiled and bowed thank you miss saou Will you participate in this dungeon Expedition saou replied I will participate but not go into the dungeon I will take on the role of logistics Commander mainly responsible for preparing the necessary resources for this Mission I will be in the rear cheering for you see you later the two said goodbye to each other at the same time Yuni and Kai XI excitedly approached y Wu and happily said brother I heard I want to go too me too I can help you YW shook his head you two were not members of the combat team how can you go moreover the difficulty of this mission is very high and dangerous Yun Faith full of Hope stepped forward and gently shook Yu's arm pleading you were the captain of the combat team adding us to the team wouldn't that work the greater the danger the more I need to experience combat to improve my strength I don't want to spend my whole life hiding behind you and holding you back Yi Wu remains silent looking into Yan fe's eyes as if he was thinking about something and nungi Yi is not wrong this world is always is full of dangers and there is no escaping it one must strengthen oneself and change previous ways of thinking he looked at his younger sister who had grown much more mature and was now able to face difficulties on her own this made yiu feel emotional as he affectionately ruffled her hair and said if that's the case as long as you agree to one condition I will let you join the team and go into the dungeon together yanf looked at her brother her eyes sparkling with curiosity what condition you wo smiled and replied in these two days I will provide you with a certain amount of ancient magic gems as long as you manage to level up to 40 I will agree to let you join yanf felt that this requirement was almost impossible she questioned leveling up over 20 levels in 2 days how can that be done moreover where will you get so many ancient magic gems Yi Wu smiled confidently this small matter is up to your brother your brother is a man with o War yanf innocently looked at him and asked what does war mean kakachi smiled and hugged Yan's waist saying I know I will tell Fay f after that the two women chatted and laughed as they headed home together Yu was still engrossed in studying the differences between ancient magic gems and regular magic crystals ancient magic gems contain a large amount of transmutable magical energy which can provide a significant amount of experience points instantly upon absorption the efficiency of this experienced conversion depends on the physical condition and potential of the user those with innate Talent can easily achieve a convergent rate over 70% while some no matter how hard they try only reach 40% or even less moreover this process consumes a lot of mental energy and physical strength to the point that an ordinary person can only convert a maximum of 10 mfu of Yun Fe I am very much looking forward to the conversion results of the girl I hope it will be remarkable one day however I completely trust in her potential and am looking forward to surprising outcomes While y Wu was busy with his research he heard Mio Ba's voice Master they have arrived I have followed your instructions and gathered all the magic crystals here he patted its head praising well done keep it up at that moment the three-headed dragon appeared its voice filled with grievance you little cat don't even think about taking all the credit there are many hidden or mines that I discovered if it weren't for my abilities gathering this many magic crystals in just a few days would have been nearly impossible the two people continuously argued back and forth and Y Wu had to step into mediate all right all right thanks to both of you the Naga wasn't bad so let's do this I allow you to make a request of me as long as I can do it I will definitely fulfill it the three-headed dragon quickly refused no no master you could spare my life that is the greatest Grace already how could I dare to dream of anything else y Wu nodded good awareness keep this request for later you might need it in the future that settles this matter Yi Wu continued to research before this I use the skills of a master architect to create a batch of robots for testing here now the performance is quite stable however it still feels like this level lacks a little bit of excitement y Wu return to apartment number eight carrying a lot of magic crystals Yun fate jumped up in Joy so many ancient magic gems it turns out my brother really has War their mother spoke up y woo while this floor is high putting such precious items out in the open is really too extravagant there's a saying that money never goes out y Wu was a bit hesitant the problem is that these valuable things we directly convert them into experience points is it possible that it's too wasteful he wo reassured his parents you don't need to worry too much I have plenty of level 40 magic crystals and besides upgrading your levels is more important than money at least when I'm not around you can have the ability to protect yourselves looking over yiu saw that yanf had also started to focus on converting experience points he reminded mom and dad you should start too Nana you can use it as well hearing their son's explanation Yu's parents felt much prouder and more at ease all right we'll give it a try Nan happily replied yes master an hour later Yu's parents leaned against each other panting from exhaustion his mother complained ywo I can't take it anymore I need to rest for a bit at our age our physical strength and mental stamina just can't keep up y Wu smiled affectionately you two take a break first we'll stop for today as for Yan everything seemed to be going very smooth smothly her level began to rise she joyfully exclaimed look I did I told you I would definitely be able to her level had increased to level 45 parents looked at her with pride oh Yuni is really excellent Yu also looked at his sister secretly praising her you managed to level up to 45 in just 1 hour yum fe's Talent is indeed extraordinary the conversion rate is at least 80% then he turned to ponder what about Nana I wonder how her conversion process is going curious he glanced over and saw Nana working hard to convert quickly and in a Flash she reached level 60 I want more I want more you would asked Nana what's wrong are you okay seeing Yu staring at her Nana was startled and hurried to hide her greed ah I'm fine Master look nana has leveled up a lot too can Nana go with you to the dungeon seeing Nana's leveling speed y woo fell a great sense of pride in the same amount of time Nana has reached level 60 the conversion rate is absolutely 100% no wonder she is the perfect robot I created youu thought for a moment and said going to the dungeon should not be a problem this is a great opportunity for everyone to gain combat experience all right Yuni Kiki Nana and the three of you will be members of the fighting team accompanying me to The Dungeon Siege this time B heard the announcement and IM immediately rejoiced jumping up and responding in unison all right mother y Wu immediately lowered her voice seriously advising you must pay attention to safety you must listen to your older brother's commands Nana seemed to secretly reveal the true face of a traitor meticulously calculating at this point agreeing so easily I must take this opportunity during this war to deal with you in the dungeon suan said let's consider other matters finished and next we will use the task assigned by by Miss taou to learn about the dungeon he began to issue orders to the system authenticate the system responded starting authentication please wait a moment King combat Team level one team leader Yu authentication complete simulation Mission deployed information appeared on the screen about the large scale Siege dungeon lost Celestial Temple recommended level 40 130 participation limit restricted to 100 people you must complete related tasks beforehand to be permitted entry Yu wondered levels from 40 to 130 why is the level Gap so large it's a bit strange the system began to answer Yu's question the entrance to the dungeon also known as The Lost Celestial Temple was randomly discovered in a secret cave beneath the desolate hoing th Plateau the Explorer of orb magic crystals discovered it first and sold the location of the dungeon at a high price to a Corporation the corporation's Pioneer team Then followed a tunnel for about 2 km and discovered the large door of the dungeon the system announced after several weeks of fierce battles with the elite demon Beast guarding the door they completely wiped it out and finally completed the mission to open the dungeon due to the high danger level of the dungeon the corporation decided to First send cloak drones in to Scout and gather basic intelligence the system reported according to the information received the area of the dungeon is approximately 50 square km the demon beasts in the area range from level 40 to 130 and the quantity of magic crystals is abundant the dungeon has a total of 35 bosses when the Drone approached the temple it was shot down by the guards outside the only information recorded before the Drone was shot down was about the first boss Shasta the guardian of the temple at level 115 due to the uniqueness of this dungeon it is necessary to prepare a mindset for a long battle the first mission of this dungeon is to build a main resource base located far from the Race's place and rich in minerals to prevent disruptions in Supply during prolonged combat after completing this Mission information about the second mission will be updated ywo while pressing on the system screen pondered this dungeon is more dangerous than I imagined was it a wise decision to let them come along if someone deliberately targets us the situation will become even more complicated looking at the registration list Yu realized that his team was the one with the lowest rank he frowned are they trying to make us a Target what should we do if we end up under attack and become the subject of ridicule Yu wanted to check with the system to better understand his suspicions he asked excuse me what is the specific duty of the king team in this battle the system quickly responded the specific mission of the team has not yet been announced you must wait until entering the dungeon to auto automatically received the related tasks yiu felt dissatisfied with the system's response but he reminded himself to adapt to the situation no matter who was behind this and what intentions they had toward him yiu decided not to waste this wonderful opportunity he had a hunch that his skills in architecture would play a crucial role in this dungeon Conquest tomorrow he would look for some architectural blueprints time to sleep time to sleep he told himself trying to lull himself into slumber suddenly just as he was dozing off his phone rang with a new message Ting you have a contact request from a stranger hearing the notification sound yeu startled awake who is this strange contact it's midnight and are they advertising something these scamers are truly professional he muttered after some hesitation he finally decided to pick up the phone on the other end a familiar voice rang out that of a woman is this y wo it's me she said he was taken a back and asked who are you the girl arranged to meet y Wu at safe Zone 8 in the Central Park feeling excited he arrived on time sitting alone on a part bench he looked around and realized he was the only lonely one amidst couples on dates feeling shy ywu pulled up his collar to cover his face but he hadn't expected her to invite him out especially to a place like this suddenly a girl named mior Ru level eight approached y wo with a smile that made him feel flustered a multi multitude of fantasies flashed through his mind is she taking the initiative to befriend me oh no being too handsome is a burden the girl lowered her head and moved closer to Yu so what is this did you want to kiss me right away after just me Yu thought to himself and chuckled then inadvertently blushed in embarrassment the girl unaware of his thoughts gently asked my pet dog got lost nearby have you seen it yiwu was taken ab and replied a pet dog I'm sorry I haven't seen it since I just got here what does your dog look like I'll help you keep an eye out he felt a bit shy thinking it was just a casual exchange but to his surprise the girl was very enthusiastic really thank you so much it's a small dog brown fur yellow eyes named how how upon hearing this yiu was delighted and exclaimed are you Yin Hanan this disguise is so good that even I didn't recognize you Yin Hanan quickly sat down moved closer to yiu and signaled him to speak quietly sh don't speak so loudly even though it's nighttime we should be more careful with disguises after all my identity is a bit sensitive yiu quickly stood up giving up his seat to the girl she turned to face him speaking in a whisper to avoid drawing attention from those around I truly have to compliment you your disguise is absolutely brilliant even your personal information has changed completely fooling me the two stood waiting until late at night and only after there was no one left passing by they sit next to Yin Hanan and begin talking seriously meeting me out here in the middle of the night is there something important you want to discuss I was just getting ready to sleep y wo opened the conversation Yin wuan looked around cautiously and then whispered it's about the dungeon mission in 2 days you know about it right do you notice anything unusual your king team is a newly formed first class Squad yet it has been assigned to a dungeon mission where the lowest teams are at level 10 yo curious asked rapidly really spiritual resonance I was doubtful and then you came to clarify this for me so what is the reason Yin H calmly replied that's because a high ranking leader is paying attention to you they want to use this operation to probit your true background hearing Yin Hulan say this Yi Wu had already made a sure guess in his heart if the target is me then the one paying attention to me is probably the young Master of the mo family Yin muan nodded in confirmation to think you could guess this far you really are very smart she said M Kai young Master is the chairman of hanm group the first hair of the chairman the second hair is his sister m n the competition for control of the group between them has long ceased to be a secret despite the disparity in their capabilities Moki has still garnered significant support due to her reputation and friendly image which she has built among the lower classes moreover there are quite a few people in the board of directors who wish to use Moki n to balance the power of mokai therefore mokai Master always sees mokii as his biggest rival previously during the different AAL event he sabotaged mim's plans coupled with the fact that he was introduced into the group by m n this has made Moi see him as a thorn in his side and want to take this opportunity to eliminate him Yi Wu understood everything Yin huan said but he still wondered why she was sharing this with him he asked so won't you have to face attacks from higher level teams that's really more risk than reward isn't it Yin huan was silent for a moment bowed her head and continued you understand the seriousness of the situation yet can still smile truly you are impressive but not everything is beyond Redemption she said with my understanding of the young master he won't take action directly from the start so I have some advice for you Yin huan said seriously you should obediently pretend to be a useless person making the young Master feel that you are of no value and pose no threat be humble in every situation avoid standing out so that he has no reason to act against you y Wu listen feeling a bit touched by Yin Juan's concern but he understood that things wouldn't be as simple as she said he replied thank you for your advice although I don't know much about M I'm sure that whether I act humble or ostentatious his desire to kill me won't change with my personality I will definitely choose the latter pretending to be humble like a dog doesn't suit me why not leave him astonished instead Yu look directly into Yin Juan's eyes and asked further but why are you saying these things to me we are in the same Corporation but essentially on two opposing sides isn't your action a betrayal of your young Master Yin Juan slight blushed and turned her face away because you are a rare talent I don't want you to get caught up in this meaningless Clan Civil War losing your freedom and even your life it would be such a waste of a genius like you right now you could still choose your own path unlike me who has never had the opportunity to choose from the beginning to the end surprised by Yin guan's answer y w wondered why she was not chosen why can't a powerful figure like the young Master controlled his own destiny y Wu asked Yin Juan's face briefly showed sadness and two streams of Tears slowly rolled down carrying hidden pain she recalled her unhappy past starting from when she was 7 years old and began to tell y woo a powerful figure who is born a powerful figure yinhuan spoke bitterly seals and shackles were implanted in me from a young age and now they can no longer be removed yiu sat down and listened not taking her eyes off her I was born in the slums of the Wasteland my parents after going out to find food never returned every day I could only eat what I found in the trash not knowing if I would die by the roadside any day Yin huan sighed her voice filled with deep pain she said in the Wasteland people die every day and no one cares about the life or death of an inconspicuous girl like me one day when there was nothing left to eat I bravely decided to go out in search of Fortune unexpectedly I encountered a merchant Caravan being attacked by bandits in that group there was a boy dressed very well although he looked younger than me when faced with danger he did not panic at all on the contrary he calmly commanded everyone to fight even using his weak magic to distract the enemy she said but then I discovered a few robbers sneaking around the back intending to Ambush him at that moment he looked so brave decisively ordering everyone to hold firm absolutely not to waver this is a very valuble asset of the company we cannot let it fall into the hands of others when I saw he was about to be attacked I don't know why I suddenly found an unexpected strength and speed immediately rushing over and pushing him out of danger you must have guessed it that young Master is moai from that moment the Wilderness lost an anonymous girl while hanm Mo group gained a new member named yidan meeting the young master was the biggest turning point in my life thanks to him I escaped from a life of hardship no no longer worrying about food and clothing the young Master even provided me with money nurtured and trained me helping me become a key member of his combat team my life has been marked by the young Master making it impossible for me to break free from the whirlpool of the handm struggle I am fully aware of this but from the bottom of my heart I admire you you woo because you possess Freedom so please don't let yourself get caught up in this cycle of struggle okay more importantly I truly don't want to be in opposition to you hearing yinan recount her life Yi Wu felt a slight Sympathy for the circumstances of the small but strong girl it was unexpected that Yin H had such a past her words made sense but Yi Wu at this moment was not able to achieve the kind of true Freedom she spoke of only when a crucial stronghold was successfully established could it perhaps be fully realized the two were engrossed in conversation without knowing that their entire discussion had been overheard by Juan how who had a level of 125 Juan how said ha that's too much little sister ginban your background has always been a secret you have never mentioned it to the comrades you spend time with like us yet you open up to this kid with an unknown background I am truly heartbroken haha Yin Hulan was startled when she realized their conversation had been EES dropped on she angrily asked Juan how why are you here were you following me y woo standing beside her was also observing not taking his eyes off Juan Hal level 125 huh the oppressive Aura emanating from you is indeed quite extraordinary Juan how chuckled replying following don't put it in a harsh way like that I just happened to discover you disguise going out I was simply worried for your safety which is why I followed a small girl like you out alone at midnight what if you run into bad people ha ye W suddenly felt very idle I should be the one worrying more he thought to himself I feel you should be more concerned for the safety of that bad person suddenly Juan how walked straight towards ywu patted his shoulder and smiled with a meaningful expression I didn't expect to meet yiu he said the person who everyone is talking about in the Legends an honor and honor yiu replied with a smile well I don't dare to accept it I don't dare to accept it may I ask who this person is Yin muan looked at y wo and introduced this guy is Juan Hal the strategist behind the captain of the Mong team usually he cares a lot about me but I didn't expect him to be a stalker Juan how annoyed explained I said it's not stalking it's really a misunderstanding y Wu cheerfully introduced himself so it's boss Juan an honor to meet you I've heard that everyone in the Mong team is Elite selected from a thousand especially a second strategist like you meeting you today is even better than the rumors Juan Hal shyly replied I don't dare to accept compliments from ywu I can't compare to Super Li just that Dart like you perhaps you don't know but right now the entire Corporation is discussing about you y Wu suddenly said talking about me a nameless person like me still cannot bear this Fame just as they were having fun Juan's face suddenly changed his eyes were filled with killing Intent no longer any humility a person who could snatch the booth from Yin hon could not be considered a nobody as soon as he finished speaking he lunged to attack Yu Juan how what do you want do Yin muan anxiously urged the two to stop in contrast yiu seemed very interested in this duel so it turns out to be hand-to-hand combat Yu commented but the power Behind these skills seems a bit light while fighting Juan how laughed and reminded this is a battle between men little sister Yin Juan don't get involved ignoring her warnings the two continued their fight or rather the exchange of techniques between two men speed is too fast y w challenge you're not wrong but if it's a battle between Men Please senior give it your all don't hold back anymore although he was somewhat restrained Juan how was both angry and impressed with Y woo previously I was worried about killing you so I really didn't dare to use my full strength but at least I have used 60% of my power this kiddo Yi Wu began to genuinely apply force in his attack causing Juan how to be astonished the strength is incredible truly interesting this kiddo's level is at least 110 I shouldn't have underestimated him before he thought I want to get serious now this brat has caused sister Yin hon so much trouble and even got her punished by the organization if I don't help her take this kid down I definitely won't sleep well tonight hearing about Yin Juan being punished y Wu asked anxiously wait a minute what do you mean by being punished by the organization Juan shouted that's because you stole boss and disrupted her Mission Yin horn has been suspended from the team Juan Hal stop talking Yin hu tried to intervene but failed Juan how continued even demanding that she invite him to join the Mong team otherwise a greater punishment would await y woo who Having learned the truth was confused about how to handle the situation she never mentioned anything about recruitment before only advised you to withdraw from the internal conflict I didn't expect that this seemingly cold exterior concealed such a kind heart Yu turned to look at Yin Juan and saw her looking sad I'm sorry I didn't expect things to turn out like this afraid that he might feel tormented she quickly comforted him you don't need to blame yourself at that time our relationship was just just competitive the boss was someone you gained based on your strength and I truly respect that moreover this matter is already very complicated and I hope you don't get too deep into it y w insisted no after all this is because of me and I will definitely take responsibility don't worry I will use this dungeon mission to find a way to help you regain your position hearing this Juan how also showed satisfaction with yiwu's sense of responsibility not bad not bad knowing that you are so responsible I can rest easy now let's go Juan how said goodbye and turn to leave see you in the dungeon mission 2 Days Later Yi Wu happily replied got it bossan at this moment Yin horn approached and reminded him I have great faith in your abilities but absolutely don't do anything Reckless this dungeon mission is at a very high difficulty level and moreover our captain will be leading the team you absolutely must not provoke him Yu took Yin Ban's hand and affirmed I will keep it within limits and won't act recklessly just wait for the good news from me Yin huan smiled happily and nodded in agreement meanwhile y Wu along with Yun fi and kayaki was busy preparing for the upcoming dungeon Mission I think although my sisters Rank and the kai EXA group have increased their equipment is not that good therefore upgrade trading equipment in the Black Market has become the top priority after all that time I earned quite a bit of money but I completely underestimated these girls spending abilities in less than an afternoon they spent all 30 million of mine even though I feel a bit regretful about the money when I see the three people in front of me so radiant and happy I grit my teeth and encourage them my sister's voice rang out in a sport manner it's amazing big brother my equipment is even newer Kai excitedly showed off her new purchases her eyes sparkling I feel happy too Nana was no less enthusiastic master master what about me do you like the style I chose Nana smiled sweetly her expression adorable in my mind I kept thinking about that 30 million and wondering what on Earth did they buy can it be that it's not beautiful I told myself 30 million after all never mind my purpose of earning money is to make them stronger right and as for the Master Level blueprint that I need I might try to see if M has it a Master Level blueprint in the black market is indeed very rare not because I'm short on money I console myself with this thought very quickly after that he called M and receive the response Master Level construction drawings I will send them to you in a bit money is not needed I'm not lacking a little cash on the contrary I want to apologize to you this time you were arranged into the dungeon entirely because of me someone as smart as you must have guessed this is M scheme I originally wanted to stop it but I couldn't succeed Yu appeared relaxed no problem don't worry about it to be honest it's just a good opportunity for our team to solidify our footing hearing his confidence Moi felt more at ease moreover you're not fighting alone in the team participating in the dungeon this time onethird is from my faction at that time you can look after each other of course everything must be done with caution you must return safely Yu replied assuredly okay I understand mokai encouraged guwu then quickly hung up and sent him a message the system notified that M had gifted him 30 Master Level construction drawings upon receiving the news Yu was extremely delighted asking for one but receiving 30 instead these 30 drawings must be worth at least more than one 100 million Mo young lady is really generous it makes one more and more excited tomorrow is the first day the king team officially sets off outside the safe Zone the number of people waiting made y Wu exclaim so many people yanf also chimed in moreover everyone's levels are really high thankfully I leveled up before coming here otherwise it would be too embarrassing deep H confidently padded her shoulder just relax yanf you'll get used to this scene after seeing it a lot around them people were Whispering about their team some murmured hey look at that team over there that's the legendary King team with the name y woo so many girls following them another person scoffed yeah just a first tier team what's there to show off about Lu Fang unfazed by the gossip stroked his chin and Bo to himself if I can meet the Mong team later maybe I can get their autograph no I'm a member of the king team now I can't lose my spirit like that Ruan tantan was equally excited eily saying is the stumming beauty Yin Juan from the rumors here too I'd really want to see her true appearance seeing everyone so excited y Wu broke out in a sweat worriedly thinking should I tell them about my connection to the Mong team or not in that atmosphere suddenly a loud voice cut in huh how did a chicken team mix in here do you really think this is a territory for a Sy scene tour Yuni and kexa noticed that it was the grey H how combat team at level 60 LED by ran Chong ran Chong looked openly disdainful who allowed a level one team like this to come in here with such poor quality you don't even have the right to be a bullet Shield just a waste several of his subordinates chimed in and yet they dare to call themselves a king team how boring aha but the girls are the opposite their quality is quite High hi interested in coming to hang out with me Lu Fang hearing this became Furious and shouted a bunch of dogs looking down on others y wo held him back don't get worked up we just arrived there's no need to fight over this argument ranan continued with his insults I've heard about you people from M since you're low levels I don't know what kind of luck you stepped in to snatch the boss from yinan I thought you were some great character but turns out you're just a kiddo if you've latched onto a wealthy woman just accept being a kept man and stop rushing here to seek death behind bran sham a person appeared Wan ho grabbed his head and said get out don't block the way ran xong was shocked exclaiming when he realized this person was a major figure he and his team hurriedly fled running while saying sorry sorry blocking Wan House's way really sorry it's our fault for not seeing please forgive us how hugged Yu's shoulder and greeted well we meet again Yu so how is it ready to fight a big battle Yu replied hello boss Juan however the only team that can fight a big battle is your Mong team I should just obediently complete the assigned Mission seeing the two of them so close ranong secretly thought what this kid is an acquaintance of Mimi and is also so familiar with Wan how of Mong what's going on here juanell joked obediently I really doubt that but since we've mentioned our team let me introduce you y Wu awkwardly replied um okay he thought to himself onean how seems a bit insightful even though we've only met once he has already seen through me it must be just a coincidence right Juan how introduced each member of his team to Yu the person walking towards us is our team leader ji Wang Chuan Mong should not be mentioned as the one with the highest combat power in the handm mo group of course just slightly better than me GW Chun remains silent upon hearing this Juan how continued introducing the team members this is like Singh a member of the iron steel team and this is Dan Lou a healing Mage both of them are quiet and don't like to talk much then he pointed to Leia and song yancha these are assassin leya and Mage schwarzman song yancha I'm sure you've met them before since Yin horn has been suspended I've temporarily moved him from the reserve team to join us son yanel expressed his discomfort saying Juan how you really don't need to introduce so much to an noody he doesn't deserve it leya interjected so you are y wo you don't seem impressive at all what kind of work is that girl Yin onean doing G1 Chun ignored the two of them acting as if they didn't exist which left the them astonished suddenly Wallen Hal exclaimed Captain y wo is blocking the way say something captain please stop he extended his hand in a gesture to shake and said the incident with Yin Hanan was due to my recklessness I hope we can have a chance to cooperate in the future so I can make up for this mistake J Wang Chun looked at the hand extended in front of him remaining silent and motionless the members of The Grey how combat team stood around waiting to see the spectacle chatting excitedly does this kid want befriend G Wang Chuan has he taken the wrong medicine moal not killing him on the spot is already showing respect for moi nigh this time there's definitely going to be a show to watch one of them scoffed however contrary to their expectations ji wangchu and eventually shook hands with Y Wu and said well I hope your performance this time doesn't disappoint me and mokai yuu replied I no one member of the grey how combat team could hardly believe his eyes mouth a gape in shock am I seeing things G Wang Chuan actually shook hands with that kid normally he wouldn't even glance at us this must be an illusion G Wang Chuan decisively ordered let's go the Mong team majestically turned and walked away Juan how cheerfully looked back and said to ywu do your best ywo don't forget Yin Juan's part two yiu smiled and replied I know in its heart he pondered the moment of their handshake wondering did g Wang Chuan see through my true intentions this G Wang Chuan is truly not simple I hope the system on me doesn't get discovered by him suddenly someone approached from behind and said to Y woo are your words just now in Earnest y woo do you really want to collaborate with the Mong team Yu asked back huh who are you the person who had just arrived introduced himself I am Lu changfang the captain of the storm battle team Miss Mo has instructed me to take care of you but your recent Behavior has raised doubts about whether you are really one of us he continued his voice Stern if you betray Miss Mo it may be hard for you to survive the dungeon hearing that threat yiu fell silent and did not retort further he thought no way could it be that my recent Behavior displeased the M 19 I merely intended to give Mom a way out for yinan forget it let them think what they want I will still follow my own way of thinking the conversation ended just as the dungeon was about to open Li ji the top construction master of hammok group was in charge of this the subordinate next to him reported sir the power charging for the teleportation gate is complete and the dungeon can be activated at any time lii leaned on his staff and loudly commanded activate the subordinate replied yes the teleportation door has been opened aoud boom code and a gap appeared on the door accompanied by Sparks of lightning everyone gasped in awe wow it truly lives up to the reputation of the master Craftsman of hog group the teleportation door of the dungeon usually takes a week to charge yet he completed it in just one day the efficiency is truly astounding one person from the crowd stepped forward excitedly saying Master can you help me Forge a piece of equipment I am willing to use all my savings ignoring the surrounding commotion the master said seriously start seeing his imposing demeanor yiu secretly admired him this old man is indeed impressive y Wu thought unlike me he achieved the Master Level through real ability and true skill however this person's personality seems to be quite unapproachable upon reaching the main base of handm the chaotic scene struck them Rubble was piled high and dried blood was smeared everywhere as if a fierce battle had just occurred everyone was stunned what is going on here one person spoke up wasn't it said that a new base would be built this would supposed to be an existing base but why has it been destroyed like this and what about the dried blood what happened here kayak HEI tightly held onto Yu's arm anxiously saying the smell of blood is is too strong surely a very tragic battle occurred here before yiu firmly replied don't worry I'm here he thought to himself analyzing the current situation it seems that there was once a Vanguard team stationed here but they were brutally slaughtered the higher ups seem to be hiding a secret that cannot be revealed to others it appears that this mission is not as simple as described the systems voice rang out clearly explaining the mission of the level one king team and the level 40 gry how combat team the mission of both teams is to protect the mining machine number 38 of the D7 mining area the amount of magic Crystal that the machine extracts will be converted into accumulated points for the combat team and it is mandatory to ensure the machine safety preventing magical beasts from causing destruction looking at the mission YW thought protecting the magic Crystal mining area makes sense to rebuild the base a large amount of magic crystal is needed as energy but this mining machine is too old and mourn out just a glance reveals that it has gone through a great War without any repairs and its level is still so low in front of them was an old T800 type magic Crystal mining machine level 40 rumbling loudly as it operated showcasing its aged lifespan yanf spoke up oh it's so noisy it feels like it could collapse at any moment ran xong frustrated kicked the machine's wheel and cursed damn it why do I have to be root with you guys what a stroke of bad luck he continued the most important thing is to handle this pile of low-grade scrap metal the team's accumulated points have dropped again Yan navely asked what are team accumulated points what is their purpose ran xong became even more frustrated upon hearing this you guys really know nothing and dare to enter the dungeon to prevent your chicken team from dragging me down I have to explain this clearly to you you can think of Team accumulated points Point as the experience points of the team the more accumulated points there are the higher the team's level will continuously rise they can also be used at the resource Hall of the corporation to exchange for the supplies you want such as Weaponry medicine medicinal materials professional blueprints everything is here he paused for a moment and then continued of course the higher the teens's level the higher the resources that can be exchanged for it therefore team accumulated points are our lifeblood I dream of having them because they are completely insufficient after that ran xang angrily pointed at the old machine in front of him and continued event and this pile of scrap metal basically can't last long even if it can it can only mine low-level magic crystals of level 40 the points that can be converted are extremely few tell me am I not angry ye woo upon hearing this stroked his chin and said so that's how it is the key to this mission is mining this is something something I'm very good at so there won't be any major issues ranong was about to stop him and said what are you doing are you really going to mine the magic Crystal by yourself don't be foolish doing it this way will be very inefficient however when he saw y Wu swing his sword and slice through a nearby magic Crystal ranong was stunned you can actually cut through a level 90 magic Crystal ran xang asked further what exactly do you want do Yu replied don't rush you'll find out soon he secretly commanded AV Vis merge this mining machine with the level 90 magic Crystal along with the mining robot I created earlier I want to turn it into a perfect ore extraction weapon I Vis responded Yes master the master construction integration skill was activated Lu Fang seeing this laughed excitedly haha we're about to witness the boss's Fusion technique again in contrast ran xang didn't understand at all merely repeating Lu Fang's words integration skills what is that once the merging process was completed the old machine transformed into a level 90 rampaging siki the mining robot went into a frenzy zeroing in on the ore leaving no war behind in its path the grey how combat team was shocked and puzzled when they saw the newly crafted machine they couldn't help but wonder what is this where did it come from one member remarked this is construction skills I didn't expect this kiddo to know construction skills and moreover to be able to create a level 9 Mech this astonished everyone they understood that this was definitely a special skill Yu pointed at the machine and assigned work to Nana Nana this mechanical device belongs to you first use it to find level 30 ore and it needs to be enlarged quantities Nana replied yes my master after that she nimbly sound the machine and exclaimed as expected of my master this thing truly has quality nanao was filled with excitement inside thinking this time it's my sincere opinion Nana activated the locator scanned the area and discovered the target just as requested she quickly reported master I have detected a level 90 magic Crystal vein with super llarge reserves located 5 m right beneath us Yi Wu was surprised so there are such large Reserves I guess the previous level 40 mining machine couldn't extract them which is why the vein is still abundant like this indeed Miss Fortune there is Fortune yiu commanded Nana go ahead Nana responded and began to operate she thought the drill bit is a symbol of power the gigantic drill bit spun wildly piercing into the ground making everyone exclaim in awe Kai XA was horrified and fell to the ground Yuni approached helped her up and asked with concern sister K xie are you okay is everything all right Kai replied I'm fine just startled by this crazy machine moreover I feel Mana before kxi could finish her sentence Ruan Ty and Tian Drew everyone's attention elsewhere everyone look below there are really so many magic crystals and they are level 90 we're going to get rich this time we will definitely earn a lot of accumulation points for the combat team the crazy machine was mining level 90 magic Crystal veins Nana's expression gradually became Twisted revealing a frenzy Desire with each drill's Rhythm she mumbled not enough not enough I still want more the accumulation points of the combat team were increasing at an astonishing rate showing no signs of stopping causing the gry how combat team to shout in amazement senior look our accumulation points are skyrocketing it's truly unbelievable he he is this hacking another member reacted level 90 veins require level 90 detection equipment and this equipment can only be produced by a master in engineering how could this kid have do it ran xong was silent for a moment then turned and slap the one who just spoke scolding at this point what are you still fussing about anyone with eyes can see that this Kido is definitely not simple he said no he is a master a discreet master the other guy took a slap to the face tears welling up saying sorry boss ranom who previously looked down on Yo with arrogance now grumbled bent down and flattered um brother yay he we had eyes but couldn't see the mountains and rivers if there was anything offensive just now I hope you won't hold it against us Yu didn't take it to heart and replied it's fine I've seen a lot we are all a team as long as no one targets me the accumulated points are part of yours too ran Chong smiled thank you at invisible Optical the main base the operations monitoring room where the overall situation in the dungeon is observed is currently in chaos what is this King team they were at the bottom of the rankings before how did they suddenly climb to first place first they stole the boss from Yin Guan and now they've gained so many level 90 magic crystals in an instant this isn't something Ordinary People can do this kit definitely has Secrets but through the drone camera sweep no cheating Behavior has been detected on him Li GSI the master observed the situation and thought to them so he was actually able to transform a wornout level 40 mining machine into a level 90 intelligent mining match this kit not only understands but is also very skilled in the field of engineering alov his apparent level is only 10 his true level must be at least 90 otherwise he wouldn't be able to create create a level 90 match but what is his true engineering level high level or Yu astutely glanced towards the camera causing everyone in the observation room to be astonished he actually detected our drone that was cloaked with Optical camouflage how is this possible the Drone didn't not function at all Li Jessi ordered immediately recall the surveillance drone from the D7 mine sta questioned why Master lii interrupted don't ask just do as I say subordinates only need to follow orders yes liai continued to ponder internally this drone is a high-grade engineering weapon I created if he can detect that then his engineering level must be at least high level possibly even Master Level like mine this kid named ywu must be closely monitored Pang haa sweating said if Master Li ji has spoken then let him handle it but don't spare this kid after that he Ste back let's go I still have to check the next mineral site Master lahai remained silent and did not respond in its heart Pang hul cursed damn it what's with the pretense if it worked for the fact that you are the only Construction Master of the corporation I wouldn't even give you face as a member of the board of directors if you don't choose a side and keep being neutral just wait when the one trained by mokai Young Master becomes a construction master your doom will come Li JSI said your name is Yi Wu right follow me I have something I want to ask you yiu replied okay in his heart he thought this old man seems quite formidable just one sentence made Pang leave but he suddenly intervened in this matter I wonder what his intention is both of them headed to the Operations Command room Yu wondered does this command room have so many surveillance screens could it be that the stealth drones from before were also released by you monitor us hearing this Liah C nodded indeed you are very smart but that was an order from above we are just following the directives he said thanks to that I accidentally discovered an interesting thing previously when I saw your Superior being brought into the dungeon I was a bit surprised but now I seem to understand at least a little I didn't expect that you being so young would have reached such a high level in engineering based on the mining robot you created earlier if I'm not mistaken you have at least achieved the level of advanced engineering all the employees were astonished unable to believe this kid has achieved an advanced level in engineering no way absolutely no way are you doubting the teacher's judgment he absolutely cannot be mistaken but for this kid to reach such a high level could it be the talent that people often talk about ywu scratched his head and laughed haha have I been discovered truly worthy of being the only engineering Master of the corporation I completely cannot Escape your eyes so how you plan to Handle Me Now Master liai replied handle you no calling you here is not to handle you but to invite you there's no need to doubt you are a rare talent in Engineering in the current team I'm afraid it will only hold you back he said I recommend that you disband that newly established first level combat team and reassign them to my construction Department based on your cap abilities money status and fame are all things that must be had Yu politely declined thank you for your kind suggestion Master my interest in construction studies is only a passing one merely a secondary hobby for me without any high expectations the staff reacted vehemently to his refusal a passing interest a secondary hobby you already have high level abilities yet you still say this are you looking down on construction studies your comment has insulted the history of several hundred years of construction studies and the countless Scholars who have devoted themselves to this field in search of progress you must immediately apologize upon hearing this yiu explained there has been a misunderstanding I do not mean to look down on construction studies on the contrary I fully understand its significance I have great respect for Scholars like you however personally I prefer to be on the front line determining real Combat rather than researching in the background therefore I can only decline your kind suggestion Master hearing such firm words Master Elijah sigh could only sigh all right although it's somewhat regrettable everyone has their aspirations so I respect your decision Additionally you need not worry about your combat teams accumulated points being deducted I will handle your ranking on my end Yu replied thank you master unexpectedly he continued but helping with this matter isn't free considering a favor that you owe me with your talents it's hard to predict your future there may come a day when you need to help me in return hearing this Yu was somewhat surprised previously he had thought this old man was arrogant but he didn't expect him to be so straightforward in person you flatter me too much Yu said if there's anything I can help with just let me know as long as it's within my abilities I will definitely do my best just then the room was suddenly enveloped by flashing red from an alert notification everyone in the room panicked not understanding what was happening why did the alarm signal suddenly go off like that Master liai calmed everyone down signaling them to be calm what's going on at this moment gwan chuan's image appeared on the screen and he said lii we have an emergency situation on our end and need to report to you the situation is quite complicated please take a look Master Liah Sai said seriously ler G Wang Chuan aren't you investigating the Lost place the layer of the race in the center of the dungeon what has happened immediately after the large screen connected to a camera and the images displayed shocked everyone on the screen was the terrifying sight of insect waves the insects were thick and dense forming a wave with no apparent end making anyone who looked at it shiver G Wang chew and explained the situation as he saw it the insect Army has exerted all its strength more over the timing of their attack is much earlier than we anticipated the number of enemy troops is also several times greater than expected it seems they want to eliminate us immediately Master lii anxiously said then you must quickly return to reinforce before the insects attack the base however contrary to his expectations ji Wang Chu replied no we will not return Li GSI suddenly exclaimed what gwang Chuan continued the insects have committed all their forces their defenses at their Lair must be very loose right now this is a perfect opportunity to strike so we will not return the defense of the base can only rely on you to hold out as long as you can withstand until we take down the insect Nest that will be sufficient Master Ray exclaimed this strategy is too risky the repair work at the base has only just begun mong's team has basically um how long until the insect Army reaches my base Wang cheu and asked 4 hours he replied hearing this the staff lost their composure one person shouted 4 hours with our current pace and Manpower we can't possibly finish the defensive project in time we've been deceived another person tried to calm them down hey let's stay calm however he could no longer endure it he ran towards the door yelling as he ran I won't do it anymore I want to go home when he got close to the door he collided with pangua who was entering the control room caught off guard Pang Hua swore damn it can't you watch where you're going at that moment a cold laser shot through the forehead of the person trying to escape he collapsed and died on the spot Pang hula shouted in panic ah the one who did it is Master Li jaai he declared loudly my construction department has no need to absorb energy whoever dares to escape will meet this end everyone who witnessed the scene echoed yes yes master master Liah outside turned to the newcomer and asked Pang haa do you have business in my construction Department Pang ha after witnessing the recent event broke out in a sweat his face pale but still trying to maintain a strong voice shouted hauh are you asking me I want to ask you what you are doing here the information about ji Wang Chuan has just been seen throughout the base and in 4 hours the insect Army will arrive meanwhile your construction department is still dottling here shouldn't you hurry up and speed up the progress of the defense construction I don't want to die here hurry up Master liai coldly replied I work without needing your command I advise you to quickly hide underground to protect yourself all construction units listen up he commanded immediately start operations the deadline is 3 hours the entire defense project must be completed all Personnel quickly focused and moved to their designated phans responding in unison yes gradually the defense system began to take shape and sealed spaces were constructed in his heart the master contemplated even if we exert all our strength to complete the project in 3 hours the defense capability can only withstand a certain amount of insects but this time the number of insects is too large can we hold them off Yu spoke up mastered judging by your expression I guess you also feel that the situation is not optimistic but sorry I have to add fuel to the fire the master was surprised what do you mean Yu continued before returning I scouted hang jang's base and discovered important information hang Jang intends to exploit our fight against the insects to launch a surprise attack the master was stunned what Li's face darkened Wang Jang wants to Ambush US based on past experiences this is indeed their style ye w added but the scale of the insect this time is much larger than before they also can't enjoy the benefits alone right if they don't take action to resist in the end they will suffer the fate of fish in a bowl the master replied that's not necessarily the case because the place they chose to build their base is in the canyon behind us even though the mineral vein there is poor it is very safe meanwhile our base is situated in an area with Rich mineral veins close to the insect's layer and the area where the insects attack we will block most of the insects for them so they might not take action yiu rubbed his forehead the current situation is really difficult so what about our Retreat can we withdraw from the dungeon first then wait to gather more forces and come back however Master Li answer completely extinguished that idea that's not possible to activate the large scale teleportation gay of the dungeon requires a large amount of energy the energy was fully used up to open the door before currently the teleportation gate is in the process of recharging and it is expected to take at least another 10 hours to complete so everyone must be prepared for a fight until the end here Pang hul was dissatisfied and shouted what kind of mentality are we talking about I don't want to die here with you all he said even if you all die I cannot die what kind of work are you doing in your construction Department the group is really wasting money on you he raised his voice almost losing control don't hide behind later you must be at the front line for me defending the stronghold is the responsibility of your construction Department if you can't even handle this small matter you might as well just die Master Raz approached slapping him hard startling him back to reality calm down the slap Megan crouched down crying uncontrollably who Master ordered Pang hul is tired take him down to the underground bunker to rest once ordinate replied yes then he encouraged the entire Army right now we are facing a daunting task I cannot promise you anything but I can say that as the commander of the base I will absolutely not flee in battle I will stand with you until the very last moment doing everything I can to protect the base the staff had different opinions some were skeptical can we really hold our ground others said since there's nowhere left to hide we might as well fight to the death another person replied but how should we fight defending the construction in such a short time we couldn't even stop the normal insect waves from before let alone face things that are several times stronger now Master liai said according to Common logic that is indeed the case but currently there has appeared an abnormal variable if this variable truly exists then perhaps there is still a chance for the situation to turn around as he spoke he glanced at Yu everyone was puzzled variable what is that that's right Master Lia sag replied that variable is you ye who look bewildered pointing to himself me liai explained for example if you are a master of construction studies then the hope of winning would be higher hearing this the staff felt disheartened the flicker of hope that had just ignited was abruptly extinguished him are you mistaken Master how could he possibly be master of construction studies hoping on this kid is like hoping that a monster runs head first into a wall in contrast to them ye Wu responded I cannot deny it you have a Keen Eye for people all right I won't pretend anymore let's show our cards I have indeed reached the level of a master of construction studies tell me what you need me to do his words left everyone astonished and doubtful what he really dares to claim he is a master of construction studies is there really such a young master of construction studies in the world don't deceive people Master Liah Sai ignored the criticisms and turned Yu I need you to go to the front line in front of the base to build a defensive barrier to directly confront the insect attacks you should try to wear them down buying time for the main base to complete its defenses Yi Wu replied Oh you mean for me to go die but I understand this logic if I were you I would arrange it the same way however the difficulty of this task has exceeded the level that your good willll can compensate for he continued I can agree to your unreasonable request but what benefits are you going to give me everyone around was surprised by his words and began to criticize at a time like this you still ask for benefits are you even human someone like you is not worthy of being a master I'm afraid if you survive you won't dare to spend a dime y Wu calmly responded to the criticisms what I hate most is hypocrisy if it comes to seeking death I can do that but I must have benefits as well aren't you all here for the sake of profit don't tell me you came here to be food for the insects everyone fell silent Master lii replied rest assured if we can survive I will definitely reward you appropriately he said I take the honor of the master of construction education from the hanmo group as a promise I will not go back on my word hearing this yiu nodded in agreement spreading his wings to fly towards the door I trust you the situation cannot be delayed I will head to the front line first as for the forward position you chose and the drawings related to the defense construction once they are completed send them to me immediately the master replied understood all the resources of the base will be devoted to you helping you build the defense station with all our might Our Fate is all in your hands Yu thought as he flew to be honest he did not care about the fate of these people he told himself because I am not the kind of hero who pursues righteousness I do everything only for the person I care about just that at that moment Yun feay contacted him brother have you seen the video just now the insects have arrived ye Wu interrupted her Yan Fe and everyone else I have something to say you all Lu Fang upon hearing the news exclaimed anxiously what senior do you want to go to the front line alone isn't this courting death Ru tyen tyan couldn't hide or Panic facing the insects alone even y Wu cannot Kai XI couldn't contain her emotions and shouted angrily vwoo where are you I want to go with you but yanf stopped him it's best for us to stay here yanf said to everyone does my brother not understand the consequences of doing this he doesn't mind the danger it's all for us if we continue to hold him back what does that mean after hearing this everyone lowered their heads remaining silent sensing the tense atmosphere Yu smiled and said yanf really understands her brother the best she's truly his sister but can you not speak as if he's already doomed don't worry he knows his limits yanf replied yeah brother we all trust you you'll definitely be able to do it YW continued of course our King team has a bright future how can we possibly fail leave it to your captain after ending the communication with yanf he called nana I need her help tell her to gather with me at this location Nana was frantically Mining and upon hearing yiwu's call she immediately stopped and responded ah got it Master she immediately set off at the Gathering point yeide the place liai chose is not bad I think this place is indeed very suitable for building the entire Outpost relying on the mountain formation on both sides creates a natural barrier I just need to block the main entrance in the middle Nana agreed saying that's right y w continue to observe and comment it but this is only a theoretical advantage in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers any strategy becomes useless all fears stem from a lack of Firepower therefore let's place all the landmines on the path that the insects must pass through in front I want to create a surprise for the insect swarm n knowled the order yes master the systems voice announced that Nana had received 58 Advanced spider landmines with strong explosive power after that yiu called iiv viz over and commanded bring the most powerful weapons and the advanced blueprints along with the best defensive props here I Vis responded Yes master ye W seriously contemplated although I'm not sure how large the insect wave will be I will give it my all absolutely absolutely no one must get through then he shouted come here the defense tower is starting to operate we have 3 hours before the insects invade the first step of the forward defense station is to build a resource transfer device to move resources from the rear base to the front line yiu looked at the device shaped like a miniature antenna and continued this area is the most critical part of the entire teleport station with it destroyed all types of weapons of the entire Outpost will be unusable due to the loss of of their energy Supply at that moment a wall of iron slowly Rose from the ground yiu flew higher to observe and said the second step is to build a defense wall however a simple wall will not be able to withstand the aggressive assault of the insects I need to add some enhancements to it the AI robot viz immediately proceeded merging and upgrading the defense wall and the shield creating a completely new defensive Shield wall the system updated the information about this device level 80 Shield wall durability 100% barrier index 100% ywu intently looked at the screen and said next is the most important defensive weapon let's see these are mainly self-limiting weapons so we can just take as many as we need he pressed a button on the screen to acquire the weapons the system announced level 80 High maneuvering machine gun turret the heavy artillery of level 80 Roar and the level 80 magic Crystal flares also howled fiercely in the operation monitoring room the system continuously issued alerts warning warning resource consumption is too fast exceeding 50% immediate replenishment required everyone in the room was anxious hurriedly checking the information they were astonished how could resource consumption be so high is that kit really defending in a brain dead manner they quickly approached the master seeking his advice Master if this continues our resources will be completely consumed by that kid the defenses of the headquarters will also be affected should we impose restrictions the master turned his face away not looking at them and coldly replied no restrictions accelerate the concentration of resources at the rear and fully support the consumption on Yu's side in his heart he understood the rapid resource consumption was not due to the quantity of machines yiu had but because he had transformed the attributes and levels of the weapons leading to excessive consumption such transformative ability was something even a master builder like him could not achieve on the other side Yi Wu with Nana stood before the massive construction that had just been completed he crossed his arms gazing at it and said with satisfaction building The Fortress like this should be secure we cannot consume all the resources we need to lead some to the headquarters Nana looked at the Fortress and couldn't help but exclaim no wonder it's the master this this defensive formation is indeed as solid as Diamond the system announced there were 30 minutes before the insects invaded yiu quickly gave the order there's only 30 minutes left next we should strengthen our defenses come out Crimson Comet the red dragon appeared joyfully calling out upon seeing ywu Nana looked at the small dragon and broke out in a sweat its whole body was equipped with iron armor and weapons when did this guy start raising battle pets wouldn't be more difficult for me to kill him now M Yu stroke the dragon's head then turn to give an order to the AI robot viz AA Vis check if there are any suitable modification plans for Crimson comet in the storage the AI robot viz happily replied understood Master you're currently in a state of mos frenzy Crimson comet is very suitable for modification into a Mech a combat bone modification plan has been detected thanks for the support of knee Yi Wu said his eyes glued to the information panel that the AI robot V had opened he was astonished oh the attributes and resistance are very good this was originally meant for humans but it still needs some modification he quickly pressed the select button the AI robot Vis cheerfully said this is basically a small matter for you master y w looked at the red dragon and smiled this is a new gift I want to give you hurry up and equip it crimsom comet's entire body burst into red Flames appearing larger it emitted a thrilling growl the whole body of the violent Dragon Beast was now covered in a new battle armor from head to toe on its back there were additional weapons like guns and bows its teeth were also sharper Yu admired its new appearance and said with satisfaction yeah not bad very impressive crimsom Comet extended its claws and scratched the ground creating a loud noise bam y wo tapped its armored head and cheerfully praised absolutely awesome with you there I feel much more at ease hearing yiwu's praise Crimson Comet squinted its eyes in Joy making a hey sound Nana standing beside admired and said so slay however deep down Nana secretly cursed creatures of this level are not lacking on my planet what's so special about it I'm not jealous of its new equipment at all not even a little y Wu turned to Nana and happily said Nana come here I will upgrade your equipment too after all we have to face a strong enemy later Nana's eyes widened in excitement as she asked what I get to have it too although appearing excited on the outside when she turned away she scowled and thought to herself no matter how much you upgrade my equipment I will never give up my determination to kill you when she turned back to face Yu she lowered her head and shyly replied thank you master in her mind she thought how can a low-level being like a human understand the strength and beauty of machines Nana recalled her previous captivating and beautiful form reminiscing that she had once been a magnificent machine embodying both Beauty and Majesty I once possessed eternal life and a perfect body while the lowly creature before me is nothing more than an ant how could it possibly perceive the mysterious wonders of Machinery as she was sinking into her thoughts Nana suddenly felt something strange in her body mom why is my body so hot is something invading inside seeing the worried look on her face y Wu hurriedly reassured her don't be afraid I am in the process of reconstructing your body hang in there for a bit now Nana's body was equipped with armor from head to toe even adorned with wings and Firepower forming the shape of a battle Angel Nana looked at herself in confusion this form felt like armor wings and weapons were really light and comfortable she really wanted to immediately unleash this endless Firepower Yu looked at her and asked so Nana do you like this design she shyly replied I like it thank you master Yu reached out to Pat Nana's head happily saying that's good later you have to give it your all NaNa is an important support too she bowed her head and responded Yes inside she began to worry wondering wondering what's going on my body feels too hot could it be that I'm overloaded after finishing all the preparations ye who stood and looked ahead next is my turn I recall being taught back in school that the attributes of insects are very complex almost impossible to create attributes that counter them but they do have a common weakness he continued to gaze ahead silently thinking the exoskeleton of insects is inherently resistant to cold weapons only heat weapons with piercing capabilities can effectively inflict damage on them based on her combat experience Nana had faced thousands of centipedes and her Divine Warrior form had dealt significant damage to the Monstrous beasts perhaps this principle would be effective again he opened the screen on the system and said to IZ so we need to put that design on the field the design that young Master moai sent me at first the one I realized was right after looking at it once I Vis was surprise oh the map finally wants to use that so exciting he stared intently at the screen and seriously said I just don't know how many resources it will consume to create it never mind we can't worry too much about that right now I Vis start the robot IIs quickly responded Yes master in the combat monitoring room the system continued to flash red and warning sounds rang out continuously warning warning warning check showed that in an instant a large amount of resources had been consumed the resources of the main base were extremely scarce liai stood in front of the flashing red screen silently saying nothing everyone began to murmur what what is this kiddo doing again they panicked pointing at the screen and shouting quick look at that what is it liit asai stared at the screen that is the bloody Phantom a large robot fully equipped with heavy weapons slowly walked forward the booming sound was deafening and everyone watching it couldn't help but exclaim the Machinery is so cool a large robot with a blood red exterior stomped forward each step resonating with a thunderous sound its appearance left I viz in awe exclaiming this is so cool this is the romance of men Yu looked at the robot with excitement and pride then said not bad give it a try robot I Vis was equally enthusiastic and replied don't worry Master just let me handle the specifics since I have a mind connection with you you only need to provide reactions and judgments the system began scanning data accurately confirming the identity and starting to load when the scanning process was complete ywu quickly settled into the control seat inside the robot he exclaimed with Glee this is so convenient robot I've this happily responded of course with your abilities and Consciousness even operating it personally would achieve a Master's level I just want to make things easier for you Yu smiled and said thank you yiu sat in the bloody Phantom robot listening to Nana outside reporting Master there is a high energy response ahead the insect Army is about to approach yiu prepared himself thinking finally it has come yes Nana transfer the live feed to me Yi Wu commanded Nana quickly complied and activated the system outside thousands of Beast appeared crowded and ferocious the system signaled that due to the overwhelming number of insect waves it needed 2 minutes for further calculation yiu was pensive reflecting on G wine chuan's warning the number of insect waves this time exceeds the previous ones previously yiu did not have a clear concept of the figures but now seeing it with his own eyes he began to worry whether he could fend them off lost in thought yiu was startled when he felt his robot Shake violently this is not the time to hesitate the enemy is approaching in the monitoring room of the base everyone was astonished one person spoke up an earthquake Liah 2 looked at the screen and calmly replied no it's due to the insect Army getting closer the sounds of trembling from their marching along the ground resonated to the base everyone in the monitoring room couldn't help but be amazed and worried asking each other this is truly terrifying how many insects must there be to create such a massive Tremor ran xong gritted his teeth in anger and shouted holy [ __ ] these damn creatures we have to fight to the death the Army has been mobilized Lu Chang Fang Stood Beside him looking at everyone seriously and said no matter what we must stay here anyone who dares to flee in battle will be severely punished no exceptions everyone shouted in unison yes Wen H's group looked at them frowning and saying right now we can only trust the senior he has always been the man who creates Miracles and this time will definitely be no different yanf Stood Beside him worriedly asking has my brother already fought with the insects twight Le agreed with Juan how Hing Yan FEI and said I also believe in yu he will definitely return safely in front of them was a busy scene ywu sat in the bloody Phantom robot staring at the iron door thinking deeply right now it is impossible to eradicate the insects completely but at least we must use every capability to reduce their numbers buying time for the main base to construct additional defensive structures and alleviate the defensive pressure the system announced 30 seconds left before the insects invade in the distance dust was Rising the insects had appeared Master the insects have entered the firing range should we launch an attack a voice echoed Yu quickly ordered don't panic let the defense fire first wait until we eliminate one wave of insects before we strike at that moment the bloody Phantom robot began to unleash a barriage of bullets each large projectile flying swiftly at Yu's command the first shot of this campaign was one Yi Wu wanted to take himself bullets rained down like a storm upon the swarm of insects causing them to explode in pieces The Continuous sound of explosions echoed the onlookers could not help but Marvel at the power of the machine its Firepower was utterly devastating the insects that had just Advanced were disintegrated under the barage the insects that were hit let out wretched cries but unexpectedly even more insects emerged circling around the city wall the creatures sprang forward with their sharp claws at level 45 racing towards them everyone in the master inside the observation room could not hide their fear the number of insects was far greater than anticipated finally the high maneuvering machine gun turret rated at level 80 also began firing targeting the swarm of insects the sound of gunfire erupted as each insect was pierced and Shattered by the bullets on the screen appeared the image of a high maneuvering machine gun turret causing everyone to Marvel at ywu incredible the Firepower of this Machinery turret is much higher than the usual standards how could this kiddo do it suddenly a level 60 corrosive F spider appeared everyone became anxious not good the corrosive spider has appeared they understood that the corrosive liquid spewed by this insect had extremely strong corrosive properties and could shoot very far even walls made of steel could be dissolved they began to spray the first wave of green liquid but the machine gun turret quickly detected and deployed a shield to block it the corrosive liquid was stopped outside the wall astonishing everyone that's an energy Shield our walls don't have this function furthermore as long as the resource concentration continues the shields index will automatically recover it's too powerful system notification level 80 Shield durability 100% Shield index 60% although it can defend well the corrosive F spider is still beyond the machine turret's attack range and cannot inflict effective damage suddenly everyone was even more surprised when they saw the system switched to a longrange heavy Cannon level 80 the cannon fired producing a loud explosion that caused everyone in the surveillance room to exclaim this heavy artillery although its attack speed is not high has an extremely powerful range and might next switch to the level 80 magic Crystal flare Cannon one of the commanders stated as the cannon fired the projectiles clustered together like small planets eliminating before exploding obliterating an entire swarm of insects this is amazing this weapon is incredibly powerful this is fundamentally an overwhelming assault if we continue to attack like this we can win someone confidently asserted unlike the excitement and admiration everyone had for ywo master Li s frowned intently staring at the screen with a worried expression he murmured no it can't be this simple the system has yet to provide the specific quantity which indicates suddenly the whole surveillance room was bathed in red as the system emitted an alarm warning warning warning warning the system has checked the specific quantity of the insects people looked at each other in astonishment what's going on the system continued to announce compared to the standard average quantity of insects in the past the number of invading insects this time is someone shouted in panic everyone look over there on the screen appears the red text the remaining number of insect waves is 1,000% everyone in the monitoring room was so terrified that they were trem Ling that means the number of insect waves invading this time is 10 times that of before How can there be so many one person sat down Whispering it's over completely over we will All Die Here liai frowned staring at the screen he thought the worst case scenario I predicted before was only five times now it's risen to 10 times this time we are defeated even with Yi Wu fighting on the front line it will be useless inside the bloody Phantom robot Yu also frowned 10 times I knew this would be simple but this number is really hard to believe is it because our human race has invaded their territory too much causing them to become angry he looked at the screen and all you could see were insects everywhere but that didn't matter What mattered was that my partner was still in the rear and I absolutely could not let you get there even though I wasn't sure I could do it I would fight until the last moment Yu was determined not to give up up and he quickly ordered Nana crimsom Comet it's our turn to take the field without my command absolutely do not Retreat Nana flying on the left quickly replied understood Master crimsom Comet flying on the right also chimed in yeah yeah both of them immediately charged into the attack let's go y wo shouted loudly the robot bloody Phantom began to fight with continuous gunfire erupting explosions booming boom boom speed increased by 30% y woo shouted come on open all Firepower the robot spun around continuously firing at the insect waves the system reported the remaining number of insect waves was 950 on the side of crimson Comet they were also relentlessly tearing into the swarm of insects the system reported REM insect count 880 at this moment the level 60 venomous mosquitoes had appeared watching from outside one of the mosquitoes sneered these humans had some skill but they're all just a marine team up in the air they have no defense at all all of you will die suddenly Nana appeared charging straight into the swarm of venomous mosquitoes she frowned and shouted loudly who gave you the courage to say we can't control things in the air in her heart nna thought Master no that little boy is quite something knowing how to create such a nice flying gear for me but that doesn't mean I'll give up my intention to kill him Nana swam her sword gripping the hilt tightly with both hands her wings equipped with Firearms she fought passionately with each violent strike resounding boom boom boom she smiled subtly secretly marveling this gear is not bad allowing me to kill freely your day of death can be postponed for now let me eliminate all these disgusting insects first and then we'll see the system reported again remaining insect counts 700% meanwhile inside the robot the screen displayed an all Red Alert warning warning ammunition count below 30% AV Vis spoke up Master the ammunition is insufficient now if it goes on like this it's better to concentrate all the ammunition for the ultimate finish skill of this robot Yu was surprised the ultimate finish skill well going for broke is better than small skirmishes I'll leave it to you IIs I Vis immediately responded understood Master fire away Yi Wu quickly commanded the other two Nana crimsom Comet immediately Retreat from the area within a kilometer in front of me I want to go big now Nana quickly replied Roger crimsom Comet also agreed g g on the other side the insect swarm looked at the bullet spheres flying towards them and mocked what do these spiders think they're doing just give up against our absolute numbers any resistance is feudal ha suddenly the insect swarm panicked sweating what is that are they giving us a big mushroom a loud explosion e coded the system reported remaining the insect count 500% everyone was astonished damn it the power of this Grand move is truly formidable it's just that the name of this skill is too un serious the system emitted a warning sound warning warning ammunition count 0% ammunition count 0% the bullets on the blood colored illusion robot began to fade away holding a steel pencil in its hand it remain determined to charge forward and Massacre the swarm of the insect Bam Bam it's fine if the ranged weapon can't be used then switched to close combat the swarm of the insect screamed in fear upon seen blood colored illusion ah don't come over here the robot swung its weapon down on the insects causing them to explode ah ah yigu quickly commanded no matter what we must hold this position until the end Nana responded understood Crimson Comet acknowledged the order G gr ran Shong hearing this felt moved boss you chose to hold out until the end for us L Chang Fang looked at the screen worried not good the signal from the surveillance camera is lost could it be that the insect has sabotaged the teleportation Talisman resource equipment of the station Juan how at this moment blamed himself shouting damn it if I were just a bit stronger I could have helped why am I so weak Y young F stare at the screen anxious brother both suai and kxi were also worried I'm sorry he woo hang in there you can definitely do it at this moment everyone in the surveillance room wanted to rush out and fight together let's go help we can't let him bear this alone someone said that's right after all we are a high- ranking team and we absolutely cannot let a level one brother protect us like this instead of sitting around waiting for death we should take the initiative to strike they said excitedly wanting to go into battle but just then the system announced the Bas is currently in a locked State no one is allowed to go outside please stay in your positions and wait for orders everyone asked in dissatisfaction why then Lei appear on the monitoring screen calmly saying I am very pleased to see that you maintain your fighting spirit in the face of panic but we need to analyze the situation clearly if even y wo cannot hold on going outside would only be seeking death after pausing for a moment he looked around at everyone and continued now please return to your designated defensive positions be ready to welcome the enemy and do not let y's efforts go to waste as he finished speaking everyone below gradually calmed down lii looked at the screen displaying the words signal lost pondering gwo you have brought us too many surprises if the number of enemies does not exceed expectations you might even be able to handle the situation on your own but right now I cannot do anything to help you I'm sorry outside died Nana was still trying to eliminate the swarm of flying insects but their numbers were overwhelming M these damn pests are too many buzzing around my ears driving me crazy cough cough cough her health was currently at only 35% and her life force was at 10% on the other side Crimson Comet was also facing a group of insects clinging tightly around his body gor G they were hanging on Crimson Comet biting and knowing growling aha die but Crimson comet's Health was only at 25% and his life force was at 30% the system reported the remaining number of the insects is 300% and the damage to blood colored illusion has reached 98% Yu was sitting inside gasping and exhausted Huff Huff he thought to himself am I finally reaching my limit although the destructive power of these insects is astonishing this is still close combat and their numbers are not decreasing ing moreover he glanced at the teleport station surrounded by thousands of insects wreaking havoc the resource teleportation Talisman has been destroyed most of the defensive weapons are no longer usable if the insects break through the final defensive structure they will charge straight into the base y Wu is thinking of another way is the only option now to open a shadow cane account but how much longer will it take to spend my remaining assets he gritted his teeth and decided to proceed even if my heart is bleeding I won't hold back anymore system changed to Shadow King before he could finish his command Yu notice that snowflakes began to appear around him hey are those snowflakes why are there snowflakes on the battlefield suddenly a large sword descended from above it was the sky Frost Blade the insects caught in the strike died on the spot ah Yu was stunned as he looked at a girl standing high above looking down arrogantly that's Hulu the Ace of the emperor group level 140 he was taken aback looking at the sword through the cracked screen of the robot she's one of the top tier fighters of the Huong xen group aren't they trying to play us why are they helping now what is their aim Sulu glanced at yiu with a hint of admiration and then scoffed saying ha daring to face a large- scale insect attack alone while very courageous is also incredibly foolish she jumped down from the large sword which began to shatter into pieces however this level of skill is far from enough the insect swarm looked at her making strange sounds another soft-skinned human looks so delicious come on come on hurry into my mouth she quickly used the ice bone strike and the cold air from her instantly froze and killed the swarm of insects gr she's too strong Sulu tossed a piece of green stone into the sky smiling at the swarm of insects you want to eat me go ahead if you bugs are strong enough I wouldn't mind letting you bite and swallow me immediately a snowflake formation appeared surrounding her the insects screamed in fear that magic crystal is she smiled and said summon magic Crystal Frost goddess sharp and hard snowflakes blew down making the insects even more terrified what is she what is she planning to do Sulu used the skill permafrost breath covering the entire area instantly freezing the entire insect swarm the system announced permafrost breath the ultimate magic of the frost goddess deals damage within a radius of 500 M immobilizing targets for 1 minute if prolonged they will be frozen to death the system announced remaining number of insects 250% at this moment the insects began to panic screaming as they look for a way to escape run run away the robot blood colored illusion stood watching the massive wave approaching in front of it boom y woo panicked and exclaimed is this an indiscriminate attack is she planning to take me down too it's over the robot can't move anymore Crimson Comet the Red Dragon quickly rushed in to Shield him y Wu felt a deep fear this is too dangerous this girl is really terrifying she just appeared and is already going all out look looking down at the Raging wave Yu saw the bodies of thousands of the insects along with the remains of the robot blood colored illusion about to be frozen the system reported the remaining number of the insects is up to 200% he couldn't help but be astonished is it really possible to annihilate such a massive number of the insects with just one move is this the power of level 140 Yu thought to himself but she has destroyed my robot blood colored illusion this debt must be settled with her in the glowing formation Sulu stood tall facing the swarming insects that were growling and preparing to charge they cheered her big move is used up let's rush in no matter how strong she is she can't kill all our swarm by herself ha let's tear her apart Sulu crossed her arms calmly observing the insects she scoffed who said I only have one big move just after finishing her words the Frost death Walts was UN leashed causing them to be frozen once again unable to Counterattack the systems voice echoed the remaining quantity of the insect is 150% nanao was still hard at work Exterminating the flying bugs haha keep coming you damned insects come here suddenly a green light unexpectedly struck her position AK n exclaimed I was startled Yi Wu quickly used his shield to block that light for her he cautioned her Don be careful even though you're focused on killing the enemy you can't disregard your surroundings ye Wood's Health was only at 40% and his life Essence had dropped to 30% Nana looked at him touched and stammered master master Sulu looked at the two with interest and said oh you actively took my attack without dying that's really interesting the energy emanating from you could it be that the rat who peeed outside the main base was you ye woo with one one hand blocking her attack and the other protecting Nana calmly responded so you discovered that no wonder you were level 140 Powerhouse though I almost got swept away by your attack waves I must admit your appearance has saved me I have to thank you for that Nana did not care about what they were saying only focusing intently on him thinking earlier he risked his life to save me suu jumped down to ywu she looked at him and said if you can see that my level is 140 then surely your level is roughly similar with every step Sulu took snowflakes and Ice spread out towards that direction anyway thanks for standing on the opposing side if you lack confidence then you are just foolish Nana hit behind guu secretly observing susulu this woman looks very dangerous Yu looked at susulu and said seriously I am very clear about love and hate thank you is thank you but the debt you have caused by ruining my monster robot I will remember to settle Sulu looked at him with interest really how intriguing I have never met anyone who dared to speak to me like that she crossed her arms looking at Yu and asked I am very curious to see how you will collect your debt from me but before that moment arrives you still have something to do she pointed behind him her voice hotty it's to survive Yu was shocked and turned to look behind what a huge demon Beast appeared sto in along followed by a swarm of insects trailing behind the system reported the remaining number of the insect is 100% Yu looked at the demon beast in front of him and exclaimed the boss of the insect Abyssal Mammoth Weevil level 110 he thought when the insect is down to 100% will the boss appear could this be her goal Yu glanced back and said indeed an excellent plan first intervene to deplete the number of the In Waves beforehand avoiding the impact on Wang Jen group's base second let the boss of the insect ravage hanm Mo group's base you didn't spend a single soldier and if hanm grou can't hold them off what then using the smallest cost to obtain the greatest benefit Sulu simply smiled and gradually faded away I'm not interested in meaningless conflicts and the boring struggles for corporate interests only disgust me I do this just to have something to report to the senior leaders of the corporation Yu did not look at her calmly replying actually it doesn't need to be that complicated with your abilities taking down the entire base of hanmo group alone is not impossible before disappearing completely Sulu did not forget to compliment you are smarter than I thought she continued but the Gap in strength cannot be compensated by mere cleverness if you can survive I greatly look forward to the day you come to collect your debt from me yiu furrowed his brows at at her your disappearance is exactly likeu he's retreating method from before however I never expected that within such a short time I would encounter three girls with the surname sh sui sule and heulu could there be a connection between them never mind this is not the time to think about that Yu looked at the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil charging toward him I must quickly figure out a way to deal with it or all my previous efforts will go to waste he in thought the insect waves have reduced to normal numbers I can let them pass the main base should still be able to defend itself I need to focus all my energy on confronting the boss he remembered the communication station but the teleportation Talisman resource station has been destroyed and the communication with the main base has also been cut off surely the base still doesn't know about kulu's appearance I must report the battle situation to the main base so everyone can prepare to deal with the Enemy thinking this he immediately ordered Nana use your fastest speed to inform Le gai about the Battle situation here for defensive support Nana was astonished to see her wounds had healed is this me restored already that guy gave me all his remaining resources Yu shouted stop Doling hurry up Nana was startled as she looked at him okay okay Nana quickly rushed forward is he planning to face the boss alone don't die if if you do die it can only be by my hands Yu was riding at top the Crimson Comet and commanded let's go Crimson Comet we must hold our ground here we cannot let the boss preach the defense in the monitoring room of the base someone said the signal ahead has been cut has the teleportation Talisman resource station been destroyed a crackling sound echoed and the screen displayed the message number of insects remaining 350% everyone was anxious it's over how can there still be so many insects although that guy has reduced the number of insects from 1,000% to 350% that's still beyond our defensive capabilities they were disheartened we're definitely going to die why GSI Stood Still deep in thought it's been a while since we've lost contact with the front lines but why hasn't y Wu returned yet I had told him to retreat quickly when he could no longer hold on could it be that he values his life less than my old life Li just I thought seeing a rookie with infinite potential like that die makes one feel regret but all is not over yet a final conclusion cannot be drawn he shouted loudly lift up your spirits for me now is not the time to give up if anyone continues to be negative or pessimistic I will have that person killed immediately everyone was startled quickly calming themselves and together shouted yes yes teacher ruin tanan cried and asked yanf what's going on have you made contact with yiu yet Yuni held the small screen that had lost signal in his hand and shook his head no even using the communication device from the base we still can't get in touch kayak hexi sitting beside anxiously said how can this be Yi Wu is risking his life on the front lines and we don't know anything about his situation it's so frustrating Yun F spoke to comfort everyone don't worry he will definitely be fine he has never let us down before right juanell gritted his teeth and said that's right we must trust our senior who knows maybe right now the senior is dealing with the remnants and the general of the species picking up equipment until this hands are sore in his heart he understood in Yun fe's heart he is more worried about the senior's safety than anyone else he thought but I have to try to appear composed to reassure everyone I cannot let her bear the burden alone he looked out the window his hands clenched silently thinking even though what I want most is to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the senior fighting on the front lines as the only man here at this moment I will definitely protect them at all costs don't worry senior at the current speed we will reach the main base in another 5 minutes Nana quickly soared ahead exuding confidence hemp how dare you stand in front of me with such little calculation and shame yourself to be precise it will be 5 minutes and 8 seconds before we arrive she glanced at the swarm of insects chasing her thinking while I know I can easily outpace the insects and reach the base safely why not take this opportunity to slay a few monsters and earn some experience points she frowned I don't understand why the last time I killed so many insects it didn't grant me any experience points let's try again now besides I've already entered the protective zone of the base later I just need to send a message back to the base this way I'm not defying his orders thinking that Nana cheerfully turned around preparing to fight the swarm of insects she fired bullets and weapons at them thinking to herself this way I can safely kill the monsters haha I'm really too smart the bombardment was relentless watching her experience points continuously rise Nana was happy finally she was gaining more experience she laughed haha I want even more system notification experience points gained 3,000 experience points gained 3,000 experience points gained 3,000 nanana fought like crazy glancing at the system panel and seeing she had reached level 70 she joyfully said at this rate I might quickly surpassed the true level escaping his control haha the swarm of insects exploded suddenly a demon Beast emerged from the sea of flames charging straight at Nana and striking her injuring her instantly her health dropped to 40% with only 20% of her life left she gritted her teeth and thought what's happening did I just get attacked the demon Beast was a golden armored mantis Elite level 85 it looked at Nana growling humans still don't know life and death you originally had a chance to escape but you turned around to seek death let me help you with that Nana fell to the ground still in shock and thinking an 85 level Elite monster I'm doomed I was too engrossed in the thrill of killing to notice there are highlevel Elite monsters like this when she hit the ground she suddenly remembered I have to send a message to the base immediately Nana stared back in Surprise seeing the golden armored mantis Elite raising its sword die she quickly pressed the distress button Master help I don't want to die Yu stood on the back of the Crimson Comet calmly considering the strategy now is to release a large number of the insects first then I will hold the boss and fight it once the boss is dealt with I'll return to the base to provide support the dragon flew out of the swarm of insects Yu thought quietly the Shadow King is my only finishing blow my Fusion Mission will also take time and burning through resources is not a long-term plan he looked over at the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil pondering I have a bigger question after killing so many insects earlier why haven't I received any any experience points or loot is it a special mechanism am I not going to get anything from effort the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil looked at Yu with an oppressive gaze and said the kind of person who dares to stay behind alone I do not respect your courage but relying on you cannot hold me back nor do you have the qualifications to fight me Yu quickly said I don't have time to waste talking to you open the Shadow King account system the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil immediately three beams of light shot through a IED by small rolling bugs rushing towards him y Wu was startled looked at the information about them on the system and was amazed to discover they are the three Locust Brothers level 95 yiu gritted his teeth and said I said it would be a one-on-one fight yet these guys want to open another Shadow cane to crush me it's really not easy to deal with he looked at the three bugs charging towards him and realized this boss is not only strong but also very cautious I must deal with the these three Elite monsters first then open the Shadow King otherwise my resources will definitely not be enough Yu turn to the red dragon beside him and commanded go Crimson comeet we need to deal with these three Elite monsters in the shortest time possible the red dragon immediately breathed fire and charged to attack g g yigu shouted swinging his sword with great force the health of the three Elite monsters dropped to 20% but immediately after it recovered to 90% Yu gritted his teeth I can't just use one skill and finish them off it seems that besides the damage reduction skills of their race my level is also not enough to suppress them yiu continued furthermore the blood volume instantly recovered could it be that the significance of this special Essence is that the three of them resonate their blood volume and must resolve everything in one go the butt began to Counterattack and yiu quickly pulled out a large Shield to defend bam he quickly requested the system how much can all my current experience points upgrade the linking level of the chaien emperor account the system replied currently the linking level of the chaien emperor is level 100 the most it can be upgraded to his level 105 while slashing another bug yumu looked at the system and continued to ask so low after the previous battle even without counting experience points it shouldn't only increase a little like this right the system responded the linking level of a single account after reaching level 100 requires a significantly larger amount of experience points for each subsequent level please consider carefully before unlocking a new account ye W continue to fend off the swarm of bugs while angrily thinking what is there to consider at such a critical moment this kind of mechanism appears isn't it just trying to take my life he kept grumbling the chyen emperor account cannot inflict destructive damage on bosses and Elite monsters you w thought with such a short amount of time the Shadow King cannot erupt facing so many powerful enemies like this I really don't want to waste time on these monsters suddenly his eyes lit up that's right didn't I obtain the blueprint that excited me so much at the beginning thanks to M's help that weapon is very suitable for dealing with these three Elite monsters Yi Wu quickly moved in another Direction and commanded Crimson Comet leave these three to you for now help me hold them off for 10 seconds the red dragon immediately accepted the order g g Yu called AIS and said AV Vis prepare to craft the weapon based on the blueprint immediately I viz looked at the map and replied all right Master finally it's time to craft this weapon isn't it I can't help but thank M9 once again for the benefits she provided she really understands men too well system notification the final weapon from the other dimension its power is immense but the current technology of the world cannot manufacture it if successfully crafted please be careful to avoid causing irreparable casualties the weapon's characteristic is to bypass all defensive damage reduction while running he asked DZ how long does it take to manufacture this weapon I VI replied 30 seconds because this is the final weapon of the other dimension it cannot be completed in an instant moreover during these 30 seconds the account Moss must always be maintained he panicked what facing the level 90 Elite insect he felt a bit worried oh no crazy Moss is not a combat type account stopping three level 90 Elite insects is too difficult but fortunately in the grand blueprint moai left me with a few other items holding long for these 30 seconds shouldn't be a big problem the opponent immediately charged at him but he remained unscathed the system announced the arrival of a Starlight versatile drone a perfect combination of attack and defense along with a numerical Advantage shining like the brightest star in the night sky however this strategy could not be sustained for long Yu said although the attack power is not considerable it wins with numerical Advantage even if we can't kill them we can still make the opponent uncomfortable at that moment another member of the three Locust Brothers level 95 appeared I Vis shouted loudly Master the weapon is complete please take it he hurriedly turned back and replied okay receiving the weapon in hand yiu was overjoyed it's huge this one immediately gives a feeling of safety the system notified this is the bfgm 3000 the final weapon from the other dimension while its power is tremendous it cannot be manufactured with the current techniques of this world even if it could be made please exercise CAU to avoid unforeseen incidents that could lead to irreparable casualties its characteristic is that it bypasses all defense mechanisms that reduce damage I Vis gleefully analyzed that's right because this is a weapon from the other dimension even a Master Level engineer in this world cannot create it but the downside is the shortage of materials for its manufacturer which is why it only has three shots so it must be used carefully but before he could finish he interrupted and fired the first shot who cares fire one shot and then continue talking IID shouted wait Master why don't you let me finish before firing the shot while powerful can easily be dodged by them he was stunned bewilderedly saying what did it really miss IIs exclaimed ah isn't that a waste of one shot suddenly a black hole appeared causing y Wu to realize wait this is a small black hole so that's how the bfgm 3000 is used as soon as he finished speaking the black hole began to emit a powerful gravitational force pulling the enemies straight in leaving them just enough time to scream ah then they exploded leaving only smoke behind their blood and HP were completely erased leaving no Trace whatsoever both sides looked at each other in astonishment unable to believe what had just happened damn it this power is truly overwhelming I this said I I originally wanted to say that to maximize the effectiveness of these three shots there was another way but now it seems that it may not be necessary anymore monster said the scientific and technological capabilities of your human race have evolved to this level but the human body remains a critical weakness ye W thought looking at my condition right now my stamina is only at 30% my health is only at 40% while I am still enduring extremely powerful attacks from the enemy the system announced the amount of Starlight has reached 80% this made him even more anxious that's right with this body I will be crushed especially in the state of the Moss account he quickly turned to ask a v you just mentioned a way to enhance the power of the weapon quickly tell me the specific operation i' this quickly provided the information among the many titles of crazy Moss there is a title called Firearms Master a vis announced you can use firearm arm skills up to the maximum level doubling the power of the weapon yiu exclaimed I didn't expect Moss to be a sharpshooter I Vis replied to be precise it should be called gun crafting as researching and creating various types of firearms is also a major hobby of moss he hurriedly urged so what are we waiting for the system immediately unlocked the title Firearms Master for Moss the system announced you need 600,000 experience points points to unlock this title do you wish to unlock it yiu decisively said although the cost of this title is more than double that of the previous title The Master Alchemist it is still more economical than if these two shocks fail to deal with the boss unlocking Shadow King later is not too late if we can save we save confirm unlock the system confirmed unlocking the title Firearms Master activates a hidden mechanism automatically unlocking the good friend linked account he was a astonished damn a good friend linked account isn't this like a buy one get one free deal awesome let me see what this account is all about the system announc the account features a vicious man with an unknown name and age proficient in all types of firearms combat with a violent hot-tempered and easily angered personality the system continued to notify due to wandering alone in the universe Gods Kill gods and Buddhas kill Buddhas once in a state of ex rage I destroyed a planet supported by countless demons the system announced after wandering to the planet where Moss resides we became friends due to Shared Madness Moss crafted many powerful weapons so that nothing could hinder me before destroying his own world Moss jumped into a spatial Wormhole from which his whereabouts remain unknown the system said this account cannot be used independently it can only be activated when Firearms Master is enabled however however it carries an uncleared negative effect so the owner must use it with caution y Wu remained UNF instead he felt even more confident another madman just like moss a rampaging Destroyer as for what the side effects are I don't have time to care right now I have already endured debuffs like Shadow King I don't believe there is anything more Dreadful as long as I can blow up this boss that is all that matters the system activated the title Firearms Master transferring the account to the cruel man y Wood's eyes gradually change and he completely transformed into that account his appearance resembling that of a true demon y wo excitedly exclaimed this is so cool I want to unleash a massacre all the demons die for me haha the remaining Starlight was at 0% the protective shield shattered the level 11 Abyssal Mammoth Weevil boss in the dungeon howled I've had enough of your buzzing and annoying sounds die ye W defended with his weapon and laughed loudly I'm not hurt at all add a bit more strength I can take it haha he slashed with the first strike causing the Beast to let out a pain growl g g g his blood was at 90% enraged it shouted what's happening you seem to suddenly have turned into a different person y w smirked with your brain capacity it's hard for me to explain it to you well let me help you improve your Enlightenment he grabbed its claw and directly ignited Ed it making it scream you woo you bastard the blood of the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil is down to 75% he will continue to somersault in the air unleashing powerful shots if improving your Enlightenment still doesn't help you understand then die the creature was not to be underestimated it yelled you humans really underestimate us but if I don't have my ultimate move how can I command millions of the insects the monster roared I am a highlevel race that has evoled for hundreds of years How could an ant like you possibly kill me he unleashed the skills starting berserk the fury of life and the system announced starting berserk the fury of Life increases by 500% two massive beams of light shot out this guy sneered no matter how strong technology is it is merely an external tool only the strength of the body is the ultimate answer look closely at this perfect body of mine so you can see how I Crush what you proudly call technology two black holes opened up directly sucking in every fiber of his being and the system said directly facing the attack of small black holes damn it's a boss and it's hacking Master it doesn't know how to reason Yu was worried it seems that these two attacks from the black holes won't take its life he also realized that his account was about to expire the system announced the host has canceled the account status The Vicious man has restored the basic crazy Moss account status is the system comforted Yu it's not your fault master who would have thought this boss is also a hacker the boss growled disdainful you are the first human to make me look this disheveled do you have any killer moves left if not however his blood was only at 20% the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil arrogantly stated now is the time for your death you who stood before the giant monster calmly contemplating this time I've really run into a strong opponent it seems I need to change my strategy I viz replied seriously Master regardless of the new strategy we must execute it quickly this one has fully powered up Yu was also quite tense I know that its 20% blood is not much but the damage from that life rage is quite Troublesome at that moment the level 11 dungeon boss the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil Unleashed an extremely ruthless move the frenzy State increased its attack power by 300% yiu was surprised did the buff from Life rage disappear it seems attack couldn't last long in that case I can easily kill it in one move by activating the Monarch's nightmare he thought but just killing it like that seems a bit wasteful to maximize the value of the boss I suddenly had a bold idea thinking of this Yi Wu quickly retreated away from the boss the monster noticed and bellowed stop you bastard I will definitely Crush you after using the pursuit technique to keep close to Yu the foolish boss fell into his trap seeing this Yu seized the opportunity and added fuel to the fire I will not stand still for you to kill me come here chase after me if you can catch up I'll let you he turned around flashing a cunning smile signaling that the enemy was about to face disaster then he quickly flew away on the way he was startled to see many insect corpses scattered on the ground mom why are there so many insect Corp ores on the way back to the main base did nana engage in battle with them what is happening didn't I tell Nana to report as if realizing something yiu hurriedly turned back and was stunned to see Nana indeed he saw her lying Motionless in the battlefield which had been severely devastated her body covered in injuries at that moment he heard someone calling Yu's name with worry and urgency Nana wondered who is calling me did I not get killed by the insects how can I hear a voice this voice is so familiar she slowly opened her eyes and saw the happy face of yiu she was shocked as if trying to confirm master master y wo picked Nana up his eyes full of concern as he said so you finally woke up look at yourself why did you let yourself get into this state fortunately your core hasn't been completely destroyed so I can still fix you playing around like this isn't acceptable Nana was surprised she thought she would be scolded perhaps even face a parental style punishment for not completing her tasks but then Yu's gentle smile faded and he became serious it's fine Yu gently said after all NaNa is still a little girl being mischievous is normal moreover before you lost Consciousness you relayed information about the Bas and helped reduce the number of the insects by about 20% he smiled brightly and praised her our Nana did a fantastic job feeling comforted in praised like this Nana was so touched that tears welled up in her eyes this guy I caused trouble but not only does he not blame me he even comforts me gently like this she clutched y Wu's shirt choked up um thank you master on the side of the base everyone was observing the situation Master according to the information relay by the female robot earlier we have locked down the entry point of the insect Invasion and the information about the quantity is being recalculated every one said the results are in the number of the insects left is only 80% before losing the signal from the front line the number of the insects still reached 350% what on Earth happened during this period if there are only 80% left we have a chance to survive that's great sir your deduction was indeed correct that kid named Yu actually did it lii the one referred to as Sir pondered the information just received was was transmitted by Yu's female robot not directly from him now the insects are approaching the base but he still hasn't returned this indicates as he realized something liai turned around and urgently ordered attention everyone even though the insects remaining are only 80% due to the fact that we had previously exhausted all our efforts to support the front Outpost the defense of the main base is still not strong enough do not let your guard down do not waste the desperate efforts of ywu everyone shouted in unison yes immediately the troops entered a state of Readiness for battle the announcement FY all combatants pay attention the insects will reach the base in one minute currently there are two important pieces of news the good news is that the number of the insects has decreased to 80% the bad news is that the defense of the base is still insufficient he said we need the teams to do a good job preparing to welcome the enemy under the high concentration of everyone Li sa announced the insect will arrive at the base in 30 seconds 28 seconds over here Ru and tyen tyan was full of worry the insect is getting close why haven't y Wu and Nana returned yet could they have run into trouble kayak safic calmly replied no y Wu has reduced the number of the insect from 1,000 to 80% they absolutely will not fall at this critical moment Yan Fe y Wu's younger sister offered advice don't think too much right now we must focus on the task at hand we must put all our strength into defending the main base when my brother returns we cannot let his efforts go to waste luu Fang agreed saying Yuni is Right focus on what's in front of us later follow my command I will draw the monster Yuni and kaixi will support and Ruan tyen tyan will be in charge of healing luin reminded our levels aren't high so I will attract low-level monsters so everyone must keep close to my Pace everyone replied in unison understood the countdown moment has arrived the insect has finally approached the base the order has been issued prepare for battle the sound of gunfire immediately rang out in Rapid succession everyone was immersed in the fierce battle a leveled 65 violent Corp rushed towards the base the city Guardian anxiously said this is not good our City walls do not have energy shields for protection and won't hold out for long prioritize shooting at those self-destructing insects suddenly a level 75 Elite monster appeared using a breaking skill that caused the city walls to crumble everyone shouted the main gate has been breached prepare to face the enemy hold the line do not let any of them slip through the level 85 Fang Yun combat team quickly arrived the scene was extremely intense with the battlefield engulfed in flames on one side the four of Kai XI Lu Fang Ruan tan and Y Yun Fe had just defeated a massive level 55 redey crocodile Lu Fang excitedly said that's right this is the Rhythm I didn't expect our first collaboration to be this perfect Ruan T and tan laughed loudly haha let's go next one on the other side ran Jong had just taken down a monster he was a to see apart from The elusive y wo the coordination of these kids at this level can exert incredible combat power he said normally someone with a rank higher than 40 would have long lost their fighting Spirit when facing a desperate battle situation like this but this Royal Warrior team has some real skills he turned to Lu Fang and said hey kid don't get too excited your senior asked me to take care of you so I can't let you cause trouble just follow me and make sure to fight properly this scene was just like a father leading a group of rebellious teenagers luang also listened and replied all right brother ran before he could finish his sentence a light suddenly rushed towards them boom a heavy object fell down leaving both of them stunned in front of them appeared a golden armored mantis Elite of rank 85 its name said it all it seemed that its entire body was covered in Gold Lu Fang was astonished an elite mon monster of rank 85 ranong also panicked and said to Lu Fang run quickly with our levels fighting is no different from seeking death seeing Lu Fang standing still like he was frozen he was shocked what why are you still standing there do you want to die but Lu Fang replied firmly you go ahead and act I will stay back to hold it off and buy time for everyone to escape brother neem please protect my partner determined Brave and somewhat re these are the words that can describe Lu Fang at this moment it seems he has decided to sacrifice himself in an attempt to save his teammates hearing this ran xiong immediately shouted in Anger what Lu Fang don't do anything foolish luang Unleashed his steadfast skill an indomitable defensive skill at level 45 capable of reducing damage by 30% and summoning a four-sided shield to protect against incoming attacks a new monster appeared a golden beast and spoke clearly weak yet still unyielding it seems among your kind there are brave warriors and are you sure there are brave warriors among your kind Lu Fang replied suin remarked H in order to show respect for you I will use all my power to kill you luang shrugged and gave a faint smile to be honest I'm a bit scared of this so-called respect now after saying that he used a shield with four times the power Lu Fang seemingly couldn't withstand it the ground beneath him was shattered and his health dropped to only 20% the powerful strike caused L Fang to groam in pain yet he still stood there gripping The Shield which startled the elite monster what you blocked my full force strike and are still alive you are quite unusual L Fang quickly countered I don't know why either but I won't be easily defeated by you maybe it's just a little oversight but if I get the chance to strike again it would truly be a great Advantage under Lu Fang's slash the monster only lost 5% of its health and the golden armored mantis Elite regained its composure unleashing attack and defense strength that far surpassed its rank forcing L Fain to acknowledge that was indeed an opponent not to be underestimated but that's all it is immediately the golden armored mantis Elite shifted behind him Lu Fang was startled as he couldn't see its movement speed tense he muttered so fast in his mind the image of senior yiwu whom he had always admired appeared he told himself I'm sorry senior I tried my best I didn't lack courage but courage in the face of a disparity and strength is worth nothing I'm still too weak not strong enough to protect you Lu Fang was a person full of loyalty at this moment he might face death but what he feared most was not the death itself but the feeling of guilt towards his comrades he wor worried that his sacrifice wouldn't be enough to help everyone however suddenly with a single move of dragon fist Dance of the prison the golden armored mantis Elite was brought down to 60% Health Lou chain Fang appeared he said the perception of the young lady is indeed not wrong you have exceptional insight and courage these two factors will support you in becoming stronger if you were to die here now it would be a loss for our camp under this technique Lu Fang suddenly restored his health and defense completely reaching 100% while he was still wondering who had come to save him Lu Chang Fang continued we'll handle things here you should quickly regroup with your partners those low-level bugs will rely on you saying this he turned back to command his fang Yun Squad the Fang Yun Squad immediately set up an attack formation Lu Fang was astonished mouth a gape they are the Fang Yun Squad part of the M Night camp that my senior mentioned right no wonder they are an 85 level team the third strongest in the hanmo group this Elite insect won't last long now under the captain's Direction the Fang Yun Squad quickly overwhelmed the monster a voice emerged from the insect H although Humanity has powerful beings like you it truly surprises me to be fair and enjoy this battle shall we have a one-on-one Duel at this moment the insect only had 20% health and 40% defense left yet it still dared to challenge Lu Fang boldly in the end with just a few Swift strikes Lu Chang Fang silenced the monster sending it to meet its ancestors who wants to fight you one-on-one you are just a bug don't even dare to talk about fairness or righteousness here it's a complete waste of time he looked at the team ranking board and saw that the bare combat team was in first place with a level of 88 and had eliminated 304 monsters in second place was the Fang Yun team at level 85 having taken down over 200 monsters it was no surprise that the mo attack team was not present here he thought to himself this time I must strive to accumulate as many points for the team as possible to raise our team's rank after contemplating he shouted loudly all members of the Fang Yun team follow me to continue fighting the enemy we must eliminate all these filthy bugs instantly the spirits of all fenan members soared and they shouted in unison as they charged forward on the other side Lu Fang was facing the wrath of three girls Ru and tyen Ty and said L Fang you can't recklessly charge in like that anymore we are teammates and even if we die we will go with you kakay nodded in agreement that's right yanf didn't oppose as strongly as they did but her eyes were filled with worry she seemed upset and said if something really happens to you and we are still alive my brother will never forgive us Lu Fang was also perplexed and murmured um I understand as a temporary Captain I won't let you all die with me in his heart L Fang silently thanked this announcement hundreds of times if it weren't for it I would surely be scolded further the notification appeared remaining the insect count at 8% the casualty rate in the base at 15% the remaining defense equipment at 30% and the core area undamaged the members participating in the battle jumped with joy great we have won we are alive liai remained calm and said calm down the fight is not over yet be cautious of any unexpected situations also immediately deploy drones to scalp the situation at the forward station everyone scratched their heads and responded in unison yes in truth Liah asai was also confused if yiu really sacrificed himself at the very least they should bring back his body suddenly a warning notification popped up warning warning high energy reaction detected ahead it will reached the base in 60 seconds this plunged everyone into chaos what is happening aren't there only 8% of the insects left why is there still a new wave of insects approaching one person continued who did you think it was turns out it's the chicken being chased by Yu since the beginning of the match at this moment the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil boss had only 20% Health left and its defense had dropped to 18% yiu appeared in front carrying Nana who seemed to be unconscious he quickly flew towards the base causing Liah asai to be so surprised that he swore WTF the boss is in a berserk State and has only 20% he left someone suddenly realized that the one flying in front of the boss was Yu lia's face now clearly showed Pride that's my son everyone around was very surprised he's still alive and has managed to fight the boss to this point truy Y wo the boss's hatred is always tied to Y woo although they were very grateful for what he had done everyone shouted V woo don't come here you'll lead the boss to destroy the base but it seemed Yu didn't care at all seeing Nana smile he realized she had regained Consciousness Yu immediately set Nana down and said go Nana join the meeting with the teammates I still have unfinished business Nana replied okay Master you must be careful yiu smiled confidently don't worry I'll go and come back soon if anyone didn't know they would probably think he was just going out for fun below Ruan tntn and kaii shouted loudly y woo Lu Fang holding Nana in his arms looked at Yi Wu with joy and determination and said don't worry senior in the group perhaps only y yanf remained calm she raised her hand slightly and said softly brother we'll wait for you to come back without hesitation Yu started to think about his plan the defense lines of the base have been sealed off to let the boss through he must aim at a part of the wall and avoid the central area which is the weakest point he quickly accelerated luring the boss close to the wall and slamming into it immediately the wall shattered upon impact watching that scene y Wu assessed this base wall is like a piece of tofu against the boss completely helpless he breathed a sigh of relief thinking to himself luckily I attracted the boss's attention otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable seeing the defensive wall being destroyed everyone shouted in unison aha the defense has been broken before he could finish his sentence someone immediately realized boss is completely ignoring us What on earth does that kid y Wu want to do at this moment only leai remained calm and thoughtful he told himself could it be that Yu is leading boss towards the Huang xen group's base indeed it is like that Yi woo with a face full of joy at The Misfortune of others laughed having deliveries right at your door this early in the year is already rare I genuinely can't wait to see the surprised look on Wang Jen Gru's face when they receive this big gift everyone burst into laughter did you hear that over at hanm group's base the sounds of fighting and cries of Despair are deafening they must be under attack causing chaos ha that's right additionally with sister personally showing up alongside boss this time hanmo group is completely done for just then Ling Yuan appeared from nowhere and asked where is Lulu why hasn't she returned yet I told her to go to the front lines it can't be that she doesn't want to go right this girl is truly too willful making people worry too much everyone was surprised Ling Yuan Sama Ling Yuan appeared worried thinking if something unexpected happens now but deep down he thought this is great haha she has always taken advantage of her high rank and has never listened to anyone before lenan thought if she really causes trouble I will definitely make a scene in the board meeting of the corporation revoke her highlevel dungeon strategy freedom and block her promotion path Hardy stood behind respectfully saying from my understanding of Lady Kulu she must have gone to the Lost Holy Temple alone otherwise she wouldn't have been held back by those pests for so long lay Yuan asked Lulu went to the Lost Temple alone how could that be why would she want to go against the battle plan and act on her own doesn't she know how dangerous that place is Hardy replied this is an unavoidable situation lady Tulu has always been independent unwilling to be bound after all she is too strong upon hearing this Ling Yuan thought to herself that's right precisely because she is too strong she can single-handedly suppress my Pluto combat team preventing us from ever becoming the top fighting force of the Huang Jen group although it's very frustrating there's nothing I can do therefore I must utilize all my capabilities in this Mission Ling yuan's face turned serious as she commanded make them level up quickly no matter how strong she is she can't solo several powerful bosses right and dying would be good our faction can take this opportunity to rise higher Hardy seemed annoyed she said forget it she doesn't follow the rules I can't do anything about her then she asked Hardy how long until we set off to Ambush the hanm group's base Hardy replied immediately in 5 minutes Ling Yuan encouraged everyone get ready we must take advantage of this battle to severely injure the hanmo group bringing our Huang Jen group back into the ranks of the five major Powers everyone here will be rewarded accordingly promoted and given a raise hearing that the group shouted in unison take down the hanmo group take down the hanmo group suddenly a tramer startled the entire group Ling youan asked what happened an earthquake or before she could finish her sentence a subordinate rushed in panicked reporting not good lady Len Yuan there's a winged creature leading a bunch of bosses straight towards our base Hardy grabbed the subordinate by the collar shouting what do you mean a wind creature the bosses were supposed to attack the hanm groot's base why are they charging towards us calm down and explain clearly the trembling subordinate replied I'm not sure I just saw from a distance a kid with wings leading the bosses towards our base then suddenly that kid disappeared Hardy threw him aside angrily thinking could it be that hand Mo's people deliberately brought the boss to our base how could this happen just relying on one person isn't enough he shouted loudly as the boss stormed in chaos get out of here brat the Ling Yuan group gasped it's over the boss really has broken in the boss sneered don't think that just because you're shining I can't do anything to you even if I flatten this place I will find you brat Ling you un panicked run away the boss is not only rampaging but is also going insane if it continues like this our base will truly be trampled he reassured Don't Panic hold your formation the boss's hatred is currently in a chaotic State some of you take the hatred away from it and then wholeheartedly drain the boss's Health we just need 20% more let's resolve this in the shortest time possible the subordinate responded Yes the boss roared furiously are you all with that guy fine kill you and he will naturally appear Hardy commanded others go we must stabilize the boss's hatred for me Yu stood on a building smiling and thinking the biggest gift I've given you all seem very pleased he continued however this time the base of the Huang Jen group has been completely destroyed by the boss restoration is no longer possible we can only recover the boss's health even with only 20% Health remaining it is enough to significantly reduce your members this way you will no longer have the will or the strength to raid the hanmo group's base this is what is called losing a chicken and not gaining a grain of rice he thought to himself at first I hesitated if Sulu was at the base she could handle the boss with just a few moves my operation this time would mean nothing fortunately I made the right bet now even if the boss is Health drops below 5% I will still carry out the final step of the operation plan the boss increasingly angered by the attacks shouted get lost you annoying pests Hardy said Well Done keep attacking the boss's health is down to 6% we have hope for victory now he laughed thinking the people from the HM group want to use the boss's power to destroy us but they made a fatal Mistake by allowing the boss's Health to drop this love this is no different from giving us a huge gift although they have also lost quite a few people compared to the loot from the boss these losses are negligible he thought this big gift we are happy to accept hemp everyone was surprised what the heck what is happening outside the base what is that red electric beam they saw a pool of red liquid on the ground what is that someone exclaimed moreover that stuff is quickly approaching this bright red blood Could It Be Blood it's not just ordinary blood it seems like a kind of solid liquid that has its own Consciousness this thing is too bizarre get away quickly don't touch these strange things one person warned even the boss was taken back exclaiming what kind of trick is this a little bit of water can disturb me what is this at this moment the boss red in pain shouting despicable humans daring to use such Insidious tricks against me the master here will kill you kill them all the growling made everyone shudder Hardy shouted loudly not good someone is trying to steal a boss in the middle of the fight everyone Focus your Firearms shoot accurately Ling Yuan said that's right use all our strength the boss's health is only at 3% left this is the result of our hard work we absolutely cannot let others steal it away the group responded in unison but the more they ATT attacked the boss not only did not weaken but became even stronger Ling Yuan and the others were panicked how can this be possible the boss said our fire attack was absorbed completely how strong is this Eerie blood wall Shield after a fierce attack everything sank into red rumbling and gurgling the group thought they were finished it's over but they die everything we put in so far will be in vain damn it Hardy cursed damn it one of the cordinates angrily exclaimed who was it who took our boss go find it for me dig three feet into the ground to find that person for me the subordinate replied yes suddenly the giant hand of the boss appeared pointing at the group of subordinates one of them wondered isn't this the giant hand condensed from the blood wall is this a warning to us is it telling us not to act rashly or we will die after being attacked the group quickly created Shields Ling Yuan said try to endure everyone stand still and don't act recklessly the opponent's moves are too powerful and Eerie we can't risk our bodies the boss has been taken that's already done but we have a more important mission to complete don't lose the big picture over something small L Yuan angrily thought to himself damn it I originally intended to play caman Mo group but they didn't expect to be bitten back shulu was all because I left my position this debt must be counted on me the system voice sounded 30 seconds countdown ends the fusion of the account Shadow King is about to be dissolved this battle has consumed 30 seconds and 30 million has been deducted from the owner's account the owner enters the state of shattered Soul maintaining for 60 seconds Yu smirked thinking indeed the buff effect of shattered soul is still active but 60 seconds is brief and manageable it seems that upgrading my account to the chaien emperor has helped increase the basic attributes but the pain sensation remains unchanged luckily in the end I was able to pose enough of a threat that they didn't dare take the risk ywu continued his thoughts now I must make use of this 60 seconds to see what good items the boss might drop system announcement congratulations to the owner for receiving a reward of 10 million1 million experience points for defeating the boss the following items were obtained Big Horn of the Abyssal Mammoth Abyssal Shield Thunder tramples is this all that dropped then spending 30 million to use Shadow K was quite a lost I can only console myself that at least I disrupted Wong xen group's scheme the system continued to announce congratulations to the owner for completing the special event of the Epic Level and achieving the performance of easy defense hard offense the system reported Solo or I solo an entire branch of your army or one branch of your army solo follows me and rewards after the special epic event are 80 million 8 million experience points and five level 100 treasure mirrors y wo unexpectedly exclaimed damn it turns out the real reward at the back is to kill the boss to be considered as completing this special epic event right he laughed recalling his earlier comment killing so many the insects but not dropping any equipment or experience points turns out it's all about the final accounting after all all according to the rules submitting half to the corporation I can still make a decent amount now all he had to do was wait for the event to end and then returned to the base to gather with Yun FEI and the others everyone was thrilled to see the boss defeated it's over one person said but thinking back to just now when I saw the boss charging at us I nearly wet my pants someone else said absolutely absolutely good thing I brought an extra pair of pants stop chatting and let's get to work understood came the reply liai thought for a moment and then asked has the number of the insects decreased now this meant that the boss had been killed but who was the one who killed it you must know about it right if not it wouldn't have been so easy to hand the boss over to the Wong Jen group like that liess I thought y Wu is really not simple in this life I have met countless people but I have never encountered anyone like him Yu landed on the ground and asked is everyone okay y Yan FEI and the girls rushed over to hug him joyfully saying you're finally back Kai looked at him worried saying you look tired are you okay y wo Ruan tan Tian smiled don't worry I will help you shake off your fatigue y wo replied all right all right can you let me go with three people hugging me like this I feel even more uncomfortable Lu Fang stood nearby and called out senior congratulations on your successful return yiu nodded and replied yeah Li GFI came over and said why woo you've saved the whole base everyone owes you a favor and I owe you even more y wo Von hearing this gently replied don't say that Master lie ji everyone fought for the same purpose no one owes anyone anything he continued ah I previously killed the boss and received the reward for the special event the insect attack this time according to the corporation's regulations I have to submit half of the reward so who should I give it to L Fang standing by admired him and thought as expected of the senior he really knows how to seize the opportunity first humility then skillfully bringing up the issue of the reward suddenly an old man appeared and said there's no need to submit everything belongs to you no matter how many benefits you receive it can never compare to your contrib butions you saved my life as a board member of the corporation I have the full authority to make decisions on behalf of the corporation yiu was taken aback and asked is this for real the old man continued are you interested in being my personal bodyguard Yu the price is entirely up to you to decide Yu broke out in a sweat and replied no I'm quite busy I don't have the time the system reported Captain by Wang Ming of the Moa attack team is calling via video from the front lines we Schuman said so the communication line has been restored it seems you all successfully defended against the insect attack lii replied that's right although the losses were severe we at least held our ground and it was all thanks to yiwu's efforts yiu said no it was the hard work of everyone without the resource support from the rear I wouldn't have been able to do it Juan Hal appeared along with Wang Chuan happily saying haha great job Yu I knew you could do it Wang Chu interjected it's still too early to celebrate although we've dealt with the problem of the insect attack a new hassle has already emerged he continued this hassle from the perspective of the mission frustrates me even more than the offensive from the insect at this moment outside the Holy Temple Wang Chun was observing the situation and reported although we have thoroughly dealt with all the insects outside the Holy Temple we have encountered a difficult problem our Siege weapons cannot breach the large door of the Holy Temple this is the last Cannon Among The Siege artillery we have but unsurprisingly the result is the same as the previous 29 attacks the large door remains blocked and automatically restores itself the Holy Temple seems to possess a life of its own with extremely powerful defensive and self-healing capabilities completely beyond our comprehension the reason is that this is the first time we have come into close contact with the the Holy Temple we do not understand its characteristics well which leads to our underestimation of its defensive abilities upon hearing the report Yu secretly sighed this Holy Temple is indeed very powerful with defensive properties coupled with self-healing surpassing the shield walls I modified before in terms of Marvels at that moment another insect shot poison into wine chuan's group and mocked damn it humans have said so many times already that toy of yours is useless if you want to break through the large door of our Holy Temple you need to change your name change to something bigger ha otherwise just stop bothering us other than being a game for us it serves no purpose at all Wang Chun created a protective shield then calmly continued although we say that we are doing our utmost it is still possible to circumvent the main gate to forcefully breach the entrance however due to several battles with bosses afterwards we must conserve our strength and Equipment Therefore your task now is to bring stronger Siege weapons to the front lines to assist in breaking down the main gate at the Holy Temple lii listened and replied seriously but the siege weapons you brought are already the strongest Siege weapons of our handm Mo group even if we can compensate for the lack of firearms with numbers the base has just gone through Fierce battles resources have been exhausted and fundamentally we have no capacity to produce additional weapons Wang Chun responded I don't care about the process only the results no matter what method you use you must deliver the required quantity of firearms to me with the stipulated time if not everyone in the base will be punished why Chuan turned to liai and continued and Li ji you are the top expert in construction robbery of the group you were the one primarily responsible you must be very clear about the consequences after a moment someone angrily said damn it this bynea is clearly trying to make things difficult for us one person retorted hey hey don't you guys need the Network anymore how can you dare to blame by wine J someone else responded we just went through a fierce battle in such a short time it's basically impossible to meet his demands Yu also realized the seriousness of the situation and figured that b Wang J was indeed a cold and domineering figure not showing any Mercy even to his own people he approached L ji and asked Master have you thought of a solution Li GSI replied the current situation has exceeded my expectations for now we can only speed up the resource collection and do our best to manufacture more Siege weapons Yu felt worried as time might not be enough but before he could finish his thought liai spoke up since things have come to this point it no longer pertains to my position as the master of engineering we cannot let the dungeon mission fail after all everyone has gone through life and death to reach this stage we absolutely cannot give up halfway you who couldn't help but feel admiration secretly thinking I didn't expect li jaai who looks Stern and unapproachable could have the vision of a commander like that he smiled and said to him if there really is no other way I happen to have a rather bold idea he stammered saying think big Lu Fang suddenly interrupted get out of the way get out of the way my senior must be saying this just to show off Juan how questioned Wong Chuan senior are you being too strict because within the given time frame Liah sa basically cannot complete the task as you require wne chuman replied sternly do you think I don't know the current situation I am well aware of lie just as abilities he definitely cannot fulfill my request Juan how interrupted I understand on the surface you were demanding from like ji but in reality you were telling Yu this intending to to use this matter to probe yiwu's true strength Wang Chun thought for a moment then realized that if he directly pressured ywu he might become discouraged and hide himself the only way is to force him to connect his interests with Collective emotions in order to draw out his true strength earlier when shaking hands Wang Chuan had attempted to use his probing ability to test guu strength but sensed a blockage from an unknown Force at that moment we Chun felt as if he was standing in the Universe small and lonely although was just a fleeting illusion it was enough to prove that y wo harbored a great secret within him Juan Hal said to him so it turns out that even our high-ranking senior has a three-part hesitation towards y wo it seems I really didn't misjudge this kid y woo haha however no matter how much we Clash at least our external stance Remains the Same so what we need to focus on now he continued is the sister of the Hang Jen group who is always been said to be watching the drama from behind he added hey that beautiful level 140 girl from the ju Jen group don't just stand there watching the show Why Don't We join forces to break through this citygate Sulu replied mully haha aren't you guys known as the strongest Mo attack team of the hanm group is this really all you can do she continued this play is so boring that I feel like falling asleep Juan how angrily yelled hey don't think you can act all high and mighty just because you're at a higher level if you're so good come over here the six of us aren't afraid of you alone seeing that the situation was not good yum sha quickly intervened Brother Juan how don't act rashly the legendary woman who solo clears level hundred dungeons we shouldn't provoke her wangchu added don't cause trouble completing the mission according to the set goals is the most important thing Juan how added but leaving a Potential Threat behind is really bothersome what if she stabs Us in the back Wang Chu explained her bold appearance shows that she doesn't take us seriously but she hasn't openly attacked us which indicates that she can't break through the main gate of the Holy Temple by herself only when we break through the main gate of the Holy Temple will it be the official confrontation with her he thought further right now I'm just curious to see how you will solve the difficult problem I assigned to him just then a Tremor occurred causing Wan how to worry what's happening the ground is shaking again could it be that the insect is preparing for a large scale attack Yuma replied it can't be the last attack depleted all the resources and troops of the insect they can't recover that quickly suddenly a soldier shouted captain in the distance the ground is being flattened and a large number of unidentified objects are heading this way they will reach the battlefield in about 60 seconds onean how quickly asked a large number of unidentified objects could it be the insect Wang chuman speculated it's not the insect that direction is towards the base Juan how could it be y wo he appeared and spoke everyone has been waiting for a long time I'm bringing supplies for you all here Juan how wondered what is that you brought along oh just kidding there are so many improved mining machines what on Earth does y Wu want to do Yi Wu replied calmly it's very simple I want to move the entire main base and Firearms right in front of the insect's Nest to intimidate them everyone was astonished and began to discuss that kit wants to bring the main base right to the insects Lair this is completely unconventional I've never seen such a reckless action is that even possible while flying y Wu explained as long as the resource extraction speed keeps up it'll be fine I've upgraded all the mining machines from the main base hearing this Juan how laughed and joyfully said ha no wonder you're y woo in short you always surprise me whatever you do I'm on your side young sha glanced over and chuckled lightly this sort of suicidal Behavior won't succeed moreover it would be a waste of time and resources but if you want to bring disaster upon yourself then at least it saves me from having to take action a member of the Special Forces spoke up that kid actually brought brought so many mining machines seems like he has guts daring to think and act I think who knows maybe I can work with him another member chimed in work with him a guy like you your brain must be made of iron too the whole group burst into laughter their voices echoing throughout the Bas can this type of strategy succeed wine Chuan thought he then said to himself how dare they engage in such Reckless Behavior are they trying to cause more trouble or do they have a problem with their brains he said you arrived earlier than I expected but where is The Siege weapon I wanted Li GSI is the top Construction Master of the group yet he dares to let a kid run a mock at such a critical moment ymu confidently replied everyone rest assured my plan will definitely not fail liai also spoke with confidence I trust my judgment and will take responsibility for that decision now you just need to let y Wu act freely Juan how asked again so y Wu what is your specific plan Yi Wu calmly explained first according to my judgment instead of pushing for resource extraction at the poor mineral mine at the main base we should relocate the base to the front line that place has never been deeply explored and it surely hides a large amount of magic Crystal ore likely of a high grade furthermore based on previous observations the mo attack team has almost cleared this area so safety is guaranteed finally we can utilize the modified mining machines behind to quickly stockpile resources and mass-produce Siege weapons with stronger Firearms young sha angrily pointed at y Wu and said all of this is just your assumption how do you know there will be a large amount of high-grade ormin Mines here you are a reckless Gambler not considering the consequences yet you want us to Bear the burden for you Yi Wu calmly replied although there is a bit of Reckless gambling no one understands the distribution rules of magic crystals better than I do to as for mining I am an expert at that moment I visz appeared and said Master just as you predicted recently there have indeed been a lot of magic Crystal or mines appearing and they are all highgrade around level 100 Yun was taken aback exclaiming what how can this be possible Lu Fang smugly said why can't it be this is the truth looks like you've been slapped in the face huh he said with just you do you dare to question our senior yiu spoke up the situation cannot be delayed everyone follow the orders use maximum power to transport the minerals out and within the shortest time stockpile resources to the utmost for me lii added we will also immediately begin constructing the base and resource transmission station abandoning defensive projects with the main fire power shifted to the units the guard Brigade responded in unison Yes master y Wu turn to Wang Chuan don't worry we will definitely complete the mission within the deadline you set Wang Chuan replied yes on the outside everyone looks fine but I hope the final outcome won't disappoint me Juan how shouted in confusion when he saw yimu step into the battlefield hey what do you want to do hurry back here if you go any further you will enter the area covered by the defensive fire of the Holy Temple those corrosive acid Solutions are no joke yiu casually replied don't worry brother how I'm just standing outside to take a look not going in a monster reported to its teammates another low-level human spin him out for me yiu easily countered with his skills he said don't be nervous I'm really just here to take a look he thought to himself at first I felt that the defensive and self-repairing abilities of the Holy Temple were very strange now that I'm closer I can be sure that this Holy Temple absolutely has life although I can't clearly determine what it is based on the characteristics of insects the subject is likely to mostly grow underground he turned to a vis and asked do I have a map of the underground probing weapon in my hand I Vis replied yes it is a drill shaped probe device used to explore underground that Li asai provided earlier this device can recreate some additional functions to explore the underground area of the Holy Temple Yi Wu immediately ordered then seize the opportunity to modify it I Vis continued understood Master there is one more thing I haven't had the chance to report to you since we started entering this dungeon I have spent a lot of time scanning and conducting a preliminary assessment of the entire dungeon and I found that it has reached a five-star level of development Yu was surprised and said five stars I didn't expect the danger adaptability of the entire team to reach the maximum the tropical rainforest dungeon with its beautiful scenery only reached three stars before I this further explained the reasons regarding this the AI thought for a moment and then answered its Master the advantages of this dungeon have three main points first the area of the dungeon is large enough but the terrain is quite uneven and unclear many Flatlands are suitable for large scale mining second the climate is stable and the temperature is Pleasant with very few major natural dis occurring third and most importantly high-grade magic crystals are abundant here sufficient to meet the needs of construction projects however the AI also pointed out some disadvantages first the number of insects in the dungeon is extremely high besides insects concentrated in the center of the Holy Temple there are also many wild monsters scattered everywhere second gaining control over the dungeon is a very challenging task two large corporations are competing so so if the master wants to claim it for himself it is almost impossible yiu smiled in response no worries just set the goals high as long as the five-star adaptability standard remains unchanged who knows we might achieve it the underground wave probing device had been completed Juan was surprised when he saw Yu's product and said did you create another new toy what is this used for lii replied this is a probe to explore the or mine that I mentioned to you earlier right he said but you have already carried out the transformation could it be that you are preparing to use it to explore the underground of the Holy Temple he replied that's right this Holy Temple is very eerie although the specific situation inside cannot be clarified at least we need to understand the entire area outside that can be explored Juan how cheerfully said to him I didn't expect you to look Reckless but in fact you are quite cautious not bad not bad haha he awkwardly responded um I am originally very cautious did I Really Leave such a poor impression on you at the same time the underground exploration device began to transmit data simulating it into a three-dimensional spatial image the amplification progress reached 40% 60% 80% and finally 100% the exterior of the Lost Holy Temple was fully simulated yiu was surprised when he received the simulation ated image he said the shape of this lost Holy Temple is indeed a gigantic insect this is too exaggerated completely Beyond Comprehension and what is that red substance in the center it feels like it is supplying energy to this gigantic insect Juan ha said so does that mean we have to enter its body to fight the booss just thinking about it makes me feel nauseous Wang Chu and said seriously this is not something that should be considered right now the most important issue at the moment is that if we cannot sever the connection between this energy core and the Holy Temple then perhaps the Holy Temple will continuously restore itself essentially we cannot break through its layers of defense this is truly a major headache yiwu thought to himself no this energy core actually presents an enormous opportunity for me is it possible for this dungeon to reach a five-star adaptation is the key reason the existence of this energy core jiwang Chun looked at Le just s Fring as he said lii think of a way to sever the link between the Holy Temple and the energy Corp lii merely smiled and replied sorry with the current technology and Equipment of our Corporation breaking down the large Gates of the Holy Temple is already the limit we have absolutely no hope of destroying the underground main link giwan Chuan turned to look at y wo and asked what about you do you have any key tricks if you were able to uncover covered the secrets beneath the Holy Temple you must have a follow-up plan right yeu did not look at him only smiled and said you think too highly of me this Holy Temple has an unclear level but it certainly must be at least level 200 or higher what can I possibly do ji wangchu and heard him say that not bothering to look at Yu anymore and showed an arrogant demeanor it seems I have overestimated you forget it then focus on breaking through the main gate however you're time is running out if you can't do it I'm sure you understand the seriousness of the consequences Yi Wu smirked and replied calmly I know in his heart he secretly mocked could you ease up on the pressure a bit if you really want to mess with me do it quietly this public way of making things difficult seems a bit superficial I Vis anry said what is this if you're so capable then you do it besides based on the Master's abilities as long as a large amount of resource are spent to create a powerful bomb and place it underground it could detonate the energy core cutting off the connection with the Holy Temple seeing I Vis getting angry yiu smiled and tried to sooe calm down a bit I Vis if we detonate the energy core the entire dungeon might explode not to mention that we ourselves cannot take the initiative to do so I will also prevent anyone foolish enough to touch the energy core that is an important energy source in my five-star critical point a treasure that needs to be cherished yeu looked at Le ji and offered his opinion Master although the main gate of the Holy Temple has the potential to regenerate from my observations its recovery process requires time if we use our strongest Firepower to attack it surely won't have enough time to recover liai stared ahead looking a bit concerned yes this is the only way but is our Firepower strong enough yiu smiled confidently and replied not enough we must make it enough the captain has ordered that no matter what I will not let our previous efforts go to waste and I cannot let you lose your Peak Master hearing that he laughed heartily narrowing his eyes thank you Yu continued but speaking of your peak in the field of construction science I think you are much more suited than I am Li aside put his arm around Yu's shoulders looked straight into his eyes and said seriously I'm not joking Yu since I started interacting with you I've come to realize my shortcomings in terms of capability I am fundamentally unable to compare with you yiu felt a bit awkward and humbly responded no no no you praise me too much although I have some intelligence and a few tricks in terms of experience and lived knowledge I am completely unable to compare with you y Wu understood clearly in his heart sitting in this position only makes me a Target instead I think it is better to help lie jock Sai m maintain his status this way my own benefits can reach the highest level he looked towards the woman named suu who was comfortably seated in a large chair far away there's one more thing that needs to be dealt with yiu quickly spread his Wide Wings turned his head to speak to Li ji everyone continue to push forward the construction progress I'll go deal with the threat behind there Juan how upon hearing this anxiously said wait a minute ye woo what are you planning to do don't go provoking that woman he stepped up to hold Yu back Wang Jan's woman is not someone you can handle our team leader despite being strong doesn't dare to provoke her when I joked with her earlier it was just an act if you truly anger her Yu interrupted don't worry brother how I've interacted with her a few times and I know how formidable she is I'm just going over to talk I'll be back soon with that y wo quickly flew away ignoring onean House's calls from behind vwo you absolutely mustn't act rashly ji Wang Chu and looked at guwu feeling resentful in his heart what Reckless Behavior so what if you can kill a level 90 boss that woman is at level 140 and a kid like you daring to challenge her deserves to be killed yiu landed where Kulu was sitting and smiled saying susulu young lady you really have a taste for the Arts watching the whole time without making a move don't you find it boring Sulu glanced at her hands and smiled slightly it is indeed boring but seeing you here Has Lifted my spirits the fact that you survived the previous boss truly surprises me she propped her chin on her hand and looked at y woo what I'm more curious about is how you managed to break through the Great Gate of the Holy Temple a place even the Mong group could not breach Yu looked at her and calmly replied I didn't expect suu young lady to think so highly of me however you probably won't have the chance to see how I broke through the gate because your Huang Jang base needs to be rebuilt after being wrecked by the boss as the top combat power aren't you going to return and help out Sulu was startled by his words and asked what the base was destroyed by the boss she quickly opened the system screen to check the information you must know the consequences of deceiving me inside Sulu was panic-stricken thinking when acting a she often shuts off communication devices but why is the base being attacked by the boss isn't there still a way to the base of hanmo as the system booted up a series of messages were sent continuously thulu where are you now hurry back to me the base has been breached reminder the base is being attacked by the boss warning the base has been destroyed by the boss suu exclaimed in shock a raid she quickly pressed her sword against Yu's neck gritting her teeth and asking is this all you're doing Yu sweated when he felt the sharp blade against his throat in his mind he thought when the sword is only 0.01 CM from my throat I decided to stop pretending and use chainless lies even if full of holes to deceive her he faint helplessness and said don't be impulsive Sulu young lady I don't have the ability to Ambush you like that I just couldn't fight against that boss so I wanted to lead it back to the base I didn't expect hanm Mo's base to be trampled to ruins by the boss and the remaining people had to struggle to escape after destroying hanm Mo's base the boss headed straight for yor Huang Jang base ksun L said nothing quickly mounted her sword and flew away exuding an aura of killing intent although I don't believe your words I will temporarily spare your life but remember this if you truly are the one responsible for this she glanced at Yu with a gaze full of killing intent curling her lips into a smile no matter how far you try to hide I will find you and make your death very ugly yiu was terrified beads of sweat forming on his forehead silently thinking Heavens that expression doesn't look like she joking is she really coming for me being targeted by a level 140 girl is definitely no joke it's best to take it one step at a time if it really comes down to it I'll just burn everything I own and fight with the Shadow King Juan how saw Yi Wu return and hurried over to asked vwo you did well what did you say to her that made her leave so quickly after just a few words but when he looked closely Juan Hal noticed that something was off with Yu's face and asked further what's wrong with your complexion you look terrible seeing his friend's concern yiu scratched his head and laughed awkwardly I'm I'm fine the trouble has been dealt with now it's time to put all my effort into recreating the attacking weapons ji Wang Chun looked at Yu's safely return and was so angry that he gritted his teeth oh my God it's true Zulu really left this kid aside from having a slightly pale face is completely fine why did he make the whole team worry like that 2 hours later everyone cheered excitedly we finally did it the heavy Firepower equipment version has been upgraded we have truly surpassed the insect faction in terms of attack power this is just too exhilarating isn't it looking at the large robot equipped with many heavy weapons ready for battle the whole team became even more excited those damn bugs the last attack caused us a lot of suffering this time we must make them taste the heavy Firepower shooting back at them Li ji still felt worried and stared at it even though the weapon levels have been significantly upgraded can we really destroy the large door that has the ability to regenerate of the Holy Temple Yu replied cheerfully of course it's not enough that's why we need to add this weapon too he presented another large weapon Rampage Slayer everyone gassed is this the new heavy Siege weapon it's just too powerful looking at it everyone can feel the full beauty of violence AI Vis chimed in as a reminder Master although this Siege weapon has been modified it still requires time to charge the longer the charging time the greater the attack power y will looked at it and replied no why let recharge use other Firepower to defend first Yu stood in front of the large robot and commanded go start attacking a large Beast appeared with a long trunk extending out its Trump resembling a machine gun that could fire bullets continuously below it there were three other large heads everyone was astonished by the scene before them the insect side also set up a line of fiery defense the creature resembling artillery firing far away looking truly Eerie however our Firepower deployment was out of their firing range Yu sneered they are wasting their efforts on the other side a large insect leading the Swarm contemptuously said foolish humans do you think you are the only ones who know how to arrange Firepower let me show you the new technology of our insects haha liai looked at them his brows furrowing slightly in worry have the insects evolved a new defensive Force if they are given a little more time won't they be able to organize into a large scale insect formation the talent of the insects is truly terrifying Yu also looked towards the insects and replied the problem is not big we fire at them to prevent them from having time to mature in his heart he felt excited as he thought in the end is the recovery speed of the Holy Temple faster or is my Firepower stronger soon I will be able to see clearly Yu looked at w chuan's back and said Captain the rear Firepower has been completely arranged you can give the order to attack at any time gwan Chuan simply replied A he stood still closed his eyes and focused his thoughts to think that he could really arrange all the Firepower within the set time limit ywu truly makes people see him in a new light but does he have real strength or is he just a performer the results will verify that thinking this ji wangchu would quickly ordered to fight waving his hand and shouting loudly blow this big door apart for me the robot continuously fired shells at the insects boom boom boom the Firepower bombarded 10 times stronger boom he gritted his teeth and said if you only use the insects 10 times over to Ambush us then I will return your Firepower with 10 times the bombardment so you won't have time to recover the guns kept firing without stopping on the insect side the recovery speed also increased tfold a person quickly reported the situation Master the recovery speed of the walls and the big door of the Holy Temple has increased significantly but our pill resources have already dropped to 85% liai calmly replied don't worry about its recovery speed and the amount of pills keep shooting for me ywu saw the large bug trying to absorb all the energy from the Red Orb to quickly recover feeling Furious the Holy Temple is accelerating the absorption of the energy core those damn bugs don't suck all my energy core leave a little for me the insect counterattacked continuously firing shots one person in the group commented your Firepower is indeed stronger than before but it still has no effect now it's our turn to Counterattack the bullets from the insect continued to fall but the falling speed was slower than the firing speed from y Wu side seeing this everyone joyfully said haha the insect is still bombing our firing range is farther than yours you basically can't hit us laughter echoed as the ground shook with hundreds of thousands of bugs squiring into a large wheel charging forward the self- explosive beetles had gathered in scale creating an extremely Fierce attack witnessing this scene everyone was astonished one person exclaimed this is basically not a bomb at all but the self- explosive Beatles are rushing into to attack the number is too terrifying everyone anxiously asked Master should we allocate some Firepower for defense if we let the self- explosive beetles get close our losses will be devastating Liah aside turned to Y Wu and asked vwu what do you think Yu looked at the swarm of insects in front of them and calmly replied there's no need to split up continue firing with all your strength I have my own way to deal with those self- exploding insects at that moment a series of spiky balls resembling small spiders broke through the ground they were densely packed self- exploding spider mines yeu remained unperturbed as he said because I have experience with self- exploding tactics those spiders are attacking the defense line of a self- exploding Beetle swarm their strategy is to sacrifice individual attacks to create overwhelming pressure and numbers it truly is a nightmare for anyone with a fear of clusters of holes a loud explosion rang out everyone was both astonished and worried the self- exploding beetles have been decimated Yu you're really skilled however they still anxiously looked up at the sky as they saw a new wave of insect armor approaching seemingly never ending the self- exploding beetles are coming again it really doesn't stop someone asked vwoo do you have enough spider mines ywu stuck his hands in his pockets and calmly answered of course it's not enough everyone was horrified and turned to look at him what Yu asked ad a this how long until our attacking force is fully charged the robot quickly replied it has reached 98% and it will take 5 more minutes to reach 100% energy y w spoke up I can't wait any longer I don't want to exhaust too much in this match with that he waved his hand to command his new robot to fire everyone looked in amazement at this robot its attacking weapon is too powerful not only does it have extremely high attack power but it also is not afraid of the corrosion acid from self- explosive beels its arms are like Spike chains coiling tightly wherever they swing they crush the insects underneath Yu watched the scene of his robot attacking the insects filled with excitement this is a modified product made from a horn of a previous boss enabling the robot to be completely immune to the corrosive acid of the insects go kill everything in your path for me ye whooo shouted enthusiastically the insects were being struck and cried out in despair chit chit chit chit everyone noticed two deadly spikes from yiwu's new weapon crawling up the city wall making people gossip these insects climbed the city wall Very nimbly and even skillfully dodged the waves of Firepower finally they began to launch an attack towards the large door of the Holy Temple the large door slowly appeared with two large spikes swirling around the front the main gate of the the Lost Holy Temple level unknown defense index 30% life index 100% everyone was astonished when they saw them and the station merged together what are they trying to do here as the two things combin into one an infernal me grinder instantly appeared the extremely powerful attack made everyone exclaim in astonishment is there such a fusion operation the information system displayed the main gate of the Lost Holy Temple unknown level def defense index 10% Health index 100% looking at their appearance and strength after Fusion everyone was dumbfounded even a little terrified one person said damn it this is too extravagant thankfully ywu is not their enemy otherwise it's unimaginable I can't believe I dared to provoke him before now thinking back it's frightening G1 Chun frowned slightly when he saw this scene he thought this kid's engineering skills are in impressive no wonder Li just Sai has to bow down and call him a God but I still need to verify what his actual strength is it must be checked further Yi Wu stare at them telling himself no the attack power is still insufficient in the end it's still lacking a tiny bit it seems that only charging 98% of the energy does not achieve perfect attack status there is only one last way left on the system screen a notification appeared the main gay of the the Lost Holy Temple level unknown Shield index 8% life index 100% Yi Wu quickly reached out towards Li jasai saying Master immediately use all Firepower to shoot allocate all resources to the bright bombardment then aim precisely at the hbe grinder to shoot lii nodded replying understood all Firepower is being directed at the hel meet grinder the bright bombardment is firing at maximum capacity the system emitted a warning sound warning warning resource consumption is too fast only 15% remaining the hell meat grinder was swirling madly remaining resources 10% 5% Yu stared at the screen saying the thrust of the bright bombardment will increase the attack power of the hell meat grinder before the resources run out break through the main gate of the Holy Temple in one go the system continued to announce the main gate of the Lost Holy Temple level unknown Shield index 0% life index 80% a loud explosion rang out the system announced the main gate of the Lost Holy Temple level unknown Shield index 0% life index 0% everyone joyfully cheered finally we have broken through the main gate of the Holy Temple amazing at this moment a strong purple light emerged from within piercing through the hellish meat grind everyone exclaimed in panic what is happening the hellish Meek grinder was struck by the light that burst from within the Holy Temple had been destroyed the system announced that the hellish Meek grinder was at level 100 with only 2% Health remaining and the life index was at 0% the light shot towards Yu's group at an extremely fast speed ji Wang Chu quickly created a formation to Shield them everyone was anxious and wondered what is happening are we being attacked Yu stared at the large door clearly seeing the light from within piercing through his hellish Meek grinder the distance from the moment the light burst forth to when it reached their group was only about 0.5 seconds Yi Wu turned to look at the man standing in front of the large door thinking my strength is still far inferior to gwan Chuan not confronting him directly is the correct Choice ji Wang Chuan sheathed his sword and calmly said this is Trivial no need to be afraid he walked past y Wu looked over and said liwo you did very well you did not disappoint me your task in this dungeon is now complete next leave it to our Mong group you all just need to stay in place and wait for orders ye W nodded ah a the people around buzzed with discussion was it finally time to carry out the final infiltration battle Captain G Wang Chuan Valiant and mighty led the way while the Mong group prepared to advance Juan how was excited starting to warm up his joints as he followed jiwang chuan's group he looked at y woo and shouted wait for my good news ye woo watch me crush this the Lost Holy Temple the man beside him scoffed don't be so loud I will record the entire battle later you will have to hold back your nausea don't mess up the footage Juan how was Furious and shouted who's going to puke he Wu just smiled at them he thought to himself aren't they trying to clarify my intentions or are they just telling me to stay and wait for orders to prepare to give up or to worry that I might snatch the boss although ji Wang Chu was very powerful it was clear he was also very cautious just then from a distance a swarm of insects rushed out led by a beast an Ant-Man level 85 who shouted angrily foolish humans I have tolerated you for too long and yet you d to break the great door of my Holy Temple I will tear you apart beside the anman was an elite Beast explosive Beetle level 90 who coldly said what's the point of wasting words on them just kill them and be done both charged forward shouting die but before they could reach jiwang Chuan they were sent flying back by the shield in front of him jiwang chuan's Echo Shield had blocked and repelled their attack maintaining for 3 seconds The Shield Dome began firing back back at the beasts catching them off guard what's happening our attacks are being fired back Juan how exclaimed excitedly you foolish pests don't underestimate the power of our sister Lulu at this moment Lulu was using formation books while the buff team was still in a state of preparation the system announced the Furious Roar of the Dragon Slayer added attack power the soul of latata added speed the blessing of the Angel added life force courage added spell attack and soul element added various attributes the insects were quickly exterminated Juan how enthusiastically said great job Lulu with this buff of yours I feel stronger and can last longer Lulu silently smiled but beads of sweat were starting to form on her forehead as she watched her teammates fighting against the beasts Dark Knight Thunder step with Ambush s yum shell swiftly eliminated each Beast he added lasting long isn't important speed is key with Lulu's strength supporting me I can handle two level 80 Elite monsters at the same time as he spoke he stabbed two large bugs to death breaking through the Enemy Lines the bald man standing behind clasped his hands and Unleashed his ultimate move six armed deity Buddha a powerful wave of energy burst forth shaking the space the ground cracked and the swarm of insects was completely wiped out ji Wang Chuan calmly said but his words were filled with sarcasm is this all you insects are capable of no wonder you dare only hide in your nests drawing your courage from your army when you march out but don't dare to show yourselves if not then get lost and don't block my way the large Beast Shasta at level 115 raised a gigantic orb and quickly shot it towards him damn it stop being so smug don't think that just because you humans broke through the great door of the Holy Temple you can pass through my door I will not you to survive you are not worthy of the kingk trust G Wang Chuan gently deflected the light emitted from the orb with his sword the king huh this is new information at that moment a large Beast unexpectedly appeared from behind intending to Ambush him however as soon as it got close the Beast was detected and immediately eliminated ji Wang Chuan sheathed his sword and calmly asked who is the king is he very powerful is he the brain warm that controls all you insects chaste yelled in Anger how dare you mention the brain warm all you humans are lowly creatures get out of here our insect race is a higher lineage than humans you are simply not comparable to us as it spoke it withdrew its tendrils deeply embedded in the ground to connect its power gwang Chuan observed this and pondered is it linking with the Holy Temple directly absorbing energy from the energy core beneath the Earth sasta aimed the muzzle of his gun at g w Chuan and said cheerfully if you want to know I can tell you but only after you die g w Chun looked at sasta with disdain and replied you have quite a sharp tongue huh on the other side Lia quietly watched then turned to Y Wu asking do you really not want to enter the Holy Temple if you're worried about Jay Wang chuan's order telling you to stay back and wait for instructions I can help after all I am still the mission Commander for this dungeon and I have the authority to send you wherever you want ywu smirked and replied no me we will stay outside the Holy Temple to provide defensive support anyway our team's members are still of low rank so it's a good opportunity to hunt beasts around here to level up Lu Fang excitedly chimed in the senior is Right Li Jessie nodded at this closed his eyes and commanded all right I officially assigned the King's Guard team to the area surrounding the Holy Temple for defense and Patrol to prevent wild insects from supporting the Holy Temple and to guard against a sneak attack from Hong Jang in his heart he thought although he says that I do not believe in Yu's intentions he is just like that even boss does not pay attention to him could it be that he is aiming for a bigger Target yiu nodded thank you master in fact what he was thinking was how can I seize the final control of this dungeon boss or whatever it's good if it comes by chance Ren Shon hearing the intentions of Yu's group hurriedly ran over excitedly and said boss I also want to go with everyone let me join suddenly a massive earthquake occurred ran xong screamed in fear why is there an earthquake could it be that the battle with boss inside the Holy Temple shook us here yiu felt it was strange no this Tremor is coming from underground right beneath us the system announced a warning warning warning the underground probe has detected a massive unknown creature rapidly approaching please take care to stay away just as the system finished speaking the ground immediately burst open startling everyone ah everyone was horrified to see a tremendous Force breaking through the ground the time from the warning to its appearance was so short how could they possibly avoid it a large tentacle stretched out within its mouth were hundreds of sharp teeth the system reported information giant Beast Sandstorm Incubus level 120 everyone gasped in Surprise what what the hell is this in front of them was a raging Sandstorm in cubis a level 120 dungeon boss stretching its massive tentacle head towards the crowd panic-stricken people began to flee fearfully exclaiming what is this a level 120 hidden boss it just appeared and is already rampaging like this run for your lives I haven't even married yet I don't want to die here liai saw the state of panic and shouted loudly calm down we still have fighting Power we haven't completely lost our ability to resist immediately direct the remaining defensive Firepower to concentrate fire on this hidden boss the artillery quickly positioned for attack continuously bombarding the giant Beast the boss's Health dropped to 95% upon seeing the boss get injured people felt a mixture of relief and worry sighing it really is effective the defensive turrets had been enhanced and could withstand two attacks from the boss forcing it to only defend however the boss's skin was too thick the current Firepower was not enough to deal substantial damage liai quickly ordered all teams from level 70 and above take the front line once the defensive turrets run out of ammo we must definitely draw the boss's aggro towards ourselves everyone take your positions and prepare to fight again inside the Holy Temple Juan how spoke up hello senior suddenly a level 120 boss has appeared outside do we need to allocate some combat power to support them if not I'm afraid they won't be able to hold out the Beast with the identity of sasta has been eliminated Wang Chu replied no need to be distracted focus on the enemy in front of us this boss through the connection with the Holy Temple has increased both attack and defense its true power reaching level 130 we must concentrate on attacking to avoid wasting our efforts hearing this Juan how quickly responded Yes G wine chew and charged forward while thinking this time I didn't mean to make things difficult but facing such a breakthrough situation I'm very curious to see how you will respond outside a tall man was rushing in bumping into yiu kiddo get out of my way don't block the path he roared yiu was startled looking at him then said hey you're running in the wrong direction the front line is over there why are you running behind behind him an entire bear fighter combat team at level 90 was pursuing him Mio xong the captain of the level 90 bare fighter combat team glared and shouted who do you think you are to manage aren't you supposed to be very skilled why don't you go up and fight the boss his followers spoke up senior we are currently the highest ranked combat team escaping like this will surely lead to punishment from the corporation Mio Shong looked at him and replied I have never fought a battle without certainty punishment is punishment but it is still better than losing my life staying here will definitely lead to death damn it who would know that we have escaped anyway in a panic someone rushed to report to Li jasai Master the bare fighter combat team has run away our highest ranked combat team now only has the level 85 storm battle team left liai frowned as he looked ahead thinking a bunch of weaklings could it be that their combat team ranks were all just upgraded at that moment Li changfang the captain of the level 885 storm battle team approached Li jasai and said seriously although the bare fighter combat team is quite strong their actions are cunning when they see the situation is unfavorable they run this does not surprise me rest assured our storm B team will fight until the last moment and will always stand by Yu he glanced at Yu's group and thought relying solely on their own combat team will not be enough to stop the enemy but adding Yu into the mix will be different I am sure that yiu is still hiding his true strength it is fortunate that yiu is allied with the young lady otherwise they would face an extremely formidable opponent yiu instructed each person Lu Fang you lead Yuni and the others to retreat this boss's appearance is somewhat strange and I must go clarify a few things Lu Fang quickly nodded understood senior yanf looked worriedly at Yu and said you you should be careful too Yu stood observing the artillery continuously firing at the large Beast the explosion sounds boom boom boom echoed and he pondered strange the boss is hidden yet it appears in a frenzied State can our side draw its aggro or is it because we attacked the Holy Temple earlier that we provoked it couldn't be sent by the Holy Temple the sandstorm Incubus was rampaging it's snout sucking everything into its belly everyone panicked and shouted it's over the boss is sucking the turret into its stomach our defenses have collapsed but it still has 80% of its Health left how are we supposed to fight it we're definitely going to die after sucking everything in it turned its snout in the opposite direction everyone was astonished to see it's not attacking us but is heading towards the Holy Temple what does it want to do suddenly the ground shook violently people gasped as they saw the sandstorm Incubus using its large snout to strike the Holy Temple this boss is attacking the Holy Temple aren't they on the same team why are they fighting each other what is going on y Wu excitedly said I understand now if I'm not mistaken this boss is definitely a monster and its Target is the energy Jor beneath the ground everyone was equally astonished what its large tentacle is continuing to strike the door of the Holy Temple bam yiu spoke up everyone look at the Old Wounds on its body given its defensive power a normal force definitely couldn't create such scars this must have occurred during its struggle for the energy core with the Holy Temple and our previous attacks caused the Holy Temple to absorb many energy cores which is why it got angry liasan stared at the Beast and said the greatest hatred of this boss all along has been toward the Holy Temple so it doesn't attack us such logic makes sense Lu Chang Fang beside him said although this boss is level 120 the Holy Temple isn't a question mark level it fundamentally doesn't stand a chance the frenzied Sandstorm Incubus was shot through its tentacle letting out a painful grunt its Health points only remaining at 50% everyone gasped good heavens is the holy Temple finally fighting back this boss in front of the Holy Temple is like a piece of tofu easily pierced through y Wu was horrified as he thought the Holy Temple still has this trick could it be that our artillery position is out of its attack range or does it not bother to attack us if not then when we unleash a bit of Firepower against it it only needs one or two attacks like this and we will fail thinking back it's really terrifying the beast in pain approached y group The growls echoed causing everyone to panic as they looked at it the boss is attacking us again this time has it completely lost its sanity lii quickly ordered everyone follow my command run towards the Holy Temple he gritted his teeth thinking this boss has completely fallen into a state of Madness we basically have no chance of winning although getting closer to the Holy Temple is also very dangerous at least it is better than facing the boss in this Frenzy State a loud noise echoed boom liai was startled to see two gears that had been separated blocking on both sides to protect everyone y w warned don't go toward the Holy Temple it's very dangerous over there too everyone was startled and looked at yiu is this the rampaging Beast that has been fixed the two gears were spinning wildly charging in and slicing through the tangle of tentacles Yi Wu observed from this side thinking carefully its current state is is very unstable getting close will be extremely dangerous moreover there could also be an impact from the battle with the boss inside he thought to himself the Mong group is already struggling to protect themselves they cannot assist leave it to me hearing this lii anxiously said you don't need to force yourself like this he had been fighting continuously through many battles and his body and mind must be very tired y Wu glanced behind and replied don't worry I can still endure this boss may have a thick shell but its brain capacity is quite thin I like the dumb ones like it lii looked at him and asked what you plan to do yiu did not take long to respond he quickly summoned Nana immediately gather all the mining robots to the position I indicate Nana responded instantly Yes master once the formation was fully prepared Yu said I will lure the boss over there then pull off a big stunt the lineup of mining robots was fully assembled arranged in a long line stretching for Miles Nana reported to yiu master everything has been gathered here as you requested yiu pra good very good Nana Nana then asked what should I do next Yu replied what we are about to face is a level 120 hidden boss I need you to give your all to do one thing didn't you previously leverage your ability to merge machinery to transform into a valkyrie form I need you to merge all the mining robots into a brand new combat robot one that is stronger with your capabilities it should be very easy to do right Nana unexpectedly showed a clear sense of worry this can't be true right could it be that he has discovered my true strength has he also realized my intent to kill him she questioned herself in anxiety how could that be if he knows my intention he definitely wouldn't treat me so kindly the characteristics of my abilities could indeed enhance the machines but how am I supposed to Face him next Yu suddenly spoke up startling Nana Nana what's wrong is my request feasible Nana responded immediately yes it can be done Master nana will do it right away out of gratitude for you saving my life she thought to herself I will follow your request so you can see the true power of the mechanical Queen with many highle bosses as materials even a level one 120 boss shouldn't be a problem having said that Nana commanded the machines to upgrade to their strongness form come on my machines become a part of me instantly the robots around began to detach and merge with Nana's main robot forming a reinforced Fusion she thought I will endure a little loss creating this robot according to your aesthetic the reinforcement process began first the chest then the arms and the back finally it the most critical part but perhaps she couldn't withstand it due to her low level and her Consciousness began to fade away you think the forced integration of so many machines has exceeded my abilities it's truly frustrating just one last step is all that's missing struggling to find a way to complete the enhancement y Wu fortunately arrived just in time to assist you're doing great Nana you've worked hard leave the rest to me I'll assemble the head thanks to the final piece from y wo they said successfully enhanced it creating the Crimson Moon Wild Lotus through the integration and transformation of the mining machines although it remained a mining machine at its core the enormous drill on its outer arm was capable of drilling through even the hardest magic crystals it was said that it could even pierce the sky yeu notice that the reaper was also on the verge of collapse so he instructed them to merge with the Crimson Moon Wild Lotus with all of you this machine will truly be complete it's time to strike Yu then maneuvered the Crimson Moon Wild Lotus to drill straight into the rampaging Sandstorm Incubus but it seemed to have no effect he laughed you're not too shabby huh my drill couldn't puncture you no wonder you've been feasting so well even my defensive Fortress has been completely devoured by you but no matter how solid it is my attacks will at least make you bleed now realized there was a risk and prly warned Master this intense attack method is consumed a massive amount of resources with the remaining resources we can only sustain this for about 2 more minutes y Wu immediately replied 2 minutes is enough he opened up to full power deciding to end the battle within 2 minutes yiu charged forward actively attacking the frenzi sandstorm Incubus with all his might how could it Dodge my attack what is it trying to do yiu frowned observing his opponent suddenly the frenzied Sandstorm Incubus swallowed a large amount of magic Crystal causing Yu to become Furious he shouted shut your mouth you bastard that's my magic Crystal do you have any idea how much money I lost for that piece n now witnessing the scene thought to herself why does my master lose his mind when it comes to money he completely transforms into a different person what's so valuable about that isn't it just a symbolic elusory item however this could also be considered my Master's biggest weakness I can exploit this to defeat him and make him secretly admire me I'll decide on that he the drill continued to pierce the frenzy Sandstorm Incubus but after swallowing the magic Crystal its body seemed unaffected the magic Crystal had hardened enveloping its body and enhancing its defensive capabilities Nana asked Yu Master if our weapon cannot penetrate what should we do next Yu cly replied isn't this just like the three-headed magic Crystal monster from the King's Landing club before we have experience dealing with this type so there's no need to panic y Wu immediately controlled the Crimson Moon Wild Lotus to LEAP up using strength to punch furiously at the boss he only needed to utilize absolute power to suppress it but it seemed to have no effect whatsoever Nana said Master our attack is fierce like a tiger but if you look closely the boss's Health hasn't decreased at all moreover there are only 20 seconds left before the fusion stake will be lifted yuku replied it's not the right time yet the effects of this fighting style will only appear at the very last moment when the enhancement time ends the Crimson Moon Wild Lotus must separate immediately the amount of resources has also been depleted it's hard to understand why it has gone so quickly Nano was worried the boss hasn't lost Health we're done for suddenly the sandstorm Incubus violently spewed out a thick green slime and imense quantity Nana was surprised what's wrong with the boss it was an unusual State dazed in creating a highlevel shock wave after Yu's Relentless punches the sandstorm Incubus had fallen into a dazed state and ejected a large number of items although the boss's Health didn't decrease somehow ywu managed to make it unconsciously enter this state and spit out numerous items damn it what kind of operation is this the sandstorm Incubus in a frenzied state crawled underground to escape seeing that nanet yelled Master it's running away should we Chase it while we have the upper hand Yu replied no need Let It Go our resources are exhausted and we can't continue fighting it any longer however to be precise we should consider it a stroke of good luck that we've been saved Yu looked at the vomit of the sandstorm in cubas the filthy mess splattered everywhere made him feel nauseous the most important thing right now was to deal with the pile of mixed equipment in that disgusting substance which emitted an unimaginable foul odor though he was very money-minded Yu did not have the courage to face this challenge so he ordered Nana Nana go help me retrieve that equipment Nana hearing the command froze her heart filled with grievance but she dared not protest she murmured Yes master how Despicable to not feel ashamed sending me to do such disgusting work you love money so much why why don't you do it yourself only knowing how to command me despite her dissatisfaction Nana still followed the order she shot a red bean from her eyes vaporizing the filthy slimy substance although it was a very disgusting task nna simply closed her sense of smell then used a high energy beam to evaporate the corrosive substance while conveniently sterilizing the equipment Yu saw Nana accomplished that and praised her so that's how it can be done well done Nana the sister immediately announced congratulations Master you have received 800,000 experience points 500,000 gold coins 50 level 100 magic crystals along with a rich array of equipment the Abyssal Master spear is a Malle weapon with the ability to enhance piercing damage and reduce armor points anything in its path has its weaknesses laid bare the underground invisible cloak is a thin cloak like the wings of a CA capable of masking Laura reducing hostility points by over 30% and increasing amplification Effects by 50% Crystal Clear bug saliva is a transparent liquid from an identified insect species which can be used in alchemy slimy cocoon a strange type of cocoon appears to still be riddling broken black slate is a fragment of an ancient mysterious Stone inscribed with bizarre scripts never seen before the key to the dungeon where trials from Level 1 to 50 take place allowing access to the special trial dungeon with unlimited uses the master has activated the special feature of the lucky ring the key to the dungeon where trials from Level 1 to 50 has been upgraded to the dungeon of Trials from Level 1 to 100 y Wu exclaimed upon harvesting many items what a Bountiful Harvest although these items are not particularly useful to me they offer significant support to the members of the combat team for instance the Abyssal Master Spear and underground invisible cloak will allow kayak side to un leash her maximum potential with these items Additionally the key to the dungeon trials from levels 1 to 100 has been upgraded by the luck ring making it useful for helping team members level up lastly we have the strangest item the slimy cocoon I can't help but wonder what's inside this cocoon it feels like there's a living creature in there Nana on the other hand completely opposed gw's enthusiasm seeing the slimy cocoon made her frown it's disgusting as a mechanical Queen I detest soft wriggly stuff like this suddenly the slimy cou began to move hey it seems like what's inside wants to break out this is getting interesting yiu said her eyes lighting up let's see what's inside turns out it's a baby Beal and it's a rare pet y w sheared with delight it's so small you already level 110 truly amazing Nana however appeared indifferent and shook her head it's just a little bug is it really necessary to be so excited about it the baby Beal upon seeing y woo and Nana for the first time immediately recoiled in fear into its cocoon y woo noticing this laughed and said kiddo you seem to be quite afraid of strangers huh don't be scared come out so I can see what you really are suddenly the baby Beetle spoke up you you can't do that I am the prince of insects you are not allowed to harm me hearing the baby beetles tone y wo chuckled so you're not just a cute pet a bit disappointing but what on Earth is a prince of insects I viz interjected speaking seriously it may sound like boasting but based on the system data it is not lying Nana cautiously warned Master be careful don't be quick to believe its words who knows it might be a disguise of some boss monster after all its rank is level 110 youu looked at the baby beetle with curiosity assuming you were the prince of insects how did you end up in the belly of that big beast if I hadn't beaten it to throw you up wouldn't you be stuck in its stomach for life upon hearing this the baby Beetle gleefully brightened up its eyes sparkling really you defeated that Sandstorm Incubus and saved me thank you you are my Lifesaver the baby Beetle immediately explained I am the king of this world living in the Holy Temple but one day my father was was brutally assassinated before I could investigate the reasons clearly my uncle quickly gathered factions using Force to seize the throne and abduct my mother to console the people they exiled me on the surface but in reality they directed allies to assassinate me to protect myself I had to devolve into a pupa but my life force gradually depleted if it weren't for you saving me I might have died in his belly ye woo upon hearing this [ __ ] to himself I didn't expect that within the insect World there would be such power struggles it seems that power not only changes people's hearts but even beasts are not exempt he would asked so what do you plan to do next if you want to play the role of a prince seeking Revenge how can you counter your uncle in your current tiny form the baby Beetle's eyes brightened as he looked at ywo aren't you here you are so strong you can definitely defeat my uncle please help me Yi Wu quickly declined no no I am not interested in the internal affairs of your insects nor do I want to get involved in any violence if you want to reclaim your position find someone else to help seeing this the baby Beetle said regaining the position is not the goal I just want to save my mother and stop my uncle from destroying this world because if it continues like this this world will be destroyed if you help me defeat my uncle you can be king Yu then became very excited so what are we waiting for me being King is basically unrealistic but to prevent this world from being destroyed I have to help you defeat your uncle moreover a human like me cannot become the king of your insects the baby Beatle bit yiwu's hand just like that is enough Nana pretended to be worried about y woo ah your insect dared to bite my master but deep down she was truly malicious hemp why didn't you bite harder y wo noticing the glowing mark on his hand curiously asked what is this glowing Mark the baby Beetle explained this is our Clan's Mark as long as you have it you were qualified to become king commanding the former subordinates of my father Although our numbers are very small and we are exiled to the edge of the world hearing this Yu's eyes lit up saying so as long as I become king I can dominate this world and do whatever I want the baby Beetle looked a bit worried and said that's right but please don't do anything strange I hope I didn't choose the wrong person right suddenly liai called y Wu V woo how's the situation on your side yiu replied basically it's all handled unfortunately the boss has escaped Li ji said it's okay it's good that we can return safely the battle on the Mong group's side has also concluded but that was a little problem you need to hurry back hearing this ye W immediately turned back when he arrived arrived at the inner Courtyard of the Holy Temple yiu saw that the Mong group had dealt with the gatekeeper boss Yan XA was poisoned and in a strange state after inhaling a lethal poisonous gas he had entered a countdown state if the poison was not cured within an hour his body would rot and he would die seeing this y would asked what's wrong with him this boss is quite vicious Juan how replied isn't it because this guy was eager to fight and carelessly got hit by the boss's attack before he could use his skill resulting in this state Lulu was trying to treat young XA but there were no promising results this boss my magic can't dispel it it seems we need a special antidote but we don't have it Li ji standing the side also said if we could take him back to the headquarters the corporation's resources could help the Alchemists research an antidote very quickly but even then it wouldn't be within an hour everyone was waiting hoping to be able to open the teleportation gate y Wu cannnot see death without intervening isn't it true that you will be in danger as well even though this person keeps targeting me his death would also be a loss for the organization at the very least she would be heartbroken over it Wang Chuan is really cold-hearted he thinks joining the Mong group means accepting that one could sacrifice at any moment if he can't be saved then it simply his faith there's no need to hesitate because of this the key issue is that the current team is short-handed and Y Wu will temporarily fill this vacancy Yu is surprised by Wang chuan's decision and asks what do you mean you want me to join the Mong group hearing G wi chuan's decision everyone is taken a back and begins to discuss fervently G Wang Chuan has actually let that kid join the Mong group one person Whispers did I hear wrong I wouldn't even dare to dream of joining the Mong group it's just that my strength doesn't allow it but y will not only managed to control the massive insect Army at the front line but also scare off the boss beforehand he really is qualified for this Li Chang Fang pers questioning what gwang chuan's intentions might be seeing the reactions of everyone Yi Wu steps forward and interrupts can we put this aside for now there are more important matters at hand gwan Chun turns to him and asks what is it y Wu approach song yanell who was critically injured Ling on the ground and said I want to see if I can save him everyone did not believe Yu's words what a joke even the goddess danl could not heal him so how could he think he could hearing this Lu Fang could not help but retort this bastard is always rude to seniors yet the senior still manages to save him without holding a grudge he is really lucky the girl next to Lu Fang saw this and did not forget to mock ye Wu must have some ulterior motive for acting this way didn't you say he has offended you many times before and now he's obediently acting like a junior isn't he Lu Fang heard the sarcasm in her words but did not refute it silently acknowledging that he truly was foolish in the past looking at Yu's back he thought in the past I really was blind and did not know what true strength was it was the senior who helped me understand what true greatness is both in terms of strength and character a girl with white hair furrowed her brows and asked this poison is not easy to cure are you sure you are not being foolish if you cure him our team will no longer need you you are digging your own grave for your future at this moment a man wearing a large Buddhist necklace around his neck clasped his hands before his chest and interrupted if y wo has a Compassionate Heart then let him try saving a person is also a form of kindness leya irritated shouted what kind of logic is operating in your head while everyone was still arguing sa yancha lying unconscious on the ground suddenly woke up opened one eye to look at yiu and said I do not need you to treat me cough cough cough seeing that song Young Shia even on the brink of death still refused to yield words ye Wu chuckled and advise I suggest you can serve your energy to avoid dying too soon even in a near-dead state son young sha remain Resolute in not allowing Yu to treat him grinting his teeth to endure the pain he stated you don't need to pretend to be kind-hearted i s yancha am not the kind of person who clings to life out of fear of death when I joined the Mong group I was mentally prepared as long as I could become stronger I would not hesitate to sacrifice my own life yiu was left speechless by him he sat down bowed his head to look at him and said I have no interest in your matters my true purpose in doing this is for yinan because I took your place she was suspended from Duty and that gave you the opportunity to join mokong if you sacrifice your life over this with her character she will definitely blame herself immensely therefore it can be said that saving your life has nothing to do with you song Yan was taken aback by Yu's explanation I didn't expect it to be like this he is tormenting me I had prepared myself for the fact that I would definitely not survive and now he is giving me hope to continue living while using reasons that make it impossible for others to refuse too despicable seeing song Yan Show's attitude soften agreeing to let him treat her Yu turned to a vis and asked a vis with the current medicinal herbs available can you concoct an antidote to cure this poisoning State Elder lie of Wong Jang had given us many precious remedies and herbs before right I Vis replied I'm sorry Master but right now there is no remedy available in stock to concoct this antidote hearing this y wo panicked and questioned what you were pretending to be capable and now you say it can't be cured I Vis broke into a cold sweat thinking that this matter had nothing to do with him at that moment a chubby spiritual creature appeared on Yu's shoulder and spoke up I have a way I saw that in your system storage there is a a crystalline insect saliva that you just obtained it can be used to create the antidote y Wu was overjoyed finally there's an alternative so it can be used for this purpose however he couldn't help but Ponder aren't you afraid of being discovered by others when you leave my system space on your own a crystalline insect saliva is the clear mucus of a certain type of snake it is unclear which insect it belongs to but it seems that it can be used to concat Medicine ye Wu squinted and said to her it's okay I have a hidden technique to keep me safe they won't see me although crystalline insect cell is effective as an antidote using it solely for detoxification would be quite wasteful if utilized properly it could be concocted into something even better such as by fusing and refining it yiu quickly decided saving people is the most important thing right now he said let's fuse it with the most advanced antidote I currently have the systems voice rang out announcing the completion of the concoction congratulations Master you've have obtained a potion with 10 times the essence of insects this is a brand new product the result result of fusing the essence of insects potion and a highlevel antidote the potion Works gradually to detoxify insects counteract lethal toxins and maintains its effect for 10 continuous hours the girl wearing glasses named Lulu took the vial of potion and exclaimed in surprise you actually made an antidote but it seems it can't completely eliminate the poison it can only temporarily relieve it onean how beside her smiled broadly and said to her don't be so strict l going from 1 hour to 10 hours is already impressive Yu stood up put his hands in his pockets and said to them although I could concoct a complete antidote I can only produce one portion to prepare for any future encounters with insect poisoning during battles I intentionally divided the effect of the potion into 10 parts this way at least we can buy ourselves some more time Juan how had great trust in yu and praised him as expected of ywo your thoughts are truly thorough Master liai clasped his hands and approached to analyze the situation in these 10 hours is the golden time for rescue now we have two options one is to build the teleportation door within 10 hours as long as we make good use of the or mining robots you created it should not be a big problem the second option is to quickly clear the dungeon and complete the mission as long as we can clear the dungeon we will be able to obtain return Scrolls and can also return to the headquarters for professional treatment y w rais the next issue my or mining machines have already been depleted in the battle against the sandw boss and now only two are left however if they are run at full power perhaps one house side looked at yiu and said you really love to pose challenging problems for others then we can only choose the second option however the teleportation door must also be improved and constructed at the same time Yu took the medicine bottle approach s Yan sha who was sitting down held the bottle out in front of him and said although the medicine is ready whether to drink it or not is up to you s Yan XA endured the pain took the bottle and drank it all in one go I trust in the strength of Mong group and the captain 10 hours is enough hearing that song yanell had finished drinking but only trusted the team without saying a word of thanks to Yu one person feeling indignant shouted ungrateful our senior saved you and yet you don't even have a word of thanks wi Chuan seeing that the situation had progressed a bit walked towards the two and said I won't make any promises to anyone the mission comes first we won't handle the task carelessly just to save time let's go Yu looked at G Wang Chuan as he walked by and suggested before we depart I have a small request may I bring my team members along after all we are a whole before ni could finish speaking one how vehemently objected what are you crazy ye woo the place we are about to go is the nest of the insects with an average level above 80 if you bring along those underlings around level 50 isn't that just leading them to their deaths Yu turned to reassure him don't worry I have my plans even hearing this Juan how still tried to find another reason first of all no matter your plans our senior will not agree to this kind of request from you not waiting for him to finish speaking Wang Chu made a decision it's fine have your people set off whether you go to seek your own death or for some other reason as long as you don't hinder me from carrying out my mission I won't stop you Juan Hal questioned if it were a normal situation senior would definitely not care about such requests with Y woo senior has often been quite accommodating what exactly are your intentions the Lost Holy Temple deep within the monsters are howling everywhere aha How can there be such brutal humans run run they are fighting fiercely to gain experience points L Fang stood on the side satisfied joyfully speaking with ye woo and the others haha following the bosses to clear the highlevel dungeon for experience points is truly amazing the experience points are increasing rapidly while this excited everyone Lu Fang had some concerns senior is it really appropriate for us to blatantly watch such a spectacle you who did not care shrug then stuffed his hands into his pockets stepping on a fallen monster who cares about them winew and said nothing more not wanting to worry about such matters the chubby little creature from before named baby Beal reappeared on Yu's shoulder he turned to it and asked how are you doing baby Beetle seems a bit off it clung tightly to his shoulder then expressed their feelings he sensed a wave of ominous Aura this is clearly the palet that I was once very familiar with but now feels so alien moreover I feel deep within the Holy Temple an emanation of very evil and desperate Aura hearing this Yi Wu also felt that the situation was not right now that you mention it I seem to sense it too strange auras began to emanate all around he wondered what secret is ultimately hidden deep within this lost Holy Temple y Wu recognized this Aura as very familiar he turned to Baby Beal and asked this Aura is most likely emanated by your uncle how did the Holy Temple look like before is it significantly different from now baby Beetle nodded in agreement with Yu's words and began to explain of course it was different before under the reign of my father the Holy Temple was filled with pure and divine energy the citizens of the race all lived very happily those days were supposed to last but since my uncle took power everything has changed the pure energy of the the Holy Temple has turned into evil and polluted energy those who were infected by the evil energy lose their rationality becoming aggressive and insane ye Mo asked in astonishment is the energy of the Holy Temple that you speak of the energy core emanating from deep within the Earth what differences were there between before and now the baby Beetle was also surprised by his knowledge what you actually know about the existence of the energy core it's truly hard to believe it's not called the energy core but rather the heart of the insect this is not only the source of the power of the Holy templ but also the energy source of the entire world uncle is using powerful evil energy to gradually corrupt it however if we can purify it in time it could still be restored to its original state but if it continues like this once it's completely corrupted the entire world will fall into chaos and collapse after hearing the baby be will explain he held his head in despair thinking damn it it's not easy to encounter a perfect dungeon like this if it's completely corrupted what will I have left this is forcing me to speed up if I don't hurry this duck will fly away at this moment leya from a distance was being pursued by a colorful dragonfly an elite level 85 seeing the group behind her with relatively low levels she said Hayes I'm sorry I've attracted a beast I'm also afraid there's nowhere to release my anger yuu shouted I'm in a bad mood with nowhere to vent don't block my way without any wasted motion he jumped up and split the colorful dragonfly in half with a single strike easily ensuring it died before it could even gasp only managing to let out a gor gor gar sound before falling silent seeing y wo suddenly make a move one how excitedly turned to say why is this kid y w suddenly so active I thought he just wanted to hang back and Le off the experience points the bald guy with the beaded necklace also chimed in even though he doesn't need to participate in the battle right now it seems like he can't hold back the surging power within him Lulu was about to say something more when leyer scoffed and said I was planning to teach him a lesson but it turned out to be an easy fix pointless hearing that Lulu turned to question did you purposely ride on the beast's attack the other person immediately felt guilty and denied oh I didn't Lulu ignored him and suggested for next month's team rewards I want to reconsider the distribution method Leia anxiously pleaded please don't sister Lulu I was wrong y Wu felt fortunate that Lulu had spoken up he thought great finally she has come to the Forefront baby Beetle then presented Yu with a choice next you will have to face two options Yu felt intrigued and asked Choice what choice I don't have time to choose right now nor do I want to keep you waiting the baby Beetle quickly replied just go straight ahead and not far ahead you will come to a fork in the road One path leads directly to the depths of the Holy Temple my uncle and his bodyguard team are probably there the other path leads to the incubation room my uncle is exploiting the dark energy to enhance and speed up the hatching of the main species cultivating a large number of soldiers to serve as Expendables for the war hearing this yiwu stroked his chin and thought he silently pondered no wonder last time the number of insects in the Epic Level special event was 10 times greater it turns out the hatching speed has changed although I really want to head straight to the lair now the incubation room must be prioritized I can't let it keep producing violent soldiers at such a fast rate otherwise the people outside will be in danger Yu continued to think however if I tell the cold-faced guy the truth he will definitely ignore the incubation room and choose to go straight to the Holy Temple with his personal he absolutely won't care about the safety of the outside people or the mission he looked at G Wang Chun who was fiercely battling the monsters and made a decision so I have to think of another way after defeating the monsters the group moved forward and encountered a fork in the road Juan how angrily muttered same old trick every dungeon maze has this one side is a trap and a dead end while the other side has a treasure mirror Lulu standing behind also reported on the situ situation at the two forks in the road she said that the drones sent to scout the pths had all been shot down it seemed that no matter which way they went there were heavy troops guarding a teammate next to her asked so what should we do are we just supposed to rely on our instincts to guess the way headshaved you usually use magic to make precise predictions why not give us some advice head shaved immediately shook his head in refusal no I can't Sid stepping into this the Lost Holy Temple my connection with my Buddha has been interrupted y Wu confidently stepped forward and said to everyone relying on my rich experience and instincts I choose to take this path onean how upon hearing this Express trust I believe in you normally you have many tricks but this time you must have discovered something head shaved also nodded in agreement my judgment is not different from your instincts G Wang Chuan unexpectedly went straight in the opposite direction from the path that ye W had chosen Juan how standing beside him also didn't know what to do silently thinking is there really disagreement over the path chosen jiwan Chuan furrowed his brow and said I don't believe in your strange intuition I only trust my own judgment the whole team follow me although at first everyone agreed with Yu's intuition GW Chuan was still their senior the leader orders cannot be disregarded the whole team had no choice but to respond and continue following gwang Chu while walking everyone turned to comfort y woo our captain is always like this once he makes a decision no one can change it you can only listen to him yiu smiled politely in response I understand who told him his strength is the greatest regarding these monster roadblocks G Wang Chuan only needed to deliver a single blow to eliminate them as easy as slicing fruit upon entering the room he was surprised to discover that this was the incub a room at the Holy Temple everyone exclaimed is this the incubation room of the insects y Wu pretended to be surprised did we actually make it to the incubation room of the insects the captain's instinct is truly remarkable for finding the layer of the insect Army but in his heart y Wu felt smug thinking that's only natural wasn't this due to the negligence of a certain individual Juan how excited and ready for action said although this isn't the final boss area finding the source of the insect waves is still a considerable gain let's quickly destroy this place the teammates around him eagerly chimed in haha destroying things is my specialty giaba suddenly questioned ywu how did you know for sure that he would choose this path what if he and you happened to choose the same route understanding jaa's concerns y Wu confidently explained that can't happen ji Wang Chuan has never trusted in me from the beginning with his personality he would never choose the same path as me I'm simply taking advantage of his tendency to do the opposite Yu continued now the road is chosen by him even if he cries he must go all the way Yu turned at his team and commanded let's go we need to help we have to act fast before these monster eggs hatch and quickly destroy this place Lu Fang finally waited for the senior's order he eagerly replied all right senior I've been itching to get started just sitting around and enjoying so many experience points is truly addictive it was at this moment that ji Wang Chuan realized he had been tricked by yiu he approached and blocked Yu's path asking you did that on purpose right but y Wu just smiled mischievously evading the arm that was holding him and running away saying loudly huh Captain G what did you just say what purpose I was running so fast I didn't hear clearly seeing this ji Wang Chun thought he must have overanalyzed and he shook his head replying never mind it's nothing upon hearing this yiu immediately said great then he hurriedly ran off leaving g w chewing watching him with a cold expression a murderous intent clearly visible on his face he thought to himself did this guy truly not mean it or has he guessed my true intentions as he ran yiu suddenly felt a chill down his spine he turned pale as he realized G wi chuan's murderous intent I get it now I get it but warning of your murderous intent I've received it he told himself although I can't be sure about your true motives you can still use invisible killing intent to warn me yiu continued no wonder you are the top Master of the mo attack team not to be underestimated boom something just fell to the ground they hurriedly ran over to check the situation what happened something fell from the sky the boss of the dungeon finally appeared she was Furious looking at them and said you dare to destroy my Lair then you will have to use your own bodies to compensate Diana smiled mockingly glancing at them you tiny humans could actually break the great door of the Holy Temple and invade my territory how surprising but this is where it ends because you will all die here or if you are lucky become nutrients at this moment leya full of excitement said as a spider with a human upper body I must say quite beautiful Juan how felt speechless my brother your taste is a bit special you can even swallow a bug Diana felt insulted but still maintained a smile on her face she spoke sarcastically what a rude bunch of humans a scrawny person with not even a muscle on their chest dares to doubt this extremely perfect form of life of mine you all have only one outcome just go die you don't even have the qualification to become nutrients Diana continued however she moved closer to G wine chewing showing great interest you look different from them not only is your strength impressive but your appearance is not bad either are you interested in being my male pet that way not only will you continue to live but you will also live very happily gwan chew coldly Unleashed a move severing Diana's leg I have no interest in insects Diana screamed in pain becoming Furious the gem on her forehead also blazed with fire you you dare to ruin my perfect body unforgivable they all must die y Wu quietly said to Juan how beside him no wonder he is the top combatant facing such Temptation without wavering truly worthy of being a role model for us onean how replied honestly I don't mean anything by it you don't follow his example I i' never seen him react to women in his eyes there has only been the mission and the desire to become stronger to say it bluntly he actually a immediately a wave of killing intent accompanied by gwan chuan's Cold gaze swept over forcing Juan how who was speaking to fall silent G Wang Chuan spoke slowly and deliberately Wan how you said quite a lot today onean Hal covered in sweat hurriedly replied I I didn't say anything Yu quickly chimed in I didn't hear anything either these two looked truly cowardly remembering that Diana was still standing there G Wang Chun adjusted his demeanor all right let's not waste any more time let's resolve this quickly the whole teen lunged forward in unison understood y Wu began assigning roles telling Lu Fang you take this rare opportunity to observe the battle from a close distance watch how the top team faces the boss l Fang replied eagerly understood Juan how quickly Unleashed his skills while the older brother wearing the prayer beads cast his own skill Leia also seriously displayed her skills while Lulu used the spell city of blessings from the side Diana trapped in the middle showed clear signs of helplessness and confusion she tried to fight back but all her efforts were in vain with support from his teammates ji wangchu and swiftly drove his sword executing a secret technique and shouted secret sword Return of the Dragon as the move concluded Diana could only lay out a weak whimper before collapsing with just one move G Wang Chuan has caused the stats of D andana to drop significantly my current health is only at 20% and my defense is down to 18% Ru and tyen tyan stands to the side maltha gape in amazement so amazing so amazing no wonder they are the strongest team in Han Mo the boss simply has no power to fight back Dan L's healing and buffing skills are truly exceptional Yun F silently analyzes they not only cooperate seamlessly but their movement skills are also very agile the boss's attack skills haven't hit anyone at all Lu Fang nods in agreement that's right everyone easily fulfills their roles not only is the DPS very high but they also minimize pressure to the maximum it's truly a perfect team y is also very enthusiastic it seems everyone has their own gains although the Gap is currently large the path we need to take is still very long I believe that one day we will also be able to reach this kind of Realm level everyone is filled with High Spirits kexi standing over there has bright eyes she begins to think could this also be considered a type of love the bond and friendship between teammates seemed different from the feelings between myself and Miel ba she continued this kind of genuine hopeful feeling is something I haven't experienced in a thousand years meeting ywu is truly wonderful ji Wang Chu and suddenly felt something affecting his hand the unusual sensation was growing stronger at the same time her speed and strength had increased significantly this was not the buff effect from danl but came from another source this feeling had only appeared since Yu's team had joined thinking back the efficiency of monster clearing in the previous small battle battles had also improved greatly couldn't it be that yiu was secretly doing something or was it due to the mysterious teammates beside him this point was truly important he had to find an opportunity to clarify it giaba turned to yiu and asked liwo could you ask your friends to spare the spider Queen's life yigu was surprised why giab explained because the Spider Queen was once the closest subordinate of my mother she might know information related to my mother Yi Wu hesitated a bit this is very difficult first of all they are not my friends we are only temporarily cooperating if I want them to give up their benefits for me basically you are dreaming if I just ask them outright I'm afraid it will only raise GW truan suspicions he continued if he accidentally discovers the existence of people it will be very Troublesome hearing that giaba felt disheartened and replied all right then at that moment the was truly Furious she growled damn it I never expected that small humans like you could force me to this extent saying that she grabbed her own face and peeled off the peeling mask revealing her true face with countless eyes on it looking truly terrifying Diana had revealed her true form coldly stating the only way left is to use my strongest power to annihilate you leay was taken aback and blurted out damn you should put the mask back on looking like that I really can't bring myself to fight oh my god brother it turns out you still want to go easy all this time Juan how angrily shouted you're about to die and you're still playing these disgusting tricks it's truly detestable let me send you back to meet your ancestors as he spoke he charged forward ready to strike suddenly he saw Diana sneering is that so the one who was about to meet the ancestors is not me but you L Juan Hal felt a strange numbing Sensation that rendered his body unable to move seeing that he had been affected Diana's eyes sparkled revealing her bright white teeth like a mad Fox and she laughed loudly ha it's true that you can't use your strength because from the moment you stepped into this egg laying room you've already been hit by my illusion toxin this toxin is colorless odorless capable of penetrating through all levels the only drawback is that its onset is a bit slow which is why I patiently engaged in Trivial chatter to buy time with you she laughed heartily now let you experience a bit of the ultimate Allure of my illusional toxins everyone in the team had already collapsed G Wang Chuan was both Furious and astonished I never expected that even I could be affected so strongly by this toxin at that moment a shadow appeared looking exactly like him he smiled wickedly and replied me aren't you the same he was G Wang chewan a mutated being at level 130 over there y who was not doing much better he cautiously looked at his mutated self the one opposite him ye woo at level 12 wore a wicked smile exuding A Dangerous Aura that's right I am you completely identical to you and you will never escape this illusion for the rest of your life you will fight with me for eternity until you meet your demise y Wu remains silent leading the other party to believe that he had been intimidated the other person arrogantly continued what's wrong shocked by this truth or are you too afraid to make a move when you see your own face ha but he was mistaken yiu suddenly charged forward delivering a punch that sent the mutated one's face ASU he said thank you for creating an opportunity for me to be alone with you Yu cracked his knuckles and continued it seems you were not truly me because even when angered I am capable of fighting he was not afraid at all his gaze un flinching fixed on the mutated one jabal on his shoulder also joined in making a mocking face at the opponent the mutated one stood in a grotesque posture his voice elongated really it seems you still don't understand the current situation in fact Yu did not fully understand he stared intently at his mutated counterpart thinking to himself I truly don't understand if it is just an exterior level clone perhaps he would only reach level 10 but looking at this guy defensive capabilities it seems he possesses even my abilities at level 20 could it be he can even replicate the entire system suddenly the mutated figure vanished Yi Wu felt a moment of confusion as he realized the other had appeared right behind him you are me I am you he clenched his teeth his expression tense it's too fast this must definitely be level 20 Yu could only defend himself shouting ah but I still lost 20% of my Health Yi Wu mutated quickly explained our real strength is comparable but he thought to himself it's speed and strength are indeed not inferior to mine could it be that it has replicated the entire system as well he manifested the LW its light radiating in all directions then charged straight at the mutated entity if that's really the case then it's a hassle I need to find a way to verify on the other side Yi Wu mutated mirrored him also Conjuring a heavy sword he calmly said nice sword but I have one too The Clash of weapons echoed loudly the sound piercing yeu was taken AB back and shouted have you really replicated the power of the chai Emperor I possess the mutated entity responded while fighting replicated is not entirely accurate it's more correct to say it's a projection because when you entered this illusion we are indeed one entity your powers are my Powers you wo retorted if we are one entity then neither of us can kill the other so what you intend to achieve the mutated entity smiled dangerously its eyes gleaming this Visionary toxin is originally a top level control skill the main goal is to trap you in this infinite mental illusion so you will forever fight alongside me as for your real body out there I will handle it of course depending on my mood seeing that the situation seemed Bleak yiu suddenly came up with an idea and began to act deeply he thought to himself I need to change tactics immediately therefore Yu shifted to acting deeply so annoying this move is too difficult to break not only am I trapped without being able to break through but even fighting doesn't seem promising the win rate is only about 50% originally there was no chance of winning even someone as strong as G wangchu cannot resist Yu believed that his opponent had fallen into the Trap confidently thinking he was in the dominant position no matter who comes it will be the same the strength of this poison illusion move is that it can control anyone regardless of rank no matter how you hide your power or rank it's useless before you is your truest self once you step into this illusion you will never find a way out unless you kill me but that is impossible haha he intended to strike down with a sword from above but little did he know y wo who originally thought he was at a disadvantage suddenly counterattacked act unleashing a series of techniques aimed at his mutated form he told himself if it can't be done I must do it I don't believe you can replicate everything about me including my system finally the original being could no longer maintain his calm as before he anxiously asked system what system your ability only has the attribute of charm don't talk nonsense don't think you can defeat me Yi Wu thought to himself that was a close call I really thought it could repli ate my system however on the outside Yi Wu maintained the cold expression and continued acting he secretly blamed damn it even using all my strength it's just a 50/50 chance am I destined to be trapped here forever giaba hastily encouraged guwu Don't Give Up cheer up the mutated original being noticed jaaba and said with a tone of surprise although I noticed it earlier I didn't expect it to really be you your highness why have you become this Tim appearance haha it seems you are still as weak as before your highness gioa with eyes welling up not thinking much only worried about yo said I I have no intention of overthrowing the monarchy I just want to return to the Holy Temple to say goodbye a mother please don't harm y woo please don't harm y wo anymore the mutated original being cruy replied with a tone full of contempt your wish has been dashed but I can compassionately tell you something right now your mother is being imprisoned in the transformation room on the last floor of the Holy Temple suffering pain and torment every day who told her not to reveal that secret so how about it after knowing this news will you thank me more haha ye will realized his intention had been achieved and immediately stopped the ACT indeed thank you for only replicating my abilities not my intellect all right the questions that needed to be asked have been asked no more acting we should go outside the whole world truly owes you and Jaa an award you not acting is indeed a great loss to the world of Cinema the altered G wo looked as if he just eaten D bewildered and asked acting going outside what are you talking about are you mentally disordered Yu did not hurry to explain to that dull-witted alter being you still dare to claim you are the same as me and you can't even recognize my acting skills which are against the norm I was just pretending to be weak to help jaau EES drop on news about its mother Gaba also yelled that's right the altered y wo began to get angry do you dare to deceive me he then threw a kick even if I was tricked by you what can be done if we can't get out it's just a waste anyway y Wu remained unshaken well not necessarily right didn't you just tell me yourself your illusional toxin only steals my true level and abilities but it still hasn't managed to steal my actual killing blow at this moment the mutated entity exclaimed a fatal blow what fatal blow we have merged what do I still have that you don't know could it be the system you mentioned earlier yiu appeared mysterious and replied guess his attitude was truly impressive making it impossible for me not to silently applaud he quickly commanded the system system bet all accumulated experience points on the Chen Emperor how many levels can the connection ranking be raised the system responded currently the accumulated experience value can raise the connection to level 130 Additionally the system exists from a higher Dimension and is not affected by anything the mutated entity stepped forward and said I guess you at that moment y Wu also commanded system withdraw all experience value and the account of the chaien emperor I need to continue enhancing my survival capabilities the system immediately announced conversion complete the connection ranking has reached level 130 unlocking the second attribute of The chaien Emperor's account the shadow attribute y Wu held the sword with one hand yes he really did catch the sword with his bare hand no one misheard that he thought to himself so finally the shadow attribute the second attribute has finally been unlocked the system explained after the Chen Emperor fell into darkness the power of the Flaming meteor attribute was suppressed and thus transformed into the black flame a stronger Shadow attribute the system continued the black flame is not only more powerful but can also materialize and its forms of attack are much more varied it possesses an entirely new attack capability even when facing an enemy approximately 30 levels stronger I can still cope normally Yu was surprised murmuring wow it truly is the mb+ level with this power even if Sulu comes to take revenge I will not back down from her could this be a doubling of the dark transformation I like it I like it after saying that he looked at the mutated entity his eyes shining with a cold purple Hue he declared did you not want to fight me until the end the second battle begins at this moment he dawned a new armor a dangerous purple Aura emanating around gwu's body causing him to feel a sense of panic the mutated guwu stuttered you you leveled up in the spirit illusion again how is that possible how could you increase three levels in a row you are only one level above me I shouldn't be losing immediately he activated the demon controller skill Yi Wu remained still coldly saying I must admit this Camp item has replicated my abilities quite well even the innate skill is being utilized y Wu also executed a similar move in response to the smug mutated entity of course I just need to hold on a little longer before you kill me to destroy your true physical form Yi Wu calmly replied having your true body in your hands is truly a nuisance but I won't give you the time you need a massive sword Lance penetrated the array descending from above the mutated entity he was taken AB letting out a cry of pain in an instant the mutated entity was pinned firmly to the ground immediately after yiu opened his eyes finally back yiu realized I am being rolled into a cocoon surrounded by a swarm of the newborn insects they all turned towards him chanting in unison die human Diana suddenly sensed something and said that human not only has the ability to self-level up but can also break the chaples of Illusion I must quickly return to report to the prince she dashed away but could not Escape yo now having awakened the shadow attribute surprised Diana as she realized a wall of fire suddenly Rose encircling her this is y Wu coldly said want to run I haven't agreed yet Diana knew she couldn't resist so she knelt down and earnestly begged for her life please spare my life you are the one who holds the power of life and death and I am only forced into a corner as long as you spare me I am willing to devote myself to your highness leading you into this secret path to save your mother please you must believe me gabal seemed a bit moved and leaned close to ye W to plead V woo she is speaking so sincerely why not spare her life moreover she will lead us to save your mother seeing jiaa appear soft-hearted Diana secretly rejoiced great this fool is weak-hearted just wait I will lead you into a trap and have the prince chop you into a 100 pieces but before she could feel triumphant Diana was decisively struck down by Yu's sword falling to the ground in ja bows astonishment she panicked and shouted y woo Diana with a weak voice full of resentment before fading away said why I was so close to success Yi Wu call looked at giaa and analyzed you are too Nave G yiu continued you must never easily trust the remorse of a traitor because if someone has betrayed you once they can betray you a second time if you truly want to become the king of the insects you absolutely cannot be soft-hearted towards traitors do you understand gabal pondered Yu's words with a heavy heart and nodded slightly I understand now perhaps it was my weakness that led to the current situation y wo indeed you are more suitable to be king than I am Yi Wu reassured him if there are truly many benefits I could also consider it and we can think about it later right now the most important thing is to seize the moment to see what Treasures this spider has dropped looking at Yu from behind giaba couldn't help but admire him clearly strong to the point of not resembling a human but in reality he is like an ordinary human the system began to announce the items received congratulations host you have received the boss kill reward of 5 million in cash 1 million experience points along with some items fatal black thread the current information of which is still unclear and the venomous spider que blade crafted from the broken leg of the Spider Queen the blade has a strange appearance difficult to wield for ordinary people and the edge is Tainted with dangerous toxins please do not Lick It Before fighting system notification the attack characteristic will cause the target to be poisoned maintaining a loss of life value the toxicity can stack up to a maximum of 10 layers when fully stacked the target will fall into an incapacitated State this state can be dispelled next is puppet illusion this skill can imprison the enemy in an illusion creating a mental puppet equal to the enemy's level to fight damage in the mental space will reflect back onto the physical body and can last for 3 minutes note that when the target's body is in the rigid state of the illusion puppet no further damage can be inflicted the system notification continues the next item is Zerg Essence a mysterious material dropped from the insect boss this item appears bizarre perhaps someone will know how to use it yiu rested his chin and thought the items from this boss lean towards control the poison dagger and the illusion puppet can draw the opponent into a mental illusion fatal black threads sounds a bit off I wonder what you Zerg Essence has jaau exclaimed in surprise I can't believe it's Zerg Essence y Wu turn to ask is it very rare what is its specific use giaba excitedly explained further this Zerg Essence is a rare organization found only in the bodies of the strongest creatures it can increase cellular activity stimulate and unleash tremendous power after I was fired and consumed by the nightmare in order to save my life I exhausted the Zerg Essence in my body causing my body to weaken into its current appearance but if I can absorb three Zerg Essences I will completely restore my Peak strength and normal form gabal spoke sincerely hoping that y w would leave it for him V woo can you sell me this Zurg Essence right now I have nothing of equivalent value to offer you but I promise to give you a valuable treasure and return later seeing the sincerity in ja's eyes yiu agreed without hesitation all right after all this thing is of no use to me you are the prince don't make that kind of face moreover I will help you gather enough three Zerg Essences so you can return to normal that way we will have formidable combat power at level0 Jal looked at yiu with te eyes filled with emotion rushed to hug him and exclaimed is this real this is truly amazing Joba continued vwoo you really are my great benefactor meeting you is the greatest luck of my life I don't know how to repay you wah wah wah he gently patted him on the back comforting all right I said you were the prince you should have the demeanor of a prince crying all day like this the sound of loud explosions rang out the group accompanying G Wang Chuan had landed safely Juan how joyfully turned to ji Wang Chuan and said damn it we finally got out of the mental illusion senior did you kill the boss to save us Captain G shyly replied it wasn't me it was Yi wo perhaps he defeated himself in the mental illusion he was the first to awaken and then he killed the boss that is why we were saved the entire group was astonished exclaiming in unison what Captain G affirmed firmly though it sounds unbelievable looking at his level everyone thinks it must be him it can't be wrong one person in the group thought to himself although I also considered that leveling up within the illusion could defeat the distorted form of oneself even if I Risk Everything to fight I could only match the distorted form there was really no way to level up how did he manage to do it even if I directly ask him now he won't say anything it seems Yan Juan wasn't wrong this Yi Wu guy is very mysterious he was concentrating on his thoughts when he suddenly heard Yu calling him Captain G are you all okay the items that dropped from the boss earlier are with me do you need me to hand them over for you to manage Captain G awkwardly turned his face away and replied no need you can keep them G's subordinate Wang Chuan suddenly spoke up to remind him senior isn't this a bit against the rules onean how who was beside him FY have to intervene and said what rules are we talking about right now our team has unanimously agreed to follow the captain moreover ye who saved us earlier without him we would have died here today in terms of both reason and sentiment he deserves this reward the subordinate replied all right I was just asking casually he also understood the right and wrong in this matter thinking to himself of course I know that escaping from the illusion is something even the captain can't do so he is definitely not someone to be underestimated but with my hot-headed personality I like him clearly he has exceptional strength but pretends to be humble sooner or later I will have to exchange a few moves with you to see just what level your strength is at y Wu raised his thumb expressing his approval of ji Wang chuan's decision then smiled and said boss that's generous I have to like that I have one more thing to ask earlier when you defeated that boss goalkeeper did you drop a material called Zerg Essence if so could you sell it to me before he could finish his sentence the system notification popped up G Wang Chun gifts the treasure Zerg Essence to the host do you accept it Yu was truly surprised Captain G what is this ji Wang Chun replied it's nothing this is something you deserve I hope in the next battle you can continue to perform excellently yiu joyfully said of course thank you I'm really surprised I truly appreciate it regardless of his character or temperament just from the level of generosity ji Wang Chun is really trustworthy however Yu also felt a bit worried it seems they are not very interested in the items dropped from the boss could it be that the mo attack team has other objectives I hope they don't conflict with my goals Yu happily turned to ja ba and said what's up in the blink of an eye I've already collected two Zerg Essences next I just need to deal with one more boss and you can recover J Bal spoke with a tone full of appreciation um um y wo is amazing the next boss is the next boss is gabow was left speechless in horror causing y to be curious why you have an expression like you've seen a ghost who is the next boss after all gau's face shifted from Panic to worry it's it's my teacher yugu widened his eyes in Surprise teacher so even the insect is afraid of their teacher I get it sort of after all I've been been a relatively good student and have never been punished to copy homework giaba quickly interrupted that's not what I mean he's not an ordinary school teacher he's not only my sword skills instructor but is also known as the strongest sword Saint in the world the lone yiu clasped his hands in excitement sword sank the lone just hearing it sounds powerful I really want to meet him right away gabal hurriedly tried to stop him no no although you are indeed very strong if you meet my master you definitely won't be able to win the more he heard the more excited guu became is he that powerful could it be that his level is so high it's monstrous Jaa replied no the rank of my master is indeed a question mark But the source of a person's strength does not come from rank but from their Supreme sword skills Yu said in surprise when I heard you mention the sword Saint before I found it quite strange isn't your tribe always proud of physical strength I didn't expect there to be a master of Sword skills upon hearing Yu's question gabal had to explain further our tribe indeed does not excel in swordsmanship but my master is an exception because he is like you also a human hearing this Yi Wu was even more surprised what and this dungeon still hides such a story jiwan Chun who stood beside them also felt confused Yu grabbed giaba and asked further quickly tell me the details what exactly is this about Gaba giaba answered this is a story that my father told me before I was born a humanoid from another race suddenly broke into our world although the entire world was searching for him my master relied on his exceptional sword skills to break through in circulent multiple times however how long can a flesh and blood body contend against the whole world after many years my master gradually became exhausted and just as he was about to be tortured to death jila continued my father ultimately disregarded everyone's opinions and accepted the master assigning him the role of a close protector since my birth he has been both a bodyguard and a teacher of Sword skills for me at that time the master had truly integrated into the world of our race but after all humans in our race are still two different species the lifespan and aging of the two species are also not the same to extend his lifespan the master eventually took the risk of undergoing transformation to become the insect but one him proposed this transformation plan was actually my uncle therefore the master had no suspicions but my uncle secretly implanted toxic cells into the Master's body during the transformation process using these cells to control his nerves turning the master into a tool to kill my father giaba continued currently the master has completely lost his reason becoming a loyal servant of my uncle and also the most dangerous assassin if faced directly with him it would definitely be very dangerous upon hearing Jaa recount the whole situation yiu also understood that this opponent is truly very difficult to defeat indeed facing the insect alone for several decades a race with unparalleled strength and having undergone transformation to become even more powerful is a daunting challenge ye W thought like Senor and seong one cannot encounter an extremely powerful antagonist right from the beginning moreover his identity is a big mystery if he really is a human who suddenly intrudes then he would be like the original inhabitant of the dungeon just like Kai XA so what exactly is his background although I am very curious now is not the time to be troubled by this matter y Wu turned to Jaa and asked seriously if we kill your uncle will it remove the control over your master giaba pondered for a moment and replied it should work my uncle implanted his modified cells into my master to form a toxin which in turn controls my master as long as we killed him the toxin cells in my Master's body will stop activating Yu continued then we don't need to confront your master directly we can choose to take a detour around your master to destroy the lair first right seeing that Yu's plan was not bad giobi nodded in agreement okay we just need to take that secret passage at this moment Captain G eagerly interjected no no need to change the route that talking insect you we are heading straight to the location of your master sword Saint right now Jil was frightened and HIIT behind him soing who how could he possibly see me yiu was now very startled M clearly he didn't see me before so why can he suddenly See Me Now Captain G looked at the two of them and laughed loudly haha before that mental illusion appeared I saw this little bug that can speak human language following you the reason isn't important but what's important is what this bug is saying I can't pretend I didn't hear it Yu looked at Captain G in front of him feeling a bit curious could it be that you were also in that mental space and gained some ability if not achieving that just with your own abilities would really be terrifying y Wu turned to Pat Captain G on the shoulder and explained if you listen to what jaau said I fear that directly going to find the sword Saint right now might not be a smart choice of course I don't doubt your strength but our our ultimate goal is to defeat the boss it really isn't necessary to waste time on him yiu continued furthermore as long as we defeat the final boss this sword Saint won't self-destruct so it's really unnecessary Captain G couldn't wait any longer for yiu to analyze the situation and he drew his sword pointing it towards jaal who was hiding behind Yu stop wasting words tell it to lead the way or I'll kill it right now Juan how felt frustrated by G Wang chuan's attitude H why suddenly like this G don't be so impulsive weren't things good just a moment ago his subordinates were also surprised oh could it be that the senior has finally been provoked by this brat looks like there's a good show to watch haha Lu Fang despite knowing he wasn't a match for GW Chuan still spoke up to defend Yu what the hell do you want to do don't hurt my senior he silently told himself even if he kills me it's as easy is squashing an ant but I absolutely will not be cowardly y Wu remained unfazed his expression calm as he responded to Captain G's anger why do you need to act this way we just went through life and death trials together and now we've turned this into such an awkward atmosphere is that really good his gaze was filled with murderous intent as he looked at gal what if I want the answer do you know that we can't get past this barrier and still have to fight gabal stammered in response um I know I will lead you please don't harm me woo okay put down your sword G Wang Chu and immediately lowered his sword and ordered lead the way got it Gaba replied quickly then he shot up ahead yiu smiled touched to see that Gaba fearing for his safety had to point out the location of the master he told himself compared to my safety he should be more concerned about himself he truly is a wonderful person Lu Fang saw yiu standing still and hurriedly ran over to ask senior are you okay that onean how is truly outrageous how could he turn his back so quickly Juan how hearing this and not understanding the whole story curiously asked what just happened why provoke him like that another person also agreed that's right we should keep our distance from him seeing that even his younger sister advised him to keep his distance from ji Wang Chuan y wuo chuckled and explain to everyone it's fine I just know ahead there is a sword saint of the insect level extremely formidable what I mean is we should bypass him to avoid unnecessary casualties but Captain G stubbornly wants to go which is why there's a disagreement Juan how hearing this expressed some doubt about the information Yu had just relayed although I'm not clear how these two obtain such unreliable information if it Bears the title sword sand it's understandable for G to be restless Yi Wu curiously asked why you say that Juan how responded with a smile because of our captain don't be fooled by his cold demeanor he seems disinterested in anything in fact he is wholeheartedly devoted to researching sword skills and the saying goes The Undefeated will become increasingly lonely within the organization he seldom finds worthy opponents and has no one to discuss swordsmanship with therefore no matter who the opponent opponent it is as long as they wield a sword Captain G will personally engage in combat Juan how paused for a moment then continued with a smile but typically opponents can't last more than 30 seconds this time meeting a sword saint of the insect level is indeed something that captures his interest onean how continued I think in his heart he must be extremely excited I can even feel the held of his sword trembling with Joy Yi Wu understood the reason and also felt a bit of sympathy for G wine chuan's attitude just now I said he always prioritizes the mission so why has he changed this time turns out this is his true nature it seems G Wang Chun is also a swordsman perhaps he will choose to duel with the opponent later if someone is willing to lend a hand I won't refuse just standing by to watch the fun and being prepared in case things get out of control will be enough y Wu had these calculations in his mind how fortunate that g Wang Chuan is also gradually following the plan and he set out as he walked and thought about what was about to happen What a Feeling of anticipation and excitement this is it hasn't appeared for so long you must not disappoint me the lone sword Saint the lone sword Saint Gaba and Yu finally arrived at the destination jbal signaled it's right here Yu glanced around and felt this place has a strange atmosphere filled with chaotic sword energy and a chilling Aura of death as they ventured deeper inside they saw an old man sitting by a chessboard as if waiting for them that was the sword Saint the lone he looked at jaau and said you have finally returned I have been waiting for you for a long time J was emotional his voice choked Master the lone observed the unusual demeanor of his disciple as if understanding everything that gabal had gone through you were able to survive the Ambush and still dare to return to confront me like this you truly do not disappoint you are indeed the successor of the sword Saint now this chess board has been empty for far too long let us play a game together giaba shook his head sadly no I am no longer qualified to play chess with you regardless of my strength or before jabal could finish his sentence the sword Saint balone grasped the situation it makes sense who would want to play chess with the Enemy who killed their father moreover you are now nothing more than a pawn how can you be a player in this game Juan Hal fumed not understanding the conversation between the two is this old man talking to himself why can't I comprehend anything Yi Wu responded perhaps that is a default line from an NPC while Yi Wu explained to Juan how he had many questions in his mind I don't see any information about the race or symbol of the boss and even the level is just a question mark YW thought there are indeed many suspicious points about this sword Saint G Wang Chu rushed forward drw his sword and presented it in front of the loone the sword seemed to strike an invisible object letting out a soft sound before Vanishing nevertheless he maintained a calm demeanor as he continued with the chest move he was playing in contrast to the lon's calmness G Wang Chun appeared more anxious let's stop reminiscing about the past and draw your sword the lone looked up at G Wang Chuan and shook his head gently good sword but unfortunately I'm like a skeleton now with no fighting Spirit left the battlefield you seek is not here anger flashed in ji Wang chuan's eyes and he immediately launched an attack striking fiercely a swordsman without a sword does not need to exist theone also lost any intention of keeping the peace and responded sorry but I cannot die by your hand right now as he finished speaking gwan Chuan sword pierced The Sword in front of him the very sword he had drawn earlier isn't this the sword have drawn why does he keep insisting on drawing his sword repeatedly jiwang Chuan thought to himself is he trying to gather energy to condense his sword such ancient swordsmanship only exists in old texts G Wang Chuan tried to remain calm fiercely resisting you want to use this to force me to retreat from my attack right just with these tattered swords it'll take a long time now take my strike a sword that cannot be held firmly in hand is nothing but a piece of you useless metal except my move the lone smiled and said well done well done it has been hundreds of years since I have seen such a powerful sword technique if it were me from before I surely would not be able to resist wanting to clash with you but now the rest of my life is lived for just one purpose Juan how stood up preventing anyone from getting close to the ancient sword of the loone that was firmly embedded in the ground before him the loone turned to look at gabal then this is the sword I used to kill your father take it while I can still suppress the poison in my body when the time comes you take your revenge and wash away your grievances it will also be seen as helping me fulfill my wish gabal cried out in pain saying no I can't killing father was not the Master's intention he was just being controlled I don't hate you the lone looked at his disciple with a sympathetic gaze child you are good at everything but you are too kind-hearted you truly resemble your father however relying solely on kindness cannot make you a ruler of a clan if you do not have the determination to step Over My Dead Body it would be best to give up the idea of avenging your uncle yatted giia Bow's head softly comforting what your master said is indeed true you need to overcome this hardship however before doing that Yu quickly stepped forward standing opposite the loan and said senior I have something I want to ask I have heard that you were originally a human so could you tell me which era you are from how did you come to this world the lone looked ye woo up and down that nodded and replied young man you are truly peculiar to ask me which era I am from our first meeting but the mark on you clearly shows that gioa trusts you greatly very well it has been a long time since I thought about the past it won't hurt to tell you he pondered for a moment before recounting it was a Rainy Night hundreds of years ago after countless hardships I finally found the enemy who killed my entire family they were numerous but I had a sword in hand and that was enough he continued after battling with a group of people in the end only I and he remained he was also a master swordsman but my sword was still faster just as I finished my revenge a bolt of lightning suddenly struck my sword causing me to lose Consciousness immediately when I woke up I found myself in this place the entire world around me was filled with Strang looking monsters apart from myself you are the only humans I have encountered this is my story now had your curiosity been satisfied young man Yu listen to the story while trying to gather information damn it this amount of information is a bit overwhelming this is basically a time travel narrative isn't it I remember that a few Scholars have summarized about the chaotic Dimensions the online era of Earth could also be called a global time travel event or a global chaotic dimension in ancient times there were small scale personal time travels and now it's directly into the dungeon how chaotic is this Dimension after all he thought further moreover is this chaos random or caused by humans in academic circles people only talk about it but there has been no conclusion one person in the group turned to G wine chewan his eyes brightening and said excitedly it feels like we just heard some explosive news doesn't it another person replied if that's the case humans from hundreds of years ago traveling through time and becoming insect people such a thing has never been heard of when we return we must immediately report to the headquarters giwan Chun pondered is it really possible to harvest something like this this may also confirm some speculations of the leadership that thing must be in this Holy Temple suddenly a rustling sound came from above the lone frowned you said too much already the loan everyone's attention shifted upward is that sound coming from the swarm of insects above immediately kill all these Intruders including that weakling his voice resounded the lone gradually approached him predicting what was about to happen while still conscious she desperately tried to say for many years besides waiting for death I have been continuously cultivating to resist the poison in my body but unfortunately despite trying every method I still couldn't do it he replied that's only natural although you have undergone insect transformation you are still a human how could you possibly resist the profound advantages of our insects enough I command you to kill them under his command the lone screamed in despair jaau was extremely frightened and intended to fly closer Master the loan immediately transformed into a bizarre shape he reassured my purpose is not to resist but to retain a bit of Consciousness when the insect transformation is activated to everyone's astonishment the lone transformed into a shape resembling a spider with sharp legs he was taken aback by his words what this is impossible I have waited for this moment for so long finally it has come while still conscious balone broke one of his legs and stabbed it straight into his chest the insect demon screamed what are you doing the LOM could it be in the astonishment of all the lone pulled out a shimmering blue Zerg Essence from his chest he said the Zerg Essence in my body can only be fully activated after the insect transformation The Lone struggled to take each step towards Jaa handing over the essence and instructing take this giobal this is the final inheritance I bestow upon you giobal looked at the precious gift his heart filled with sorrow and hesitated to accept it he knew this was a gift that Master had to sacri sacrifice his life to pass on seeing the disciples still hesitating the lone urged you can use this Zerg Essence when you restore your original form you will have enough power to kill me very decisively he quickly threw the Zerg Essence towards his disciple giobal with red eyes trembling and stammering said master I can't do it I can't lay a hand on the master the lone expressed disappointment sadly saying is that so well then if we Ness and kindness are the path you choose the master will still support you however I can no longer walk this path with you now hurry and run away as far as you can I have written everything down now go guide for me this time I will not lift the poison control again you will forever become my strongest one after saying that the loone accept it to fight gwang Chuan in the end you still took the initiative to attack huh although I regret not being able to truly spar with this human form it doesn't matter as long as I can wield a sword it's still worth having a fight the lone replied is that so you must be the strongest among this Bunch right but here in my eyes you are no different from trash if you are so eager to die then I will start with you one of G1 chuan's men angrily said damn it your arrogance is too much isn't it just a boss we've faced countless bosses before let's kill him together Juan how said although I say this I guess Juan how also intended to express his own guesses but was interrupted by GW Chuan everyone step back although There Are Rules given priority to Mission over personal matters a master of Sword skills like this is a rare occurrence and I don't want to miss the opportunity for a one-on-one with him you must not interfere Juan how saw the captain make such a decision and felt it was somewhat unlike him before but he could only think to himself and did not dare to speak up ah I still understand you G but this is the first time I see you ignore the rules and prioritize the mission you're not being influenced by that brat yo are you gwang Chun charged forward alone executing his next move he did not forget to remind everyone step back a little be careful not to get hurt accidentally the lone looked at G1 chewing puzzled what peculiar technique is this aren't you going to compare sword skills with me where is your sword giwan Chu and laughed heartily haha you are now just a bug holding a sword Unworthy of matching sword skills with me it turned out the captain had been recognized by the lone as using the essence wind God domain technique although the two sides did not directly duel with swords there were sounds of clashing like swords striking against each other hemp this type of attack method the loan was focused on commanding a certain technique G Wang Chun stood in front of the gentle breed his gaze observing meticulously use sword into key and shift the kai into the air where the wind is everywhere the Lan was very interested in this battle interesting haha this is really too interesting I will join you in this fight the subordinate of Captain G looked at his Superior with pride truly worthy of being the strongest technique of the senior suppressing the one called The Sword sank to the point of being unable to Counterattack Juan how had a different thought the situation seems to be one-sided in suppression but there is no real damage to the sword saand could it be that he can block most of the attacks how is this possible Yu also silently pondered this technique of ji Wang Chu is indeed very powerful but it must have time limitations judging from the current situation the sword Saints transformation can hold out until the skill ends and he must take advantage of this time to replenish his combat power Yi Wu turned around and saw jaau still clutching the Zerg Essence and crying which made him feel uncomfortable Stop Standing There crying quickly absorb this Zerg Essence for me then restore your previous form as he spoke he tried to force it into jaau regardless of the struggles to avoid it no I can't do it ywu said sternly can't do it then I will kill you right now because the person I hate the most is the weakling who drags others down I have tolerated you for too long don't think I will always protect you after all if I kill you I can become the king of this entire world and your mother I won't care about her letting her continue to be tormented hearing Yu's provocation and thinking of his mother Jal suddenly awakened and shouted what you were not allowed to treat my mother like that giaba regained his composure his expression emotional as he said I know I am very weak especially since I met you I feel like I can rely on you without having to fight but my strength has also recognized by the master I may not be as useless as this perhaps I just lacked determination as he spoke Joba grabbed the Zerg Essence to absorb it then looked at y Wu and quietly thanked him thank you for intentionally using this method to scare me jal's body has begun to encase itself yiu deliberately turned away soaking but in her heart it felt as though she had shed the burden of giobal who's performing don't think randomly you say you're very strong so hurry up and transform for me to see hemp Yu felt a bit embarrassed when she saw that jabal had completely understood her provocative intention is that with such poor acting skills giobal simply nodded affirming wait for me yiu felt very anxious while waiting for this weakling to return to his original form did you already encase yourself after just one disagreement the problem is I don't know how long it will take to break out I don't have much time to wait for you so you better come out soon Yu said it's here GW Chuan was using the wind Lord sword formation strategy confidently fighting but unexpectedly just one move from the loone shattered everything the Beast seemed to blend into one haha I've adapted to your attack methods already no wonder the body of the sword Saint is so formidable even without Zerg Essence it can be this strong those witnessing were tense holding their breath as they watched every move so the actually shattered the wind Lord sword formation of the senior ji Wang Chuan heard those words and became even more worried the opponent is truly too strong in the wind Lord realm I can only fight him on equal terms if he does a weaken by himself I would definitely lose given the current situation I can't possibly defeat him in the allotted time by the time the wind Lord realm dissipates I will have 5 Seconds of weakness if he seizes that opportunity the entire team will be in danger should I use that move the move I intended to hold back for the final boss seeing G wangchu distracted the lone spoke up in a battle of this caliber are you still daring to lose focus you are already dead saying that he raised his sword preparing to deliver an even stronger blow than before it's over Captain G turned to Yu with a pleading look fortunately y Wu managed to rush in to block that fatal strike just in time he said the the attack power is indeed strong but I can barely withstand it giwan Chuan upon seeing this shouted loudly Le woo what are you doing you are charging into my windl realm do you not want to live anymore y wo is trying to resist while saying to G Wang Chuan so please Captain G quickly withdraw the formation I'm struggling to hold it back next let me fight it seeing that there was no other choice Captain G was still quite worried about Yu he wanted to confirm once more are you sure you want to fight it Yu replied firmly absolutely Captain G you should conserve your energy after all there's still a final boss we haven't fought yet besides don't you want to probe my true abilities now I will show you my real strength of course I was just fooling you on the outside youu pretended to want to relieve the captain but inside he truly didn't want him to know the full extent of his power the lone suddenly saw another opponent appear and sneered what's this can't handle it alone so you start calling for reinforcements I don't mind you all can come and me together this level 13 little boy in front of me is not worthy of fighting me Yi Wu confidently replied winning we're losing we have to fight to find out come here he raised his index finger to provoke his opponent the loone shot four Swords at y Wu confidently and disdainfully saying this guy doesn't know his own limits killing you will be a piece of cake y woo with just one sword strike had cut down all four of those swords he looked at the loone and said is that all although my sword skills may not be as formidable as yours this method of attack seems a bit weak unknowingly the lone had moved behind Yu he simply replied it's just a Fain attack don't get too proud I'm not foolish enough to underestimate any opponent on the battlefield Yu responded no wonder you are master of seizing power and strategy having said that he shot backwards and proclaimed loudly I almost fell for your trick the lone exclaimed in surprise you could shoot backwards didn't you say you didn't know sword skills yiu turned around to face him and said I only said I wasn't proficient not that I didn't know at all moreover after utilizing the backward shock to seize the opportunity to attack that is basic knowledge after that he wildly slashed towards the loone the LOM again brought forward his swords to block the blows from ywo he also responded this is not a matter of knowledge or not the fact that you can withstand my force is enough to show how strong you are suddenly he thrust the branches from the ground upward but y wo quickly dodged he asked wasn't it said that we would duel with swords why are we starting a sneak attack now he looked at Yu who was slicing the thick branches he had thrust up from the ground and said I am not theone the rules of your kind against this insects are just a joke as long as I can win I will use any means necessary since he had broken the agreement ye Wu no longer needed to hold back he replied to win without Scruples sounds like my style then I won't hold back either since I have already drawn my sword he shouted I prefer violence even more than this ye woo activated flame demon control and violet fists emerg from the magical circles targeting the loan with attacks hit by a Flurry of Blows he shouted impossible how can a human possess such strength those standing outside watching Yu's power against the lone whispered among themselves Juan how said I knew this kid was not simple observing the might radiating from him another person commented his true level must be at least level 120 another person added I told you he has Primal power within him but you didn't believe l said could this strange black purple flaming makeer be a fusion of Shadow attributes and fire attributes the man with purple hair also said hemp so you finally reveal your true abilities G wine cheu and thought to himself his real level is definitely not just 120 the attack power he is showing now likely fluctuates around 130 to 150 this is the reason for his confidence isn't it no wonder he always maintains a calm and unflustered demeanor this person can only be recruited if we want to kill him it will be very difficult the person was still enduring the attacks from y woo loudly shouting enough already this endless entanglement is pointless if it weren't for that damn the loone abandoning the Zerg Essence I would have long since killed all of you even though I find it hard to determine a winner in a one-on-one you are not without weaknesses which is what you humans often refer to as burdens as soon as he finished speaking he split into multiple copies and continued even if I cannot kill you it is very easy to kill the others which option do you want to choose in the end he burst into laughter one person from gwne chuan's team who was blocking an attack from one of the copies shouted a signal to everyone be careful even though the strength of this clone is not as strong as the main body it should not be underestimated quickly deal with them the person with purple hair also rushed over to assist the other and said yes Yu is indeed an outer disciple if he has such crushing power then why does he still want to give the boss a chance to transfer Lulu standing behind to support the two spoke up because yiwu's strength is not strong enough to truly overwhelm shut up and focus on fighting Juan how who was dealing with another Avatar chimed in wwu's subordinates should quickly hide behind me if you run into this avadar there's only one path to death l F replied loudly understood Brother Juan Yun Fay turned to the back and said Kai XI you stay close to me then she saw Kix facing an avatar alone and anxiously yelled k x suddenly G Wang cheu and dashed in like the wind counterattacking the Avatar in front of kayaki causing it to fall he said even if your strength is weak you should at least know how to run away gwang Chun used Swift slashes to dismember the avatar into many pieces then turned around to say to kxi did y Wu not teach you how to face an enemy stronger than yourselves kaixi stammered I'm I'm sorry suddenly G wangchu felt something unusual furrowing his brows and thought is it that enhancement effect again moreover this time the feeling is even stronger than before could it be he abruptly grabbed Kai XA and pulled her close to him kexi was startled and exclaimed what do you what do you want to do he paid no attention to her words and continued to ponder indeed this is because of this girl could this be some kind of passive skill of hers I have never encountered a situation like this before Kai kxi struggled to raise her hand softly saying please please let me go suddenly he released Kai XA and ran towards another clone G wangchu and thought to himself this is not the time to doubt this I need to eliminate the Clones first kaixi watched him run away silently thinking this man is truly strange on yiu side he was still enthusiastically fighting the lone and said just G Wang Chun alone can eliminate all your clones it seems your clone strategy is useless theone replied is that so I don't rely solely on clones to fight they are merely a diversion to attract your attention as for my true objective suddenly a large tree burst forth from the ground the lone gleefully said look up and see this is the death you all must face ywu shouted to announce not good it's insect poison again everyone hurry theone was very pleased to have distracted them laughing as he said too late now you won't Escape haha accompanying the lon's laughter were the explosive sounds of the green foliage releasing a green gas the toxic smoke spread around causing y Wu to kneel down covering his mouth and nose he thought to himself carelessness has led me to fall into two traps in a row in an environment like the holy Templar here it's truly impossible to be on guard fortunately I was prepared in advance coughing yeu struggled to tell everyone everyone hurry and take the antidote that I prepared for you all one how raised the vial to his mouth and drank he silently thanked y wo thank goodness for y woo without the antidote ready I would have surely died Lulu also drank the antidote while saying but this poison is stronger than the previous toxin the effectiveness of the antidote has also diminished the loan not expecting this exclaimed you all prepared an antidote the loan continued you have some brains but they're useless this is my territory and I can use all the resources to eliminate you thus you will die regardless gwan Chuan had weakened considerably but still forced himself to speak even if I have only 40% of my attributes left I can still drag you down with me the L mockingly asked him are you saying that just based on your shaky appearance are you joking G Chuan did not turn his head but spoke with his actions I stubbornly wanted to come here I take full responsibility for the mission's failure I can sacrifice myself in the end to drag you down you guys take the chance to escape Lulu loudly disagreed and advised no if I'm not by your side pity him after using that move you'll lose your life too the lonely ignored their concern for each other's lives and lunged to attack G wi Chuan saying you don't need to be considerate of each other after all it's just a matter of when you die G wine Chun cornered him forcing the loan to stumble back suddenly something in front of him shattered and the loone recognized it saying this sword energy belongs to jaau jaaba stepped forward and said sorry to keep you waiting I'll take it from here y Wu was supporting Yan fi and looked at Joba with a smile saying little boy you showed up just in time this skill of posturing is truly a chew and Chang from me but I will only exert 90% the final 10% depends on your real abilities the lone also looked at Gaba with a contemptuous gaze the sneak attack just now wasn't bad but you haven't seize the opportunity to seriously injure me it seems that even if you returned to your original form you were still just a waste jbal paid no attention to the lon's words stepping forward with his sword and saying Master Your Will and strength I have comprehended fully the disciple will certainly follow your teachings cast aside weakness and hesitation and fulfill the Revenge without bringing shame upon the master hearing this the lone responded loudly very good now I will let you go to your death you must obediently stand there and listen to your master J glared at him and said you have no right to claim to be my master immediately giaba repeatedly slashed his sword at the loan the loan screamed in pain a how dare you do this to the body of your master jaau replied don't worry master I will definitely expel the evil from your body quickly please rest assured after that the lone soared up executing the blade storm technique in astonishment and anger he exclaimed damn it why has a useless person like you suddenly become so strong he said in the past I didn't even have the courage to wield a sword however this ends here if the poison affects you then you will die under the sword skills that your master cherishes the most jaau observed the situation and judged it seems that you are merely usurping the Master's body you fundamentally do not understand sword skills blad storm is a defensive technique that condenses the sword energy while the real lethal attack is this after saying that jabal thrust his sword forward executing a technique causing Flames to ignite around his sword then jaau unleashed the esoteric technique lone heart Overlord slash he was attacked but couldn't evade it helplessly enduring the blow while shouting damn a suddenly everything around shook producing loud sounds someone shouted it's an earthquake the rocks and stones began to crack and fall apart Yi Wu stood to one side along with yi yan who was holding on to his hand Yi Wu exclaimed damn this kid is really formidable this strike has made the very essence of the Holy Temple feel pain starting to emit low groans Juan how standing nearby also said so this kid who suddenly appeared truly has some background just by looking at the power of his sword skills it can be guessed that he has surpassed Brother G Yi Wu replied it's a long story I will explain it to you later the lone along with many incarnations floating in the air said to jabal this body is known to be the strongest in the insect realm I can easily subdue a useless piece of trash like you surely you have absorbed its Zerg Essence which is why you have become so powerful as long as I rupture your abdomen and extract the Zerg Essence I won't need to let you speak another word gabal immediately used the Phantom Shadow chain sword technique swiftly cutting through all of the lon's incarnations causing the lone to scream in pain finally giaba said I will not allow you to achieve your goal I will fiercely protect the inheritance of the master jiwan Chun looked at him seriously thinking to himself this insect kid is indeed very powerful just as his master said now having obtained The Inheritance and breaking through his mental demons he has become overwhelmingly strong even if I were not poison and did not need to use my strongest move I would absolutely have no chance of winning against him suddenly the lone changed his demeanor staggering backward raising his hands in a gesture of surrender theone said all right I concede you have won I truly did not expect you to be this formidable in consideration of our relationship as uncle and nephew please come back and assist me the loan continued replying I will also release your mother so that the two of you can reunite how about that giaba rushed forward and said to him the me from before might have believed that but the me now will not be swayed by sweet words anymore my only goal is to kill you suddenly several Vines shot up from the ground wrapping tightly around gau's legs preventing him from moving Joba was taken aback turned his head to look and exclaimed immediately the lon's expression changed like flipping a pancake laughing and saying haha congratulations you guessed right but it's too late I never intended to give up this body after all it is the culmination of my hard work but now it seems that if I don't give it up I won't be able to defeat you in the situation where he was bound tightly by The Vines giobal shouted what do you ultimately want to do the lone merging with the Holy Temple laughed loudly and said haha feeling desperate now because you will All Die Here immediately at that moment a tree began to grow wildly at an astonishing speed a person exclaimed in Panic it's committing suicide giaba replied no it is merging the body of the master and the ancient tree then using the energy of the Holy Temple to biotransform the ancient tree but by doing so the ulate goal is jabal hadn't finished peing when the branches as sharp as sword suddenly sprouted out someone exclaimed the branches are growing sharp like swords another person quickly spoke up you all hurry and run towards the exit I will hold them here yet another person yelled it's not good the exit is blocked by the growing branches is this its purpose another added it's trapping Us in this space that keeps shrinking then letting us be pierced to death someone angrily said damn it our attributes are weakened and we haven't recovered how can we get past these branches blocking the exit Joba spoke seriously no these branches are absorbing the energy of the Holy Temple we fundamentally cannot completely cut them down we need to think of another way ji Wang Chu and said in a deep voice to stop its growth we must cut off the connection between the main trunk of the ancient tree and the Holy Temple but now we are forced into this corner we cannot pinpoint the exact location of the main trunk giow replied finding the location of the main trunk is not difficult I just need to use the Supreme meaning that the master imparted to me I can bypass the spatial distance to strike but it requires 10 seconds to concentrate my strength given the current situation it's fundamentally impossible to accomplish Yi Wu immediately said since we have a final trump card why didn't you mention it earlier ye Wu continued I will take advantage of these 10 seconds although all my attributes are weakened my props will not be affected using these lightning Shields is enough to bias 10 seconds everyone come close to me the 10 seconds began to pass and the energy Shield started to multiply by five one how said you're impressive y woo but the level of this protective shield isn't very high can it really hold up YW replied according to my calculations it should be just enough to withstand for 10 seconds Juan how exclaimed what just enough the energy Shield multiplied by four but the shield began to crack someone shouted we actually put our lives in the hands of a little insect this is too crazy the energy Shield multiplied by two J bow prepared to unleash his technique a person shouted loudly hey little insect don't let us down the energy Shield was depleted the final layer of protection was broken someone reminded loudly The Shield is gone little insect hurry jilaba stood in a posture identical to his master and shed the profound meaning of the lone swordsmanship is with just one move ultimate profound meaning Eternal Annihilation everything was sliced in into countless pieces the sound of the sword echoed loudly causing the entire space to seem like it was cracking someone exclaimed in Surprise damn it this sword technique not only cuts through the ancient tree but also shatters space it's incredible baby Beetle replied this is the ultimate killing move that my master has trained to Perfection it's the first time I've Unleashed this technique and fortunately it manifested flawlessly not bringing shame to the title of Sword SA theone hearing that Yu became Furious smacked baby Beetle on the head and shouted damn it are you using all our lives to practice if you fail even as a ghost you won't be spared baby Beetle quickly soothed wasn't there room for failure who it hurts too much suddenly someone yelled hey look over there everyone turned to look in the direction One H pointed seeing a figure radiating Brilliance floating in the air baby beagle looked up and recognized that familiar silhouette saying the body of my master has returned he ran over and tightly embraced the true body of the loone emotionally saying I never expected it to be so perfect I've retrieved my Master's remains you can rest in peace now baby Beetle held his master now wrapped in a cocoon and said to Y woo once everything is over I want to bury my master in the place where you once traveled through time yiu replied all right I will go with you wine Chun looked at baby Beal and said I didn't expect you to evolve into such a powerful form in such a short time from a biological perspective maybe you really are superior to humans you don't need to be too sorrowful The Inheritance that a master has learned throughout his life is already perfect your strength does not shame the title of Sword Saint baby Beetle gently replied thank you you who listened to the conversation between the two of them and thought to himself I didn't expect G Wang Chuan to be able to comfort others like that it seems he really recognizes baby Beal ji Wang Chu walked past baby Beal and continued next we could travel together and I will conveniently help you get your revenge but the price is that after it's done you must have a duel with me baby Beetle replied to be able to spar with a master like you is my honor y Wu thought to himself this G Wang Chuan is really a martial arts fanatic his mind is only filled with thoughts of sword fighting suddenly Yun F stepped forward from somewhere excitedly asking brother where did you find this treasure it's amazing Yi Wu looked at his little sister and laughed helplessly saying well the baby beetle is not a pet like sha long seeing y yam looking at him the baby Beetle approached knelt down gently took her hand and politely kissed it he said Dear Miss beautiful you are y Wu's little sister right I am the baby be the Prince of the insect species previously harmed and imprisoned it was thanks to Yu's rescue that I could once again see the sunlight I hope to learn from you due to the baby beetles actions y Yan F unexpectedly blushed and exclaimed a ywo angrily punched the baby Beal in the face and shouted little boy you have a lot of nerve who gave you permission to kiss my sister the baby Beetle after being hit hubbed his head and cried I'm sorry I'm I'm sorry suddenly a screen appeared and the person connecting was lag jasai he said sternly black attack combat team do you hear me there's an emergency situation G wi chew and asked what's going on Li jasai liai replied just now Zulu from Wong Jang looked extremely angry and charged into the Holy Temple we could not stop her you all need to be careful hearing this yiu felt as if struck by lightning and thought damn it could she be coming to seek revenge on me moreover it's faster than I expected ye W continued although my strength is now enough to deal with her a woman who is tough when angry is really unpredictable what should we do now let's get out of here first but before that he anxiously looked at the loot and said Captain G we should quickly take the loot and leave this place if not when she charges over later we definitely won't be able to avoid a fierce battle ji Wang Chun replied the boss was defeated by the baby Beetle the loot belongs to you guys I only need the black slate Yu gave a thumbs up and smiled Captain you are really generous but I guess you have something more in mind he wondered to himself the black slate didn't the sandstorm Incubus drop a piece earlier could it be that the real purpose of this trip for G chwan group is to collect the black slate pieces the system displayed a message congratulations to the host for defeating the boss receiving 5 million experience points the experience points will be evenly distributed among all team members along with 5 million gold coins and 50 Epic Level magic crystals this loot includes the absolute sword streamer black wetstone sword Saints swordsmanship book beginner to Advanced levels broken black slate and old and Rusty Kei Yi Wu grabbed the black stone Brew it to jiwang Chuan and said here this is the stone you wanted G Wang Chun caught the stone and replied yeah I found the sword Manual of the sword saying among the loot you can study it a bit in the future when your swordsmanship advances we might even have a bit of a contest y Wu helplessly smiled thinking to himself forget it I don't want to be entangled with a fighter like you after that he turned around and started to walk away but not forgetting to urge everyone let's quickly depart to the final boss location Although our weaken state has been resolved we still have a countdown to death hanging over us so we need to hasten our Pace ywu thought to himself even though my current Shadow flame form can surpass level 160 in combat Sulu definitely had some trump card up her sleeve facing her will definitely not yield any benefits as he was walking yiu suddenly saw two streaks of green light rushing towards him when he was not on guard baby beagle and G Wang Chuan immediately rushed the block one of them shouted who dares to Ambush y Wu Sulu with a fierce Aura Advanced and said finally I found you g Wang Chu and stood in front of her and replied so you finally made your move he continued but it's too late to steal the boss now Sulu sneered in response boss I'm not interested in the boss or this dungeon my purpose for coming here is only one immediately Zulu's killing int interrupted she shouted I already said anyone who dares to deceive me will only have one outcome y Wu scratched his head smiling brightly and said Miss beautiful please calm down although I indeed deceived you it was out of kindness to be precise you should thank me if I hadn't kindly deceived you in returning you might have been pursued and punished by The Hang Jen Group after all you did leave your position without permission right without allowing yiu to say anything further Zulu immediately shot the ice swords she had prepared towards him she yelled stop talking I will never forgive anyone who dares to deceive me today you must die instantly GW Chun also drove his sword ready to fight he slashed the ice swords all over the place and clearly stated Yi Wu is now a member of our Mo attack team do you think it's that easy to touch him he continued if you want to kill him you have to go through my door first baby Beetle immediately chimed in that's right I absolutely won't let you touch even a single hair on y woo onean how also added if the Senor has made his stance clear how can we just stand by and watch let's Go Brothers another person in the team said this female disciple really has no sense let me go up and test her strength Lulu interjected being a woman who is prouder than cold like that just makes people hate you more be careful you might not even get married in this lifetime the one with purple hair spoke up as well V woo you should thank the captain although I'm too lazy to care about your life or death since the captain has spoken I must exert a little effort Sulu was so angry that she almost laughed she reached for her sword and said good if you all want to stand up for him then I'll kill you all unexpectedly ywu immediately moved right in front of Sulu blocking her hand and said wait goddess this is just a grudge between the two of us no need to involve others Sulu was slightly taken aback and quietly marveled his speed is too fast even I almost couldn't see it Yu continued moreover in fact we don't have any deep-seated hatred between us yiu continued I admit that I lur the Bots to hang Jen's base but you also lured the Bots way to deal with hano's base while I brought them to hang jenk base both of us are performing very normal tactical Maneuvers after all both sides are in a hostile situation Sulu firmly replied don't use that ridiculous logic to cover up these are two completely different matters yiu placed one hand on his chest and the other on his forehead pretending to be in anguish no this is indeed one matter and moreover I was forced into it initially I didn't want to get involved in the struggle for interests between the two large corporations but due to a small incident I was listed as a secondary Target on Wang Jen groot's Bounty list and they sent people to hunt me down multiple times should I just let them kill me without doing anything therefore retaliating a little is quite reasonable right suu upon hearing this appeared surprised I didn't expect there to be a conflict between you and Wong Jen group but I suspect you are lying as I have never heard about any Bounty list within the corporation y Wu chuckled inwardly thinking to himself oh it seems this bounty list hasn't been made public for Kulu to know about amaz mediately he seized upon this point to continue what ye who continued you're the top combat force of Wong Jang yet you don't know about that Bounty list it's a list published specifically for Mercenaries and bounty hunters after that he clapped his hands together and said that's right the person at the top of the list right before me shares the same surname as you their name is sui what a coincidence T upon hearing this Sulu was immediately taken back Yu secretly felt pleased thinking he bingo I knew you two were connected Yu pretended to be indifferent and continued by the way speaking of sui she was in the same school as me previously when the monster attacked the city we had a chance encounter once I wonder how she ended up on Wong jang's list of prime targets Sulu curiously asked so do you know where she is now y replied I don't know after that incident we haven't seen each other again but why are you asking about this do you happen to know her she responded it's nothing just asking casually all right I'll continue the matter between you and me has nothing to do with wam Jang so don't bring up unrelated topics to avoid the subject y Wu calmly said if you take action now it will only give the insect species the opportunity to take advantage of us and suffer Mutual damage instead let's work together to defeat the final boss first and then we'll set our personal grievances when we get outside y Wu thought silently it's you who is avoiding the topic you two definitely have a connection she retorted no way with someone as Sly as you if I give you the chance I'm afraid you'll disappear Without a Trace therefore I must deal with you right here Juan how couldn't take it any longer and shouted angrily I really can't listen to this anymore he felt she was looking down on everyone just because she had a higher level if I don't give her a couple of punches she probably wouldn't even know what it means to be reasonable Wang Chuan intervened saying don't make a scene anymore haven't you noticed Yu's demeanor is different now he continued even facing someone at level 140 is no problem for her that kid has become stronger again Juan how was surprised what although he just leveled up three times there's no way he could be unafraid of someone at level 140 right looking at Yu he asked so what exactly do you want I feel that whatever you want to do should be done quickly after all the longer we stay here the more dangerous it will become she replied it's very simple I want you to take three of my sword strikes you can Dodge or defend after three strikes regardless of whether you live or die our grudges will be wiped clean he enthusiastically said three strikes to settle our grudges fine no problem y y wo younger sister worryingly said no way brother that girl is level 140 it's too dangerous let me help you Yi Wu reassured his sister don't worry trust me you all step back a bit definitely don't get hurt he continued come on please teach me Sulu calmly with a slightly disdainful expression launched her attack how can you be so calm then I will use 80% of my strength first to see if you truly have ability or just putting on a shell y Wu calmly parried and thought of himself the innate defensive Talent indeed cannot block everything I cannot underestimate her strength after that he counterattacked surprising susulu she was shocked thinking 80% of my strength only took away 20% of his health it seems underestimated y woo if that's the case there's no need to hold back my strength anymore yiu confidently said I've learned from this first strike please continue later he was surprised to see CIU using the demon Crystal skill in the Malle form of the ice goddess he shouted what the hell could it be that just because of an inappropriate word she immediately unleashes a big move Juan how exclaimed in Surprise damn it she really wants to kill y wo G only you can take action now to stop this crazy woman if we go out there it's just looking for death Wang Chun replied I'm not sure I can stop her either more importantly I'm curious to see how y woo will respond Juan Hal skeptically asked are you serious he continued facing such a significant level Gap and still being confident to engage I think he definitely has his own way to deal with it let's just wait and see in his heart he silently thought on the surface it looks like he has increased three levels but it's definitely not that simple what other Secrets does this kid have Yun Fe anxiously gried baby Beetle's hand pleading for help for her brother she said please help my brother that girl is too strong I'm afraid you won't be able to hold out baby Bea replied I'm sorry I can't do that this is Yu's own choice I can't undermine a man's courage and determination moreover I believe YW definitely has a way to deal with it heulu confidently Unleashed her ultimate move Eternal ice violence slash challenging if you have the guts then show me another strike Yu was not one to back down either using his ultimate technique inflammation of the demon barrier halfbody statue he replied the chaien emperor unlocks the dark attribute and the power of demon barrier inflammation is significantly enhanced now let's see just how powerful the half-body demon has become as you wish I will take your strike Wang Chu immediately rushed in to Shield his teammate reassuring calm down G this scale of fighting has exceeded our defensive capabilities juanell grumbled damn it if you two want to flirt just go ahead don't drive us into it Yu was surprised to take a massive amount of damage he exclaimed in disbelief one strike took away 60% of my health it was already a struggle to withstand that blow this woman truly is the strongest in hang Jen what's frightening is that she still seems to be holding back the next blow will surely be her all out effort I must seize the right moment to activate Shadow King and save myself exhausted Yi Wu continued Bring it on I will make use of this time No more healing I will use the remaining 20% of my health to take your final strike if you want to vent your anger feel free Yun Fay anxiously shouted brother what are you talking about if you continue like this you will be in danger Lu Fang also added that's right senior while I believe you definitely have countermeasures not restoring health is a bit excessive members of the Special Forces team took turns commenting has ye wo gone mad anyone with sharp eyes can tell that Kulu still has stronger lethal moves she hasn't used with his current health there's no way he can withstand it in a life and death challenge like this acting tough this kid is either really foolish or hiding some trump card that can turn the tide regardless it looks like there will be a good show to watch haha Zulu unexpectedly she sword and said let's stop here for today you would asked in Surprise why suddenly stop fighting you don't need to hold back I can still take it she said with a tone of admiration although my first strike was indeed a bit dismissive the second strike used a killing move if you can withstand it it shows you have strength comparable to mine I am angry because I hate being deceived by a weaker opponent however if it's based on strength and you're playing tricks like this I won't hold a grudge she slowly approached closer her gaze probing moreover looking at your calm demeanor you probably have some hidden killing moves that you haven't used yet right y Wu cheerfully replied he we're the same in this regard he thought to himself of course it would be best not to use it life is tough making money isn't easy I'm grateful to her for helping me save a significant amount of money Sulu turned to leave and said what happened between us is white clean what you guys want to do next has nothing to do with me Yu called after her wait he added although you have given up your rights I have always said that a debt could be claimed at any time he thought to himself this woman may be a bit hot-tempered but she still has principles plus with her ambiguous relationship with Wang Jang if I don't connect with her a bit it would truly be a waste Sulu smiled I didn't expect someone like you who has a big mouth to actually have some principles if you are sincere like this I will remember this promise goodbye right after that everyone was taken a back when they felt the Tremor what is happening is there an earthquake again it seems the main body of this Holy Temple is becoming increasingly impatient Lu Fang added this is not good the exit of this space suddenly closed by itself it looks horrifying like blood clots after an injury and the structures on it are riddling how are we going to get out this time Lulu discovered a A New Path she pointed ahead and said this way opens up to an unclear Road looking through it seems very suspicious her teammate replied it really feels like hitting back at oneself is there something waiting for us in here Yu turned to ask baby Beetle what is this path where does it lead to Baby Beetle answered it is very likely that uncle has changed the structure of the road of the Holy Temple because this Holy Temple was originally built within the body of an ancient Zerg that is sleeping soundly and Uncle can use the power of kingship to control it onean how excitedly said if the final boss has this ability wouldn't we be like fish in a barrel he just needs to set up the maze paths to toy with us why Chu and calmly replied this type of ability must have some limitations otherwise he would have done it long ago it is also possible that he underestimated us before and is only starting to take us seriously now Yu with a confident and fearless expression said no matter what traps lie ahead in short we must step in to uncover the truth baby Beetle also agreed that's right my sensory abilities are top-notch with me here there's no need to fear any traps at the same time a mysterious voice spoke up you don't need to be afraid from the darkness he Ming way and alter steep forward alter said ahead is a straight path to the main Palace of the Holy Temple there are no traps at all wne Chuan got into a fighting stance and replied do you think I will believe your words Juan how wanted to take action immediately what's the point of talking nonsense with them it's not easy to make them disappear I need to fight a bit to warm up before the final boss battle the two demons immediately knelt down and respectfully said we are not lying and have no intention of fighting you we are under the orders of our King to escort The Prince and his companions to the main Palace of the Holy Temple baby Beetle was skeptical saying uncle has always been cunning and full of schemes there's no way I can trust your words Yi Wu turned to ask a vis are these two lying I Vis replied as long as it is a genetically related creature it has a corresponding Spectrum based on the spectrum they emit it can be seen that they are not lying he was still doubtful the sudden Goodwill from the final boss though it is very strange they need to clarify its purpose the only way to find out is to keep moving forward as Anne walked and talked with baby Beal he said anyway the ultimate goal is to reach the main Palace of the Holy Temple having someone to guide us is better right let's go baby Beetle the next step is the final showdown baby Beetle nodded in agreement at that moment Sulu looked towards Yi woo thinking although it wouldn't be difficult to break through the Holy Temple with a single strike to force our way out this person always carries an air of confidence in Victory I'm really curious how he will face the final boss following along to see the excitement would be bad the group entered the grand hall of the Lost Holy Temple main Palace and was greeted by the final boss oswal Fang alar he spoke Heroes of humanity I am oswal Fang alar the ruler of the insect species who has clashed with you before after the recent battle you have the right to enter my main Palace the members of of the mo attack team spoke one after another one person said hemp this is far from what I imagined I thought the final boss would be a large and powerful figure but he looks so weak moreover I don't sense any killing intent from him just a sense of monotony and Decay even though everyone seems to underestimate him because the final boss doesn't match expectations but gwang Chu was very cautious he reminded don't let appearances deceive you be prepared to fight at any moment y wo turned to Baby Beal and said the feeling your uncle brings to others is completely different from what you might imagine and that very long name it looks cool like a royal family should have what about your name it only has two words are you really from the same family baby Beetle replied that is because my master said my name was too long hard to read so he gave me the nickname baby Beal which I have been using ever since he continued with a determined look thank you thank you everyone for coming this far with me next let me bring this few of the Clans to an end right Uncle suddenly standing up he shouted long time no see Dad not only have you managed to live and return but you dare to confront me alone if youve been shown this courage and determination from the start perhaps you could have prevented me from seizing power as Swift as the wind baby Beetle charged forward and said that's why I need to make up for my earlier mistakes as long as I defeat you now everything will not be too late Oswald calmly responded you have indeed grown a lot baby Beetle was surprised when he approached Oswald and felt an invisible shield blocking him he exclaimed this is the same thing Yu use just now Juan how suddenly said the energy Shield is the final boss of the species yet it uses human technology yigu replied our source energy Shield is the magic energy Shield but its energy comes from the heart of the insect species underground does oswal really understand even the principles of engineering this is too surreal oswal casually responded your surprise is merely the result of your arrogance because Scientific Technology does not solely belong to humans with dedicated time for research and accumulation any species can Master this advanced technology our species has a long lifespan making it even more suitable for research and technological accumulation however my brother who is also your father clings to outdated and obsolete ideas he continued by all possible means he suppressed my Progressive ideals severely hindering the development of the insect species therefore I was forced to kill him the baby Beetle Furious charged forward and shouted you're talking nonsense you only covet power and want to dominate the world can't you even reflect on what you've done after seizing the throne stealing energy from the other races using dark energy to create an army Waging War and Slaughter everywhere baby Beetle continued the whole world has been thrown into chaos by you causing suffering to living beings and yet you still dare to claim it's for the future of the insect species Oswell replied with a resounding voice of course he continued my ideology is vastly different from the false peace ideals of your foolish outdated father in the future of the insect species that I Envision there is no place for the weak and useless therefore they all must die I have no interest in seizing the throne taking the throne is merely a means to implement my plan at that moment he had sat down on the high chair and said as for Conquering the World perhaps that's true but what I wish to conquer is not just this narrow piece of the world Yu was taken aback by oswal's words thinking to himself could it be that he like evil has escaped the constraints of dungeon thinking and reached a higher level of Consciousness baby beetle Furious attacked while shouting loudly at this point why do you still have to say deceitful words to trick me I don't want to hear your nonsense come out and we will have a life and death Showdown Oswalt arrogantly responded it seems you truly know nothing no matter we still have plenty of time let me tell you a story a truth that even your father has never shared with you Oswald continued a long long time ago there was a young race although he was a member of a royal family he did not inherit the noble bloodline being much weaker than his strong brother however instead of paying attention to power and fame he preferred to study strange and rare things Oswald went on therefore he often climbed mountains and waited Through Rivers going to places where few had ever set foot to conduct his research and engage in dangerous experiences gradually he realize the narrowness of this world he wondered can't we go any higher the sky seems to be obstructed by an invisible force creating a barrier what is going on oswal continued thus he studied alone for many years but still could not clarify the cause until one day a human swordsman suddenly appeared in this world from that person's words the young race became even more convinced of this speculation the world he was living in was merely a very small space outside of it was a vast world where humans existed he said that world is an immensely vast expanse compared to humans the insect species we belong to far surpass them in many aspects be it in terms of life or strength he continued why should we lock ourselves in this cramped space the young insect species has tried to persuade his brother to awaken the heart of the insect species using that immense source of energy to study how to break through the barrier of space and conquer the vast World outside however he repeatedly refused in an indifferent manner the young insect species angrily question why do you keep stopping me you heard what that human said there is a far bigger World outside our great insect species should not be confined to this small world but he merely replied listen here my foolish younger brother the continuation of life has never required Invasion or expansion War only brings disaster and fear and this will ultimately backfire on our insect species as well Oswald added after many difficulties the Yon insect species could only only researched the historical records of the insect species eventually he discovered a secret successive generations of the royal family of the insect species have been guarding a God's spirit that is closely related to that mysterious barrier of space the baby Beetle spoke up and criticism so you imprisoned Master killed my father and detained my mother just to obtain that God's spirit after saying so much aren't you just trying to find a reason to absolve yourself Oswald responded lightly to escape guilt perhaps perhaps so then he raised his voice the insect species under your father's leadership has lost its fighting spirit and vitality becoming weak and Despicable if this continues the entire insect species will face Extinction for the continuation of the insect species I am willing to Bear any charges hearing such a long story everyone in the royal battle team reacted Lu Fang spoke up hey hey the amount of information in this scenario seems a bit overwhelming is it true that the larger the dungeon the more complex the story background becomes Kakak said he and nil are of the same kind both wanting to resist the constraints of Fate but their methods are too cruel Ruan Tian tan suggested I feel that many things can no longer be explained by the existing setups and the development must be like this yay Yan Fe remarked when you stare into the abyss the abyss is also staring back at you we humans have come and given them an opportunity to Counterattack ye W have self thought infiltration and being infiltrated have a mutual impact instead of saying we are imprisoned it would be better to say we are protected or should say we are protected by that God Spirit our world also has quite a few insect species existing but most are very scattered not forming a quantity in scale like demon beasts ye W continued but if a royal family like Oswald's infiltrates perhaps they will unite the scattered insect species creating a formidable Force baby Beetle thought about this and could no longer endure it he took up his blade rushed forward and angrily said enough do not use this so-called righteousness to confuse others the insect species do not have just one path I will kill you first and then find the most suitable path for myself baby Beetle launched an attack on Oswald but he could not penetrate the armor-like shield around him Oswald remained still indifferently saying you have indeed changed if you were the same as before after knowing the truth you might have stood by my side I initially intended to persuade you and then ask you to convince your mother to surrender the God's spirit but now that is no longer necessary suddenly Oswald's image flickered causing baby Beal to realize that it was merely a 3D projection Oswald continued even if I cannot obtain the God's spirit I can still rely on the technology that your kind has brought to breach the space barrier your teleportation Talisman may be small but once I succeed in researching it I will lead the entire insect species to invade your world haha he said to the group of G Wang Chuan human powerhouses I can see your desire for strength I believe that during the confrontation with the loone you have also experienced a part of it after being Modified by the insect species how powerful he has become do you not desire to possess such supreme power gwang chuan's face darkened as he gritted his teeth teeth and told him continue oswal continued just think about it if you take your already strong abilities and transform them into a new perfect life form then enhance them with technology how powerful would you be you could extend your life from a few decades to hundreds of years wouldn't that tempt you the mo attack team fell silent upon hearing this ye W thought Oswald really knows how to capture people's hearts what he is offering is indeed a deadly Temptation for many I wonder if the mo attack team can remain composed especially G Wang Chun G Wang Chun replied The Proposal is quite interesting so what is the price to pay Oswald answered my requests are not many just help me reach the human world and assist me in battle and I can help you modify your bodies furthermore this time I promise not to control your bodies as I did with the loan Oswalt replied I bet my soul and the future of the insect species Sulu C said maintaining youth for hundreds of years it sounds very tempting but just thinking about transforming into the appearance of the insect species nauseates me I declin this offer unexpectedly ji Wang Chu and Ste forward astonishing Wan how hey what is g planning to do Juan how asked in Surprise are you really considering accepting it Oswell responded oh it seems this person has already made a decision youu observe the situation ation and immediately prepared for battle thinking to himself could it be that my worst fear is about to happen a sword fanatic like G Wang Chuan also wants to become like the lone accepting transformation just to become stronger I must stop him I can't let him walk down an irreversible path like senior and Chang did however G Wang Chuan knocked down all of Oswald's subordinates leaving him astonished gwan chuman scoffed you're just a coward afraid to reveal your true self only boasting with words do you think I would believe you moreover if I can't rely on my own strength to become stronger I have no interest seeing this Yu secretly admired him hemp all right I admit I was thinking too far ahead but what you just said is really cool yiu continued I rely on my own strength to hack surely there's nothing wrong with that right Oswell replied I given you all the best opportunities and if you've chosen to reject them then prepare to die G wine Chuan stepped closer to Oswald and said given the situation do you still have any combat power left to use your subordinates have all been eliminated by us Oswald only laughed loudly haha being underestimated by humans is truly unpleasant but of course I still have power left to use as soon as he finished speaking a member of the insect species clad in armor descended from the sky causing great surprise the the figure that appeared that's mother baby Beetle knelt down and said great I've finally met you mother mother looked at him and smiled oh my dear child I never thought we would reunite like this I am truly happy however her words contradicted her actions she unexpectedly swung a venomous Vine towards her beloved Son causing baby Beal to gasp and exclaim mother what's wrong why are you attacking me allart gasped saying you all step back my body is no longer under my control seeing her mother like this baby Beetle couldn't bear it reaching out and saying mother I will come to save you however ji wangchu and stepped forward cutting the vine that was rushing towards them and said step aside if you cannot bring yourself to act ruthlessly then do not get in the way Yu also stepped up to block staying calm don't act rashly clearly your mother has been controlled by your uncle we should find a way way to break the control first baby Beetle calmed down somewhat but still panicked asked you're right but what should we do right now the main body of Uncle doesn't even know where to hide ywu said the condition of your mother and the sword Saint seems to be different her Consciousness is still clear only her body is being controlled do you know the reason baby Beetle replied it could be because of the remaining Avatar of mother she is not only the queen of the insect species but also the high Priestess of the Holy Temple our insect species each High Priestess holds ancient natural magic so the ability to resist various types of spells and toxins is very high therefore it is possible that uncle has not completely controlled my mother yet ye wo exclaimed it sounds like your mother is very impressive baby Beetle agreed that's right my mother is very powerful in terms of strength she is even stronger than my father if it worked for the uncle's treachery in a direct fight mother would not lose hearing that Yi Wu said from your description isn't jiwan Chun in trouble we can't let him face it alone you must also prepare for the worst upon hearing this baby Beetle fell silent up ahead G wiwan was struggling to cut through the extremely poisonous Vines summoned by allmar but no matter how much he struck he couldn't eliminate them he thought to himself the summoned creatures just keep coming both in quantity and quality this medium girl is truly powerful and seems to hold some Central secret therefore I still can't unleash my full strength to kill her but if this continues wearing me down like this is not a solution what should I do suddenly another allar called out as a warning get out of the way Warrior you can't withstand this magic quickly take my child and run immediately she Unleashed a series of ultraviolet lightning storms causing the ground to shake and shatter towards them G Wang Chun also prepared his stance saying are you looking down on me it seems I have to give it my all However Baby Beetle was a step faster striking a blow through the swirling purple storms saying please stop he leaded his weapon against the ground in a kneely position continuing thank you all for bringing me here next please allow me to walk this final path by myself no matter how terrible the outcome is I am mentally prepared to accept it g wi cheu and saw this and said I hope so because now there is only this final path left are you really mentally prepared baby Beetle replied I am getting ready at this moment alark who had summoned the Stone Giant spoke up in warning why haven't you run away yet my foolish child even if a royal family collapses and the world is destroyed as long as you are alive I would be satisfied please run away However Baby Beetle only responded I promis teacher and ye woo that it was because of my evasion and weakness that led to today's situation therefore I will not run away anymore he charged to confront the Stone Giant shouting even if only one of us survives today I will do my utmost to thwart uncle's plot Oswald stood nearby watching the play exclaiming what a touching reunion on one side is the prince returning from a life and death struggle for revenge on the other side is the queen who lost her lover and is imprisoned and yet mother and son meet only to slaughter each other truly fascinating haha continue continue luang was extremely enraged drawing his axe and shouting Dan it I really want to chop it into pieces just that I lack the capability to do so ye W thought I should suggest that baby Beetle seriously fight with its mother to attract the boss's attention at that moment I will use the eye of positioning to find its true form however the eye of positioning only probe humans it is unclear whether it can differentiate this humanoid biological creature no matter I use it first and figure things out later yiu activated the eye of positioning while baby Beetle tried to buy time wishing inwardly V woo quickly find out the true form of Uncle with the essence of the insect teacher I feel stronger than before even the magic of mother can't resist me if I take it a bit more seriously mother will really be defeated at that moment allmark spoke to his son my son in your attacks I sense no ambiguity at all you have truly grown up if your father could see you he would be very pleased baby Beetle replied to his mother this is the final inheritance that teacher the lone used his life to exchange for I cannot disappoint teacher and I will not let people in Father down allmark felt relieved and smiled if that's the case then I can be at ease she transmitted a pinkish purple sound wave toward toward baby Beetle taking him into another space when he opened his eyes baby Beetle was astonished and exclaimed isn't this the secret realm of bloodline of mother allmark spoke that's right this is a secret realm that only a royal family with a bloodline connected to me can enter do you remember this place baby Beetle responded of course I remember when I was little I often followed mother to play hide and seek here but as I grew up I no longer liked coming here but then he suddenly recognized a familiar face why woo why are you here too yiu was also puzzled you're asking me who should I ask I was using a skill to trace the location of your uncle and suddenly my Consciousness got pulled into here alark said it seems that baby Beetle has signed a bloodline contract with you which is why you were pulled in here Yi Wu contemplated for a moment then said so VX it bloodline then the connection between me and baby beetle is a bit complicated now so how should we handle this who summoned whom baby Beetle said this is not important mother because yiu is a trustworthy person it is thanks to his help that I escaped death and was able to meet you again all Mark hearing this expressed his gratitude it is clear that you have done a lot for my child on behalf of the entire Clan I would like to extend my sincere thanks to you yiu humbly replied no no I just helped out casually there is no need to be too formal he then asked so what is the issue here the queen what do you intend to do by pulling us into the secret realm of bloodline seus gently reached out to touch her son's face Whispering baby Beetle since you were little you have always been a child with a kind heart your father and I did not want to place too many burdens on you we just wanted you to live life in your own way but unexpectedly disaster struck suddenly and that has made you grow up because resilient and more reliable baby Beetle was moved and called mother seus handed him a god Spirit of emerald green and instructed this is the god spirit that our royal family has protected for Generations I have always kept it hidden in my Consciousness to prevent oswal from finding it now I can finally rest assured to give it to you baby Beetle reached out to receive the God's spirit from his mother he obediently replied yes mother I will definitely not spare my life to protect this God spirit but what is its actual purpose Uncle once said it could be used to break the chaples of the world is that true his mother shook her head and explained that is just one man's speculation the inheritance of this God's spirit is too ancient and the way to use it has long been lost but there is one ancestral instruction passed down from generation to generation in our insect species that we must protect it at all costs otherwise the consequences will be more terrifying than the destruction of the world after that she turned to prepare to leave and instructed my child forgive me for only being able to accompany you this far I can no longer suppress the toxins in my body when we break the secret space there will be a moment of vulnerability you must seize that opportunity to kill me hearing his mother's words he exclaimed in panic mother I blame myself for being useless it's all my fault if I could be stronger everything could have been avoided damn it he pounded his fist on the ground in Anger his mother feeling pain for her child turned back to embrace the baby bee and said her farewell you silly child seeing you grow up I have no regrets in dying in the Embrace of his mother baby Beetle choked back his emotions unable to articulate mother mother the atmosphere between the two was filled with emotion but suddenly yiu spoke up breaking the moment sorry to interrupt a bit yiu said but I have a plan that can avoid this life and death separation baby Beetle was still doubtful but deep down he was eager to hear the solution what is it but the Oswaldo toxin in my body cannot be completely eliminated is there really a way to avoid this ending the mother asked anxiously baby Beetle quickly reassured his mother mother if Yu says there's a way then there must be a way he believed in y woo and was ready to try any method to save his mother R woo hurry and tell me what are you you intend to do Yi Wu smiled let my assistant explain to everyone then a surprising figure appeared and spoke up hello two of you I am a vis the loyal assistant of the master both baby Beetle and his mother were taken AB baby Beetle's mother questioned another person why does another Outsider appear in this secret realm baby beetle is just like your mother this has always been a private space just me and my mother I didn't expect today there would be another person I Vis did not pay attention to the reactions of the two mothers and children continuing to explain please don't mind these Minor Details speaking of the main issue we do not need to forcibly eliminate the toxin instead let the toxin naturally dissipate and then just show allar The Forbidden Fruit of the princess this is a crafted version of the princess's forbidden fruit classified as Grandmaster level potion its effect is that when consumed the user will immediately fall into a state of suspended animation for 24 hours after this period they will revive with only one HP Health ye wo added more information about the forbidden fruit I currently have the materials needed for the crafting we can take advantage of this suspended animation effect to deceive alar as long as we kill him within 24 hours the toxin in your mother's body will naturally disappear this method gives us more time than my previous assumption Semus hesitated turning to ask but allar is also very skilled in potion making can we really deceive him yiu reassured don't worry as long as his knowledge of pharmaceutics has not reached Grandmaster level he won't Discover it however this plan also has a disadvantage that I need to clarify with you a vis continued to analyze previously I analyzed the conflict of the aarant essence with the medicine I discovered that its existence would reduce the effectiveness of the medicine if we want to completely outsmart Oswald we must eliminate it baby Beetle hesitated to speak up but once the ab barent Essence is lost mother will not only lose a significant portion of her power but her lifespan will also decrease considerably even so this result is still better than your initial intention mother femine comforted it's okay I'd already made up my mind to die now that there is a chance to live as long as I can see you rebuild the glory of the insect species losing the ab barent Essence is not a problem knowing that baby Beal still couldn't bear it mother if you have decided that then we only have to try he turned to bow to ywo and said then I will trouble you y wo y wo assured don't worry follow each step of my plan I will definitely bring a perfect outcome for both of you suddenly baby Beetle was attacked without having time to evade he stumbled back and bumped into yiu yiu caught him and asked baby Beetle are you okay baby beetle was not worried about himself but hurriedly said I'm fine but mother baby beetles saw mother completely enveloped in a stream of magical energy and she seriously warned baby Beetle you must run fast if you continue like this you will die baby Beetle firmly replied no I won't agree mother mother began to gather magical power all over her body preparing for a self-destructing attack seeing this baby Beetle clenched The Sword and said if there truly is no way to save you then at least let me send you off myself mother in pain and tears responded if you are so determined then I have no regrets now brace yourself for my final blow indeed the two were playing their roles too deeply from a distance oswal laughed hardly full of Pride how interesting the climax of this motherson tragedy has finally arrived haha Juan how watched the scene genuinely worried and asked his captain hey G aren't you really going to step in and stop this this motherson tragedy is too cruel no matter what baby be once saved Our Lives GW cheu and stood still only reminding be quiet and observe everything is not as simple as it seems I don't believe this situation is real I don't believe Yu would let baby Beetle truly face life and death with her mother he must be calculating something heulu rubbed his chin and analyzed this little rascal when he took the worm must have been secretly doing something with it though his movements were very subtle he couldn't hide it from me what is his true purpose at this moment baby Beetle continued to draw his sword preparing for the finishing blow he aimed the sword at his mother with a strong determination he knew that this strike meant life or death he shouted ah a ah a painful scream rang out from his mother as he launched the next attack he displayed obvious anxiety he silently apologized in his heart mom for uncle's sake I must use all my strength to extract the essence of the strange insect from you I know this will hurt a lot please bear with it after a series of attacks a blinding light emanated from his mother's chest in his hands was the god spirit that she had concealed in her Consciousness earlier oswal was astonished seemingly unable to believe his eyes this situation was completely Beyond his expectations you you actually dare to do this even your own mother Yi Wu observed the unfolding situation quietly assessing the next move he thought very good it seems he hasn't detected the effect of the drug next let me handle this when the vehicle tipped over baby Beetle hurried over to support his mother mother I'm really sorry despite being injured she still tried to caress her son's face comforting him son you you done well hold your head high do not regret Yu's teammates also joined in on the performance this is truly heartbreaking she said baby Beetle if you want to cry come and cry in your sister's arms Yu didn't know what to say the acting skills are truly convincing everyone has been deceived the bald man clasped his hands in front of his chest to console keep your grief at Bay although you and I are different beings I can perform a ceremony to guide Spirits for you baby Beetle replied coldly thank you for your kindness but there is still an important matter that needs to be completed after saying this he left his mother behind turned around his eyes unstable with emotion and shouted are you satisfied now then hurry and get out here for me Oswald and Oswald also sighed at baby beetles Act of sacrificing his mother he spoke up I didn't expect you to be so ruthless to even turn against your own mother it seems she is dead and your plan to obtain the god Spirit has naturally failed it seems I have underestimated you now if we want to break through the spatial boundary we can only Force our way through the teleportation talismans are still not stable enough but as long as one is willing to pay the price of loss success to certain however one's plans cannot compare to the Heaven's calculations G Wang Chuan confidently spoke resolving each of the situations your subordinates have been killed off by us nearly to the last and the incubation chamber Amber has also been destroyed even if you break through the spatial boundary what you have left to invade the human world despite this he remained untroubled and responded you don't need to worry about that because I am a swarm after saying this he gradually disappeared the baby beetles shouted to stop him don't run Oswald once Oswald's figure vanished the Holy Temple shook violently and everyone was in a state of panic what's happening the Holy Temple is about to collapse stop being foolish this Holy Temple was originally inside the belly of the ancient Zerg it seems they intend to surround us and digest us all what is this what should we do to escape from here at this moment Sulu began to take action she calmly and collectively activated her combat power she declared the show is over I am going to reclaim this place now and head outside then she thrust a Vortex of divine power straight upwards one how admired wow this Escape method is so simple and crude G wi Chuan next to called out danlou Lulu didn't need her team Captain's command she understood the intention and replied understood she opened the book and recited the incantation in the name of the Gentle Wind soaring that was the wind and rain incantation that allowed their team to fly along the path of Sulu everyone was in awe of this experience we are flying no doubt about it this is my little sister Dan L's wind magic this feeling of soaring is so refreshing asn't it after boasting Juan how turned to ask for the captain's opinion Brother G are we really leaving like this so what about the last bundle g w chuan's expression remained unchanged as he replied let's temporarily leave this place first and then decide that guy is Crafty and it's not easy to find his true body right now you also sense that the situation was taking a turn for the worse he thought my positioning eye was previously severed by the secret realm of bloodline of the mother baby Beal so how can I find Oswald's True Body now the current situation makes me uneasy outside the Holy Temple both sides were tense and confronted liai clasped his hands behind his back and asked sha Ling you all can't hold back anymore do you want to make a move here Ling you on reassured live just says irritation don't worry grandm Li ji none of us wants to escalate the situation furthermore it's not up to us to determine the winner but rather the group inside we just need to wait for the results liai pondered and asked still unable to contact Mo attack team and Y woo L chain Fang replied no since your last contact with them we haven't been able to reach them they must have entered an area with complete Sigma loss the team on the other side was not doing any better Ling Yuan anxiously asked why hasn't suu come out yet she said she wanted to go in to take down that kid and confront the final boss I only agreed to let her act alone he spoke up to reassure perhaps she encountered some unexpected situation after all the enemy is numerous despite outwardly showing concern for Kulu in his heart Lang Yuan felt SMUD it would be best if she dies in there one thing that annoys me the most about her is her disdain for others yet she won't even die properly suddenly sharp claws shot up from beneath the ground causing the Earth to crack open those on the surface couldn't react in time and fell in screaming watch out for the ground he reacted quickly wrapping his arms around Ling Yuan and jumping up while saying Hold On Tight To Me Li Jessi used his equipped tool to fly up avoiding the ground unable to help but worry the Holy Temple is shaking collapsing what on Earth happened inside ye woo the others surely wouldn't just as that thought crossed his mind a bright blue Whirlwind carrying the group below the Holy Temple shot straight up everyone cheered look quickly the Holy Temple has been destroyed Zulu sister is out it's the mo attack team along with ye woo with the others suu landed safely in a super cool pose but someone filled with jealousy questioned her what are you doing Sulu why is that Yu still alive didn't you say you wanted to kill him Sulu ignored it casually reply while walking what are you saying the noise is too loud I can't hear you Ling you on Furious clenched his fists and shouted don't play dumb with me he looked in sulu's Direction and said don't be angry lay you on now is not the time to pursue this matter we need to leave the center of this town quickly they quickly soared up trying to find a way to escape this place but no matter which direction they turned a claw would rise up from the ground to block their path it's no good the way back is blocked one person in the group shouted jiwang Chun and Y Wu shouted in unison get out of the way leave it to us this was the first time they collaborated so harmoniously each person focused on fighting causing everyone around to admire their cohesive combination and full of valiant demeanor team leader GW Chu shouted loudly vwoo wait a minute what about that little blue insect species what's going on at G Wang cheu and fought he guided clear a path for the whole team to exit the danger zone finally when they were safe liai sees the opportunity to ask how is the battle going have you eliminated the final boss yet gwang chuan's answer disappointed him he frowned and replied unfortunately not it could be said that the next part is the the main act feeling that something was off he was astonished what is the final boss so strong that it can't be defeated y Wu spoke up from below the specifics are still unclear we haven't even fought it directly but it's cunning and treachery have made us extremely worry Yu continued right now what worries me the most is based on his previous habits what this boss likes to do the most is to borrow strength from others now that we are disrupting his original plan he might become desperate and do something Reckless with no way out suddenly the system sounded an alert warning warning warning underground 500 M away there is a high energy response rapidly approaching countdown time 3 2 yiu suddenly remembered this is the underground probe from before damn it this flag is definitely a nogo boom a large object unexpectedly shot up from the ground walking their path what is that it just burst out of the ground y Wu exclaimed moreover this is way too big this time it was a hidden boss an ancient insect God level creature of unknown identity Juan Hal how looked at the demon beast and exclaimed hey everyone look at its face why does it look like Oswald the man with purple hair was also panicked that's right what is going on Yu stood aside staring at the demon Beast then said my bad premonition has indeed come true this oswal has fused himself with the ancient insect God L Fang was astonished upon hearing this what you looked over and said Liah s Grandmaster how's the progress on the teleportation Talisman he frowned and replied right now we have only completed 60% the kid Nana in your squad is responsible for the ore extraction area but there is only the digging machine remaining so progress is still not improving youu looked worriedly at the system and thought this is trouble although the state of weakness has disappeared the countdown to the death time of the deut toxin is still ongoing on the system screen it displayed Leu level 13 lethal toxin countdown to death time remaining 3 minutes seeing this information he continued to ponder moreover this boss is clearly not one that can be taken down quickly is there really no choice but to give up unexpectedly Yi Wu was startled by a loud shout from behind you guys go ahead baby Beal holding a sword quickly charged forward yiwu shouted baby beet what are you trying to do without looking back baby Beetle only replied I will hold him off so you can buy some time you have helped me too much already facing the enemy who killed my father and my master I cannot run away anymore baby Beetle continued God spirit I entrust this to to you if I die please take my place as the king of this world if this world still exists yeu saw a symbol resembling that of a baby Beal appear on his chest he looked up at the sky which had turned purple this is the blood's secret realm yiu was angry punched the baby Beetle on the head and scolded do you still want to show off as a heroic Commander here if you are a hero then take responsibility properly don't easily seek death don't forget your mother is still waiting for you if you die it's a life for two lives the baby Beetle was punched to the point where its head swelled up crying out he yiu turned away gently rotating his wrist because the punch was somewhat strong he didn't bother looking at the baby beel and continued speaking of which it's rare to encounter a five-star compatible dungeon so how can I allow it to be taken away from me don't anyone expect to take a readymade piece of meat from my mouth don't even think about it the baby Beetle seeing that Yu was still angry worriedly thought to himself even though I don't know what he's talking about why do I feel his fighting spirit is even higher than mine ji Wang chuun was cutting through demon beasts while commanding Wan how you take the others back to the rear stop at the teleportation Talisman construction Point keep away from the boss's attack range and be on guard against the insect species damaging the teleportation talsman Juan how heard this and surprised asked ha why is it me I also want to stay and fight just call those bald heads out GW Chu steep forward seriously saying no the final boss with the three question mark has surpassed our capabilities the Swarm tactics won't work against it you must Retreat to hold the teleportation Talisman we will do our best to delay its steps buying time to build the teleportation Talisman once the teleportation Talisman is complete you must go directly in without waiting for us Juan how wanted to speak up but before he could finish his sentence y Wu interrupted the members of my team have already worked with you onean with you there I'll feel more secure Wan how looked at y wo perplexed vwoo why you too all right then R says the Vice Captain has to take care of this senior he quickly walked away not forgetting to encourage Yu's group before leaving leave the others and the teleportation Talisman to me you all must give that cunning boss a good beating on my behalf yigu smiled no problem looking at the large demon Beast before them yeu grinned so who strikes first or do we all go together I hope this ghost isn't too easy for us to crush to the point of crying baby Beetle ji Wang Chuan and Y Wu steep forward baby Beetle swung the sword determined this first strike must be mine if we can't kill the uncle our insect Clan will never have peace he used the skill the annihilation of all eras causing the ancient insect God's Health to drop to 90% seeing this baby Beetle was horrified the profound meaning could only harm it by 10% of its Health how frustrating I'm still too weak Yu stepped up patting him on the shoulder to reassure him this isn't your fault perhaps because you use the profound meaning consecutively in a short time the damage was reduced the main issue is still its massive Health gwi chew and frowned now we must adjust our tactics normal harassment attacks cannot pull its hate value we must deal a powerful blow saying this he raised his sword and stabbed it straight into his chest ye Wu gasped and shouted are you crazy don't do something foolish GNE cheu and calmly replied this is my strongest move I must sacrifice health and blood to activate it with this move I will surely lock in the boss's ha the sword pierced through G Wang chuan's body slowly drawing out blood that stained the blade and along with the sword he began to fade away he quickly deployed the blood storm technique H uh the blood Vortex he controlled shifted Direction toward the ancient insect God the system reported the health of the ancient insect God has decreased to 70% GW cheu and sat down heavily coughing cough cough cough in the end the Gap is still too large the system announced blood backlash all attributes reduced to below 90% cannot be restored lasts for 2 hours at this moment a beam of light pierced through GW chuan's blood Vortex cutting through three layers of ice shining directly at them Yu used his sword to block that powerful beam of light momentarily thinking ha the hatred value is still insufficient but this attack power it is too ordinary he looked at his health points and realized he was only at 40% Health while his life points were at 55% yiu looked up in Surprise suu didn't you withdraw with bang Jen group Sulu stood watching them smirking have you forgotten what I said I've always been most interested in hunting powerful bosses and right before me is a magnificent prey I'm so excited I can't contain myself how could I possibly let it go g Wang Chu was being supported on Yu's shoulder looking at her and saying don't underestimate the enemy it's not something you can handle alone cough cough cough Yu took out the vial of medicine and said don't talk anymore it's a good thing that susulu is stepping in to help us all just drink this recovery potion first Sulu closed her eyes her face full of confidence and said I'm not so arrogant to think I can kill it alone this is an extremely rare opportunity for me to try out my strongest move howling Arctic wind just how powerful can it be the green sword shot out surrounding the ancient Zerg in an instant the demon Beast was encased in thick ice also bound with chains and sword seals the system announced Zulu has only 1% of her life left she stood casually looking at the large block of ice in front of her magic freeze preventing her from using any techniques for the next 30 minutes y woo and the others gaped at the scene before them the baby beetles stared blankly Whispering strong too strong y wo exclaimed in shock if this move had been used on me before I definitely would have lost my life jiwang Chun looked at her and thought to himself this woman indeed has the right to be proud suddenly the thick ice appeared with a hole the layers of ice slowly cracked and broke apart a the ancient Zerg had successfully broken the ice its Health points were only left at 40% fu looked at it frowning and thinking to herself so this was all the seal could do she stared intently at the ancient Zerg and said this boss looks to be at least level 220 or higher ji Wang cheu and quickly spoke up make your move y woo use your strongest power don't hold back if you have any methods use them quickly yiu replied all right got it but before that he looked at them scratched his head awkwardly and asked do you to happen to have any money on you could you lend me a bit Sulu and G wangchu and exclaimed in unison ha bo broke into a sweat upon hearing that question astonished and saying borrow money from us are we hearing things wrong at this critical moment y Wu extended his hand looked at them seriously and said you're not hearing things wrong I really need to borrow some money baby Beetle immediately replied y woo do you need a lot of money unfortunately I don't have any human currency otherwise I would definitely give it all to you yiu gave him a thumbs up saying thank you for your support I accept your kind intentions ji Wang Chun looked at Yu frowning as he asked if you are greedy for money you should at least differentiate between situations right besides what's the point of taking money at this moment in contrast to G wine chuan's Grim expression Sulu cheerfully asked him surely you are not not planning to borrow money and then run away or just decide to die and not pay it back are you Yu glanced at them calmly responding don't worry although I love money I absolutely will not default on my debts if you want to see my true strength then don't Dole quickly lend me the money the more I borrow the stronger I will become pausing for a moment he smiled proudly and said moreover the ultimate move that I have kept hidden I don't usually use it lightly today you can consider yourselves fortunate to witness it Sulu leisurely opened the system transferring the money to Yi wo while saying although I don't know how money relates to strength you have pequ my interest I actually want to see what you call the ultimate move and how strong it can really be Yu looked at the system notification Sulu has transferred 200 million to you he happily replied 200 million the goddess is truly generous yiu was excited to see the syst notification G Wang Chuan has transferred 300 million to you he exclaimed joyfully as expected of Captain G even more generous G Wang Chu and stared at y Wu and said seriously personally I don't have that much money this is the team's activity fund and you have to remember to pay it back Yi Wu upon hearing this began to sweat more and quickly smiled haha of course should I write you an IOU gwang Chu replied no need for that just stay alive that's all the most important thing is that ultimate move of yours don't let me down yiu felt excited lightly stretching his joints and responded rest assured I will definitely not disappoint everyone in his heart Yu had already made calculations although he had saved quite a bit of money before to ensure safety taking a little more wouldn't hurt with this large sum if the Shadow King couldn't crush the boss it could still give him some some trouble the ancient Zerg after successfully breaking the ice quickly approached y Wu with a cheerful laugh haha it took so much time to fully integrate now I can finally control this body freely Yu stood in front of it and asked fully integrated does that mean you were still in a state of vague Consciousness before the ancient Zerg happily replied that's right wanting to merge with the ancient Holy Temple and moreover to retain Consciousness is extremely difficult before that if you cannot kill me you will have already lost your only chance compared to before I will be even stronger now haha system notification the ancient zergs health is 70% life index is 30% Gan chuin group exclaimed in shock what we barely managed to reduce its health and it's already recovering yiu raised his hand High beginning to shift into a new form he calmly said no need to panic whether it's Health recovers or not it makes no difference in front of me he quickly commanded system activate Shadow King's special State cash burn status system notification activating Shadow King special form please wait a moment reminder the special form will consume double the currency please pay attention to the remaining amount at this moment the ancient zerb began to attack saying hundreds of thousands of Lial poisonous Rays you three are all useless now relying on just one person you cannot possibly defeat me no matter what you plan to do just riding me off will be the end the ancient Zerg continuously shot toxic beams at ywo but the more it shot the more amazed it became to think it could absorb my radiation how is that possible a pure white body was growing together a large amount of blood gradually gathered in the air forming a giant the Shadow King gigantic Crimson Divine sword had appeared baby Beetle looked at Yu's new form with admiration saying no wonder it's ye woo this form is not inferior to the ancient pure blood race at all and even shines more powerfully Su question is this the strongest technique that yiu mentioned jiwan Chu and silently frowned in thought although Dian Juan's report mentioned that Yi Wu transformed into a blood colored giant dragon while fighting dominant exotic chain I didn't believe it before now witnessing it with my own eyes this has exceeded my understanding of strength y woo are you really human the image of the ancient Zerg and the Shadow King facing each other was Majestic and Powerful causing everyone around to be astonished and disgust the man with purple hair pointed at the shadow cane asking everyone what is that have we accidentally walked into a film set Juan Hal also replied Ambiguously that person cannot be the old man nor can it beai could it be y woo Gan F Stood Beside them exclaiming in astonishment that is brother the ancient Zerg disdainfully said hemp isn't flaunting just about becoming a little bigger that's fine the bigger the target the more I can unleash my Firepower saying that it quickly Unleashed a move with billions of beams of death light a surge of power emanated from it all directed toward the shadow K he exclaimed in shock how is this possible my attack was completely absorbed the Shadow King smiled seeing that the flow of energy was completely absorbed into his body then he quickly transformed with four large swords appearing in his hands along with four wings on his back everyone gasped Whispering zi wo after absorbing the boss's energy beams had transformed into two long Spears is he preparing to Counterattack seeing the Shadow King rushing towards him the ancient Zerg said if the energy beams are ineffective then try the final toxin that I have created as the shadow came got closer the ancient Zerg immediately revealed its belly shooting thousands of toxins at him seeing the toxins stick to his arms and legs and all over his body the ancient Zerg joyfully said haha how does that taste the ancient Zerg continued My ultimate toxin can defy any defense corroding the host that comes into contact with it no matter how strong you are you cannot resist the tearing toxins that were eating away inside were now gone the Shadow King quickly recovered the ancient Zerg Furious raised its claws and shouted damn it do you really have no weaknesses at all no in my world I cannot allow anyone to exist stronger than me the Shadow King swiftly dodged the ancient zergs claws using his sword to pierce through the ancient zergs body a the ancient Zerg with its overwhelming power forced the Shadow King to retreat at this moment it used its sharp claws to strike at him frantically saying if that's the case then we shall die together let's see who dies first haha at this moment the blood of the ancient zerd was being absorbed by the shadow kingk blades causing the ancient zerd to scream in agony it hurts so much what you want to do my life is being absorbed by you damn it let me go the ancient Zer thrashed violently it wanted to quickly separate itself from the Shadow King but it couldn't its entire body was currently being absorbed into to him the system reported the ancient zergs health is at 10% Life Force at 30% baby Beetle exclaimed in amazement we won yiu defeated the ancient insect god without giving him a chance to fight back he's really so powerful everyone was shielding themselves from the sprays of blood from the ancient insect God while focusing intently on the scene G Wang chew and suddenly spoke up no yiwu's momentum has suddenly stagnated Twi low anxiously said that's right what's wrong with him the system continuously announced warning warning to ensure the safety of the owner's Consciousness it cannot maintain the special Shadow King form anymore if forced to maintain it the owner will fall into a state of excessive fusion and Consciousness will be seized warning the fusion degree between the owner and Shadow King has reached its limit if Fusion continues irreparable consequences will occur please make a careful judgment chaotic mental value currently at 10% a member of the mat Kong team worriedly asked what's going on why did Yu stop what happened the ancient insect God arrogantly spoke at such a crucial moment you choose to stand still it laughed loudly haha indeed Heaven does not wish to destroy me it's time to use my ultimate move Yu stood facing the enemy his gaze is icy as Frost the heart of the inct emitted a dim glow its Rhythm seemed to merge with the surrounding space the baby Beetle sighed and said ye Wu is moving it seems he can hear the heart of the insect and is reacting the enemy laughed loudly haa do you think that relying on yourself alone can change anything my ancient insect God has absorbed 10% of the blood and 30% of the learning you have no chance at all yigu did not respond only silently charged forward a fierce battle erupted Ed the initial level of chaos was only 20% but quickly escalated to 30 40 and finally reached 90% in that moment yiu suddenly stopped the enemy was momentarily surprised and then burst into laughter haha you have stopped you are nothing but a bragger at the end of your rope in the end the Victor will still be me go die as long as you die no one will be able to stop me anymore he swung his sword down but at that moment something strange occurred all the tentacles surrounding him suddenly betrayed cutting their connection to him to drain energy from the heart of the insect he panicked and shouted huh why did my tentacles betray me they want to monopolize the energy impossible I must kill all of you the battle grew even more chaotic yiu seized the opportunity and Unleashed a decisive blow it turned out that the level 120 Sandstorm Incubus had betrayed the insect however he was not a match for the insect and was quickly defeated by his abilities after eliminating the obstacle he laughed uproariously I will spare your life for now when I invade the human world I will still need you this time no one will be able to stop me anymore saying that he gathered all his strength and cried out preparing to welcome the tune I can feel the Abundant energy rushing towards me ah this taste is so delicious with this energy I will break through this damn space barrier in one breath last apart time and space the M Kong combat team began to worry baby Beetle spoke up oh no it's about to break space powerfully GW Chu responded damn it my body can't move at all Sulu anxiously sought a solution my magic value can't recover can I only watch helplessly the captain frowned secretly thinking if this boss really manages to reach the human world it will definitely cause a bloody storm although I don't want to admit defeat in the end and we have lost to Yu suddenly baby Beetle exclaimed wait a minute what do you see over there from the sky a large red sphere appeared baby Beetle immediately recognized it and shouted isn't that the red sphere on the chest of the giant before why is it appearing here the sphere unexpectedly emitted red lightning bolts causing the enemy a scream he how is this possible didn't I kill you no why can't I move he struggled screaming in pain no I clearly won no we don't have to turn back anymore a the god of insects cannot fail I cannot fail the plan I have worked on for so many years cannot be destroyed in an instant I cannot accept it I cannot accept it the insect was crushed by the power of the sphere being directly submerged in pain the Special Forces team rejoiced in praise you did so great y woo but it seemed that y wo had lost consciousness everyone anxiously called his name are you okay y woo y woo the system suddenly announced warning chaotic blood devour is on the verge of death the Master's spirit is in serious disorder unable to awaken by any magic evil or props warning the chaotic Spirit index has reached 100% reconstructing the consciousness of the master the consciousness of the master is being forcefully transmitted ywo suddenly woke up in shock he asked where is this place the system replied this is a result of the master merging excessively with the account currently you have been forcibly pulled into the mental world of the Shadow King only by completing missions in this world could you leave Yi Wu was taken a back and asked again forcibly pulled in I had planned to go through the dungeon insect first before taking on the Shadow King Mission but now it seems the Quest level in this world isn't too high it should only be around level 20 perhaps it will be easy to surpass he looked around and saw that the scenery here was a village engulfed in a plague level 20 civilians lay sprawl on the road the system announced I regret to inform you that due to being forcibly pulled into the Shadow King Dimension your original accounts capabilities cannot be inherited entirely you can only randomly receive abilities from one account currently the account you have is most SI Master Alchemist y w panicked does that mean I'm only level 13 now moreover the master Alchemist title of MOSI isn't meant for combat so what am I supposed to fight with suddenly a wolf-like monster appeared from above the system calmly reassured please concentrate and pay attention to the task at hand Laguna shrubbed his shoulders looked at Yu happily and said what's wrong Yu is there something wrong why are you just standing there in a days Yu looked at him feeling hard to express then smiled and replied uh it's nothing just lead the way let's set off Laguna quickly responded and took the lead Yu walked behind him asking as they went what was the mission system just now do we have to help him completely become the shadow cane in order to leave this world the system replied that's not the case the mission process is a long chain classified as an epic level Mission it cannot be fully completed in a short time this time just completing a certain part of the content is enough to return to the real world yeu wondered then what will happen to the real world while I'm here I remember I defeated the final boss the system quickly explained the flow of time in the Two Worlds is independent of each other when you return time will be almost at a standstill at the point you left so there's no need to worry Yu nodded letting out a sigh of relief Yu stared ahead intently and thought it seems to resemble the treasure stealing demon lair so I'm still luckier than I expected he stepped up beside Laguna and asked earlier you mentioned that you are an apprentice Hunter so what exactly do Hunters do how is the salary the income of this profession I'm very curious to know Laguna turned his head to look at y wo frowning as he said have you never heard of hunters is it possible that you have no such profession where you're from then he seriously explained his ideals the hunter Guild is a very ancient organization with a history of over a hundred years back then this world was invaded by terrifying demons and even the king's Army was powerless suddenly an armed group consisting of hunters and Priests appeared they used weapons and holy magic to fiercely repel the demons and ultimately saved this world after the demons were defeated they refused all rewards and titles from mcain instead they transformed into a congregation dedicated to protecting towns and Villages officially Nam naming themselves the hunter guild at this point Laguna's entire face lit up he appeared incredibly determined and excited continuing Hunters do not have a fixed salary our income depends on the number and difficulty of each Mission he said since I was a child I have always yearned to pursue this profession and now there is only one step left for me to fulfill my dream as long as I complete this task I will become an official Hunter and be able to earn 40 gold coins of course I will share half of it with you youu looked at the person unsure of how to respond and could only politely decline money is not important to me I simply admire your dream which is why I agreed to help in his heart Yu thought to himself two gold coins to someone who is in debt for 5 million like me is just a drop in the bucket helping him is better however during the previous battle I don't know how much I spent the system also didn't send any accounting information so I hurriedly opened the system screen to check yiwu's eyes widened as he looked at the balance on the system screen 86 m581 635 he gasped astonished and asked how is there still 800 million could it be that I was forced into the mission account Dimension without spending anything the system immediately dismissed his unrealistic thought please Master abandoned that unrealistic idea after returning to the real world the consumption cost from the previous battle will be settled immediately however before returning the master can still spend in this world yiwu was caught off guard by this Dan system silently lamenting with deaths piling up like this how am I supposed to survive I knew it right away there's no way anything good would happen looking towards the ominous forest in front of him ywu stood between two diverging paths deep and thought at that moment lagona spoke up Dr Victor is missing deep within the forest ahead if we're ready we should go in and search but it's certainly filled with dangers inside Yu listened feeling a bit at a loss for words he thought to himself this doctor really is brave daring to venture alone into such a perilous place just then a loud call came from behind the two were startled and turned to see a group of hunters from The Guild approaching leading them was Li rang level 38 accompanying him were two others Maxim and Alonso both both level 35 ly rang looked at Yi Wu and Laguna smirking mockingly oh isn't that Laguna chicken out in the middle of the night going for a stroll huh be careful you don't get eaten by a werewolf Laguna frowned and replied seriously so it's you guys I received a mission to rescue Dr Victor he's gone missing in the forest lyang scoffed glancing towards the Deep Woods a rescue mission huh how tedious but also interesting it seems we have a chance to cooperate again lyang expressed his disdain and said is it that drunken idiot Victor again time again playing The Vanishing act it's really a hassle by the way a chicken like you going deep into the forest is like asking for death Laguna felt a bit embarrassed hearing him say that he reached out towards Yu and said senior I'm not going alone y wo will help me Yu looked at the scene and couldn't help but laugh it seemed that being bullied at at work was the same no matter the time or place ly rang looked at y woo his expression excited and said kid you're really strange what are you talking about what do you mean by workplace bullying I don't understand anything are you from somewhere else but to think a little kid at level 13 like you would dare follow this chicken to go looking for death suddenly L rang burst out laughing haha I see your intention Laguna you're not planning to find someone as a cushion are you when danger arises you'll just push him aside to be a bullet sponge right Laguna shouted angrily I'm not I don't have you guys shouldn't insult yo I respect you as my seniors and normally I can endure whatever teasing you put me through but ywo is my friend and furthermore he's very capable you shouldn't casually insult him like that seeing Luna angry light rang glare at him who do you think you talking to the obedient chicken who usually listens has has the audacity to raise his voice at us just because of someone from elsewhere are you tired of living Laguna trembled as he looked at Yu I I he didn't know how to defend Yu properly seeing that Luna had reverted to his old self L rang continued but who told you to be the youngest in our hunter Guild for your safety and your friends dangerous missions like this should still be handled by the seniors the two people standing next to lyang shuffled happily Alfonso ch in hey no need to thank us Laguna enr protested what are you guys talking about this isn't following the rules clearly I however L rang and the others didn't bother to listen any further and quickly galloped into the deep forest Laguna hurriedly chased after them wait you guys watching them disappear he punched the ground in frustration so infuriating they know this is the final test for me to become an official Hunter yet they intentionally snatched my mission away this is it he suddenly remembered that Yu was still here forced a smile and said I'm sorry for making you come all this way for nothing and to suffer this indignity but don't worry the two gold coins I promised you I will definitely find a way to gather enough you looked at him and calmly said what nonsense are you talking about are you the type of person who easily gives up when facing difficulties Laguna lowered his head and helplessly replied actually I am not a weak person even if I encounter a stronger monster I would dare to charge in and fight without hesitation but the relationships among the hunter Guild are quite complicated even if I am bullied I don't want to ruin this relationship and end up being isolated by everyone YW bent down extended his hand to him and said cheerfully in short everything must be resolved by strength listen to me it's better to cry in a BMW than to smile on a bicycle as long as you are stronger than everyone El else you will become the center of the universe I believe your dreams definitely don't just stop at your current level hearing these words Luna regained his confidence he reached out and took Yu's hand smiled and said you're right now is not the time to be downcast let's hurry and catch up Yu nodded and replied that's the spirit the main quest progress notification system the path of the Shadow King has undergone a change the current progress is only 1% Yu was surprised thinking to himself oh it finally changed could it be that what I just said has had some impact on him they continued to delve deeper into the forest when they saw a grave Before Their Eyes Yu asked is this a cemetery Laguna following behind quickly replied Dr Victor seems to gather herbs nearby you was astonished and said Gathering herbs in a cemetery this doctor is indeed a bit strange Laguna honestly answered I'm not sure about that either but the place noted in the mission is indeed here suddenly they were startled by a tragic scream from behind aha Yu looked towards the source of the sound in Surprise exclaiming what a dreadful scream Laguna quickly ran over he shouted that's ly rang's voice something must have happened letun hurry over there the scene before them left them stunned a gigantic Beast wielding a large knife was approaching its mouth emanated a strong foul odor Luna exclaimed that's the immortal gravekeeper its level is 45 with immortality attributes belonging to the undan race the monster was getting closer to the person kneeling on the ground it looked at its victim with a greedy gaze mumbling meat blood the man knelt before it fearfully pleading no don't kill me Laguna ran over urgently calling out Li rang he turned to look panic-stricken raising his hands for help is it you guys hurry and save me I don't want to die yet Laguna said I'm coming right now Yu saw that he was about to run over there and quickly stopped him wait the opponent is a level 45 boss you are only level 25 how can you fight Laguna prepared to draw his sword turned his head to look at Yu and replied but if I don't go lyang will be killed Yu frowned you are level 25 so you should undertake missions suitable for level 25 this surely can't be an emergency right or are you taking risks to quickly achieve your goal of becoming an official Hunter by accepting a mission that isn't appropriate hearing this Laguna's expression changed slightly he lowered his head and admitted the level of this mission is from 25 to 45 I admit I have gambled a bit but I want to do my best to become an official Hunter so I took the risk to accept this Mission he continued with a sad tone but I didn't expect to actually encounter a level 45 Beast yiu gaped at him in astonishment after hearing Laguna finish speaking Yu could only hold his head and sigh you really are Reckless if you had met me wouldn't you be facing a level 45 Beast all by yourself the courage to fight in this level 20 Abyss is indeed quite like mine at this point yiu pause looked at lagona and then asked but I W ask honestly if you die on the mission how will the system handle it Laguna only scratched his head and smiled awkwardly isn't it that I've met you now haha if I really didn't meet anyone for help I could only take one step at a time plan one step at a time hearing this Yu didn't know what to say and could only shake his head helplessly at that moment the system answered his question initiating the main mission line if the mission Target dies the mission will be deemed a failure the owner will be p back to the real space and the current account will be forcibly deleted Yu's eyes widened in shock what you mean if the mission fails My Shadow King account will be deleted no way this is my trump card although it's expensive it has always soled every problem perfectly deleting the account I absolutely will not let that happen L rang hurriedly shouted hey everyone don't just talk anymore The Immortal Beast quickly swung its knife towards lyang as as the blade descended he was instantly obliterated lyang cried out help me it left gleefully looking at them and said die your flesh and blood will belong to me Laguna stepped forward gritting his teeth senior lyang I will face it headon he turned back to call Y wo vwoo you support from a distance y wo panicked raising his hand to stop wait don't act recklessly like that but it was too late he was secretly worried if you die my account will also be gone the immortal Beast continued its assault swinging its Knife Down Laguna quickly dodged to the side but didn't fully Escape he gritted his teeth stood up straight swung his sword and said although my level is only 25 don't underestimate me Yu saw a halo around lagona and became excited not bad at all facing a beast that's 20 levels higher without being at a disadvantage definitely not a chicken no wonder you will become the Shadow King in the future incredibly gifted The Immortal Beast was struck by Laguna's sword losing an arm two small skulls on its body immediately spewed out green liquid it roared in Fury go die chicken you will soon follow them lagona stood below staring up in panic he thought to himself it's over the range is too large there's no time to Dodge in a hurry Laguna used his cloak to Shield himself from the splattering fluids damn it although the Hunter's armor is effective against corrosion this corrosiveness is way too strong he looked at his health bar which only showed 60% left the immortal Beast holding a knife pointed at lagona and coldly said die Laguna was terrified completely powerless he can only watch as the sharp blade came down without having time to evade boom a loud explosion resounded Laguna was astonished to see an energy Shield appear around him blocking the Beast deadly blow it's yiwu yiu Stood Beside him activating a primary energy Shield level 35 with 40% energy left he shouted if you don't want to get hit quickly move away Laguna didn't dare to hesitate he immediately moved towards Yu as he reached the spot yiu set up a turret that fired continuously at the Beast Bang Bang the bullets hit the target causing the Beast to scream in agony oh oh oh but yuu was Furious to see the Monster using its powerful arms to Shield itself making the bullets unable to penetrate damn it my turret is clearly at the same level as it how come it can't deal damage ye W gritted his teeth his gaze cold preparing for another wave of attack Laguna quickly said the Beast is charging through here Yu think of a solution fast Yu threw out a small device looking dark and Grim he said I was planning to take it down with a magazine but after a fierce operation the damage seems negligible like I was just scratching it is this thing really immune to physical attacks the small device created a barrier trapping The Immortal Beast inside taking this opportunity y Wu pulled Luna to run away let's contain it first then we'll strategize a retreat while running Laguna said the Beast shouldn't be immune to physical attacks my sword clearly caused it harm just now what is going on yiu replied how would I know I just arrived at your place I'm still not used to it nor do I understand the properties of the monsters here at that moment a voice rang out a bunch of useless fools they stared in shock at the man sitting up from behind a coffin lid he shouted you can't even understand this and yet you want to be Hunters the two looked at him sweat pouring down their faces ah a zombie has come to life lagona pointed at him excitedly saying wait could you be Dr Victor the man angrily yelled why are you shouting like that I was hiding here but I truly can't bear to watch two DWTS like you Yu is still terrified when looking at Victor it seems this old man's survival skills in the wild are not to be underestimated ignoring the monster still trying to break through the barricade Dr Victor stood up looking at the two of them hiding next to the coffin and angrily said hey you twoo should hide a bit f further away don't put me at risk too who told you cowards to come rescue me not putting me in danger is thanks enough Yu looked up at him and asked Dr Victor we came to save you what do you know about this monster Dr Victor replied seriously that monster is originally the guardian of the cemetery after being infected by the plague origin and mutating it has s this still UND deteriorated corpses into its body it possesses immortality so normal physical attacks won't harm you need magic or physical attacks with attributes targeting it for them to be effective by the way the weapons of the hunting guild have been blessed by the high priest carrying holy attributes so they can injure it laguma nervously said is that so this is the first time I've heard of it hemp Dr Victor said sarcastically that's why they call you a coward ye will listen to him speak and pondered hearing him I just realized that all the accounts open now belong to the physical system perhaps I should also consider using all magic accounts wait speaking of immortal system monsters I remember that in the survival test at school it was mentioned that besides holy attribute magic and evil weapons healing magic could also cause damage so is that true Laguna seeing me silent for a while spoke up if that's the case iwoo why don't you try using my sword you would definitely use it better than I would he extended the sword towards me but I raised my hand to refuse no need I have a boulder method the Caged Beast was increasingly going wild screaming blood blood blood I looked at it and smirked you need blood right I will satisfy you I took out a level 50 healing potion and tossed it over eat my blood bottle the part of the Beast body that touched the blood immediately ignited ah the health of the immortal tombkeeper is down to 60% Laguna exclaimed an astonishment and yet with just one move I managed to reduce so much health y woo how did you do that what you threw is what I smirked if evil magic healing can cause damage then the blood bottle and evil magic definitely have no difference it seems I have won I never expected the effect to be so outstanding Dr Victor stepped up behind ywu his face frowning as if he was trying to endure something he Darkly said that's because recovery potions from level 50 and above carry inherent God attributes this is akin to being damaged by holy water bursts for Immortal type monsters at this point he widened his eyes and shouted kid you're only level 13 how could you have a level 50 recovery potion do you have any idea how valuable that is who would throw it away like that Yu looked at him calmly replied no need to worry he took out another vial a level 100 recovery potion and casually toyed with it in in his hands Yu continued I have a lot of this toy but if you want a finishing blow I need to use something higher Dr Victor exclaimed in shock what the Monster seeing the potion in his hand became terrified and hurriedly flood Yu quickly threw the potion towards it and said go a loud explosion rang out and thousands of souls flew from the Flames the monster was obliterated the system notification announced the immortal guardian's health is zero life index is zero the freed Soul smiled and said oh thank you Dr Victor looked at Yu who had just swiftly eliminated the monster and asked in astonishment so you really killed the Beast who on Earth are you ye wo looked at him and smiled happily I'm just an anonymous person a Drifter who has ended up here as he spoke he brushed off his hands and wait to Signal let's go Laguna has completed the mission Laguna cheered excited L his face full of enthusiasm yiu slipped his hands into his pockets and headed off listening to the system announc his points you killed a monster and received 20,000 experience points and 50,000 currency ywu sides softly this place truly is a land of blue skies and white clouds but after all these are just low-level monsters nothing to look forward to at least there's a consolation prize the system continued to announce you have picked up an EP IC level disease tissue this is a body part that fell from a high level mutated infected creature its true function is unknown but it definitely cannot be eaten Yu looked at the red heart in his hand and pondered it's not easy to come across an epic item yet it's something useless moreover this texture is quite strange suddenly Dr Victor approached closely his tone serious as he asked kid what kind of recovery potion did you just use I'd have spent my life researching countless types of medicine and while I can recognize their levels I cannot determine the exact type especially that last vile it's definitely not something someone like you could possess y Wu raised the heart what about this Laguna spoke up is Dr Victor also very curious didn't e wo already say that he comes from somewhere else moreover he has used many props that I have never seen before it's quite miraculous yiu stared at the heart once more and said that's right these are all Specialties from my hometown a place very far from where you are it's normal not to have seen them before Dr Victor was not easily swayed by yiwu he pointed and asked directly a young man who doesn't even know his way around yet has so many rare and peculiar props looks very suspicious what exactly is your purpose in coming here from such a distant Place Laguna feeling awkward for continuously questioning the person who had saved his life replied Dr Victor how can you say that although few people come from afar to our place I can assure you that ywu is definitely a good person he glared at Laguna whether he is a good person or not I will judge for myself at that moment he noticed the heart in Yi Wu's hand wait where did you get that thing Yi Wu answered this it's the diseased tissue that just fell off the monster do you know what it is used for Dr Victor stared at the object his face a mix of astonishment then said I came here specifically to seek it this disease tissue is an extremely rare specimen only obtainable from the corpses of deceased individuals because of it I have turned over every graveyard yet found nothing I never expected it to be on this monster Laguna confused scratched his head and asked is there a connection to the plague origin Dr Victor looked at him and patiently explained to be honest diseased tissue only has a very slim chance of appearing on the body of someone who died from the disease if I could obtain it it would be immensely important for researching the origins of our plague Yu listened staring intently at Dr Victor thinking finally the origin of the plague this time is also related to my purpose suddenly Dr Victor knelt down bowing his head before y woo pleading may I ask if you could spare it for me I would be willing to pay whatever amount you desire I would even bankrupt myself if necessary because it is crucial for me I have searched for it for nearly 2 years if I miss this opportunity I don't know if I can persist until I clarify the cause of the plague upon hearing Dr Victor's plea yiu quickly took out the heart and threw it towards him casely saying consider it free Dr Victor looked at him in astonishment what yiu smiled and replied normally I have the utmost respect for those who strive for their ideals you dare to face danger for the sake of researching epidemics even sacrificing ing your own assets your determination greatly impresses me why would I need your money hearing this Dr Victor felt extremely moved he said thank you not only do you understand the persistence in my career but you also have a compassionate and selfless heart he took the red heart in both hands and sincerely said to Yu please forgive my previous attitude you truly do not resemble those who chase after wealth yiu turned to Laguna furrowing his brow and asking what do you mean by that it sounds like your organization has issues laguma awkwardly explained there is a bit of a misunderstanding in this matter Dr Victor looked at Laguna with the Gaze of a grandfather teaching his grandchild Laguna you don't need to speak for them do you think that by joining the Hunter's Guild they will regard you with importance wake up you and they are not on the same path lagona lowered his head in silence Dr Victor continued saying that group of Beast faac people while claiming to protect our safety actually engages in a number of bad Deeds they bully men and intimidate women the town's folk bow their heads whenever they encounter them if they find someone even slightly displeasing they get beaten up and some even have to pay protection fees regularly yiu looked at Laguna and replied isn't this just like a tyrant although I had a bit of insight about those three from before Laguna hurriedly interrupted the hunter Guild I dreamt of is not like this I don't know when it began to Decay like this people like you y woo Who are both powerful and humble kind-hearted are becoming fewer and fewer at this point Laguna paused for a moment then Gathering all his determination he shouted since the day I joined the Hunter's Guild I vowed to change this chaos and restore it to its original sacred form Yu looked at him and could only smile Riley thinking to himself you really have a grand determination wanting to change the entire World Dr Victor walked ahead leading the way and said to them let's leave this place first and talk when we arrived I tied the carriage quite far away it should still be there yiu nodded and replied all right Laguna sat in the carriage and asked Dr Victor if you have been researching for so long do you have any clues about the origin of the plague Victor steering The Carriage replied to be honest it is embarrassing due to the lack of useful materials for for research to this day I still have not clarified the origin of the plague however on the contrary I have a few leads according to folk Legends the origin and spread of the plague are related to blood infection transmission Yu sitting next to him exclaimed blood infection transmission Victor nodded and continued explaining although I do not believe in this rumor I cannot dismiss it either after conducting research from various angles all the clues point to a mysterious organization known as the secret blood cult Laguna stood up abruptly and quickly asked the secret blood cult is it the mysterious organization that worships the ancient god blood in the Legends Victor glanced at him and replied that's correct but their activities are very unpredictable I have never seen them in person so the authenticity of this information still raises many doubts y Wu fell silent listening in his mind a thought flickered ancient god is it possible that ancient gods also exist in this world Victor continued in many villages and towns I have visited there is a saying when the situation of the epidemic is not too serious members of The Secret blood cult often come to treat patients the specific medicine they use is said to be related to the ancient god blood Dr Victor shook his head pondered for a moment then said actually the rumors about the secret blood cult are quite vague some people say that after being treated by the church patients not only recover but also become healthier however there are also those who after receiving the church's methods become mentally unstable and eventually turn into monsters I find it quite absurd to mention this but these are just rumors with no concrete evidence unless we find someone from the secret blood cult to verify then all of this is meaningless therefore if I have time I would also like to investigate them y woo upon hearing this immediately asked actually in our place we also have Legends related to ancient gods I wonder if among the ancient gods you mention there is anything similar to a luck horn Dr Victor calmly replied of course there is but we usually call it the thousand-eyed demon upon hearing this y Wu felt secretly delighted how fortunate this world even Ordinary People know the true name of the ancient god thus I should definitely be able to gather more useful information helping me prepare better when facing them in the future thinking this he quickly asked further do you know which ancient god the secret blood cult worships Dr Victor candidly replied of course I know its name is the Arcane Sovereign BS buub yiu suddenly thought the Arcane Sovereign beels buub this name sounds like a title of an ancient god but it carries an unsettling charm seeing this Laguna curiously asked what is this Arcane Sovereign you are talking about I've never heard of it y Wu immediately asked back you don't know Laguna replied ads for the secret blood cult I only know very little regarding their beliefs I am even less informed Dr Victor explained hemp from what I know the hunter Guild has quietly been investigating the secret blood cult for a long time if you don't know about this dare you say you're not isolated Laguna awkwardly responded ah perhaps it's because I haven't been officially promoted to a full member yet the system then announced the progress of the main quest line has been updated it is currently 2/3 completed youw thought I didn't expect it to update right at this moment this ancient god is surely going to be a pivotal point for me to become the Shadow King to complete the main quest line I must quickly find the Arcane Sovereign and facilitate their meeting while on the way youw asked Dr Victor about the ancient god and the rumors surrounding it the doctor quietly replied sha let's stop this topic here we've discussed enough ready if we keep going we might end up cursed Laguna heard this and curiously asked doctor you have always supported science and opposed to prostition so why are you afraid of being cursed this time Victor answered in a calm tone what is called science is not only based on results more importantly it is about the process and the attitude when faced with possibilities that are unclear before witnessing it with our own eyes or experiencing ourselves we cannot easily dismiss it after hearing this Laguna still felt vague and didn't fully understand the meaning however he sensed that the doctor's words seemed very profound yiu thought to himself in this complex world with feudal and Theological contexts having such an open-minded perspective is truly valuable the red moon illuminated the road as the group continued back to town at this moment Dr Victor gently reminded I've talked too much and feel a bit tired Laguna you take the rains I haven't slept for a few days and need to rest for a bit Laguna quickly replied all right it's still a bit far to the town and when we arrive I'll wake you up everyone had arrived at the hunter Guild branch in nille laguma said we have arrived this is indeed the main hall for discussions of the guild Branch yiu looked around and noticed it resembled a Tavern so he wondered Laguna laughed and said ha it does look a bit like that now let's go inside he turned around and called Dr Victor wake up as yiu stepped in he saw the tavern was quite crowded and asked what are those three counters for Lumin explained those three windows are for providing and accepting missions reporting missions and buying or trading items we will also need to report our mission this time after hearing that Yu said so it's not much different from a black market just that it's much more primitive looking up at the second floor he curiously asked what's up there Laguna replied that area is reserved for senior members of The Guild I have never been up there either suddenly a girl ran out calling father she recognized that it was Dr Marina's daughter and said father really has returned I was so worried the doctor smiled and responded why are you crying is that all you can do cry father is back safe and sound your father will never let anything happen Maya rubbed her eyes and gently said Thank You Laguna thanks to you I finally get to reunite with my dad Laguna felt a bit shy upon hearing this he awkwardly smiled actually I didn't do much the biggest credit goes to yiu hearing Yu's name Mana turned to look at him her eyes full of curiosity it seemed she and Yi Wu had never met before Yu replied in a calm voice it's just what I should do helping others is a joy especially when it's for a dedicated doctor like Dr Vic Mana felt even more embarrassed upon hearing this she lowered her head and softly said well I still have to thank you thank you for saving my father Mana glanced at Yi Wu once more in her heart she thought he really is a quite Charming guy thinking this she couldn't help but compare though Laguna is a bit more handsome the strong Aura of ywu truly captivates people suddenly a flurry of imaginative thoughts flashed through her her mind what if both of these guys were pursuing me what should I do it would be so hard to choose at that moment Dr vict approached pulling Mana out of her Daydream he reminded her his voice Stern your crush on handsome guys has flared up again if there's nothing going on don't go out to the lobby it's filled with a bunch of men who smell bad aren't you disgusted Maya blushed hearing this quickly leaving without daring to say another word Mana woke up right after being hit by her father it hurts so much isn't someone supposed to take care of others this Father and Son Duo turned their faces as quickly as they flipped their hands this time's Harvest is not small I need to grasp the time to return for research farewell for now ye woo if you're interested you're welcome to come visit my house is near the bell tower just go out of here and turn left for 200 M to reach it the father and son took their leave and Mana waved her hand you must come to my house you U saw this and could only express his resignation towards this Father and Son do ha I still need to think about whether to go or not leguna cheerfully said haha Mana has always been this way let's go it's time to take on the mission as Laguna was standing in the mission assignment Corridor someone suddenly called from behind oh isn't this Laguna you're still alive and back aille looked at Laguna with a sarcastic tone it truly surprises others previously will you took on on the higher level Mission we all thought you were sure to die what bad luck you've had Laguna replied you're not wrong I was truly very lucky the mission officer then called Laguna over and Laguna handed her the report book I guess here is the report of this Mission along with the designation of the three Fallen teammates the task assigner saw this and immediately panicked no way that is their signal from lyang the people around them were also alarmed both of them have died I heard they only went to carry out an extremely simple task Lumin explained I met them on the road and they said they would help me handle this task Unfortunately they ran into a highlevel variant and met with an accident I am very sorry that lie then accused lagona you were lying you must have plotted to harm them with your level how could you possibly complete this Mission Laguna retorted I did not harm them they sought their own Doom more moreover this time I had Yu's assistance and fortunately shua came to the rescue sadan stepped in to resolve the situation all right the mission has been completed as for whether he lied or not and the cause of ly rang's death we will investigate thoroughly ourselves there is no need for to bake here sadan congratulated Laguna congratulations Laguna from today onwards you are officially a hunter Laguna upon hearing this was delighted in said yes I am very honored saai and immediately raised his hand to cast the spell this was the tool used to perform the blessing ritual right shatina immediately praised Laguna saying well done keep it up I hope one day you will become the pride of the Hunter's Guild receiving such praise Luna felt a bit flustered and replied I I will do my best Captain aille seeing this burst out laughing derisively the light surrounding you is a soft pink huh Master this kit must be really excited right now you who stood there also feeling happy for Laguna he muttered oh it seems this is an important turning point in his life out of the blue chatina turned to look at Yu and said H are you being eyed by someone at level 150 saying that she suddenly moved closer to yiu causing him to awkwardly freeze Yu thought to himself what is she planning to do my current state is basically unable to confront her chitina tilted her head took a light breath and said stranger you have a very unusual scent about you the crowd began to stir as they saw chatina actively approaching Yu some people whispered chitina actually took the initiative to approach a stranger could it be that the captain has taken a liking to this kid no way chitina is my ultimate Idol how can I let a fool take her away seeing this shatina immediately said something that made everyone both scared and in awe of her coolness whoever makes noise again I will send that person to meet the ancient god diha upon hearing this covered his face and thought to himself why do I always end up provoking such focal characters is it possible that the canle aura around me cannot conceal this Yu then asked chatina you mentioned earlier that I have a strange scent what kind of scent is it shatina replied well I am very sensitive to sense just one whiff and I can remember it clearly but there is a smell on you that I have never encountered before youo hearing this forced a smile perhaps it's because I come from a different place chitina shook her head that's not it the scent on you is indeed very unusual but compared to the scent of someone from another place this feeling is more like a deep sense of distance hard to pinpoint youu suddenly felt flustered what is this girl's nose how can it be so sensitive could it be that she has discovered my otherworldly identity just by the scent Laguna sensing the atmosphere was a bit tense spoke up to explain chitina the captain although y Wu is from another place he is definitely of good person I can vouch for him chitina smiled I have no doubt about you ywo it's just that as you can see our place is not exactly friendly to Outsiders if you want to stay in this place for a long time it's best to have a convenient identity for example as a hunter chitina said surprising y woo if you're interested in participating I can make an exception and recommend you but y Wu firmly declined me a hunter thank you for your kindness but my rank is not eligible to be a hunter it would be better to find a lighter job Yu thought to himself isn't this just wanting to arrange me under their watch for easy monitoring everyone around was very surprised to hear him decline chatino was willing to recommend him he actually refused Am I Dreaming how dare he refuse chua's invitation one person couldn't help but feel angry I must kill him someone else quickly stopped him shut up be careful not to really anger sister there won't be a good ending Yu stood there knowing he could only remain silent he observed the surroundings for a moment and remarked this place is much more peaceful than the town ie previously visited there are very few people infected with the plague origin as for the special skill of the Shadow King Yi Wu remembered something that's right that special skill seems to stem from his this characteristic even blood can be easily consumed later Laguna responded perhaps it's because the previous Town didn't have a hunter's Guild wherever our Guild is present whether it's a powerful cult or a secret blood cult it's not easy for them to infiltrate naturally that place is much more stable upon hearing this ye woo had some speculation in its heart this situation further proves my guess about the origin of the pl according to the rumors he felt curious about the secret blood cult and asked do you really not know any more information about the secret blood cult Laguna replied I'm not sure but within the guild there must be more news when I reach a higher rank and have broader Authority I will definitely help you investigate Yu continued to ask but why are you m interested in such a cult ywu seem to be hiding something and replied Ambiguously it's nothing I was just asking casually suddenly a group of people burst through the door shouting loudly it's Laguna the one we called for we heard there's free alcohol here and a hunter who isn't afraid of getting drunk so we came to drink with lagona everyone in the group full of fighting Spirit chanted in unison who's afraid of whom we won't leave until we're drun today behold group responded all right we won't leave until we're drunk y woo seeing this immediately became cautious you guys drink slowly I don't even know how expensive things are in this world suddenly the system announced sarcastically V woo it seems you are looking down on my poverty the debts have increased again please regularly check your balance master yigu was annoyed I know already it's so annoying after drinking to their heart's content lagona said said a few words why woo you are being too modest with your abilities after joining the hunter Guild you should be able to level up quickly the basic rank shouldn't be a problem Yu replied you think too highly of me I really am not suited to be a hunter chitina seeing this did not press the man further if that's the case I won't insist if you change your mind you can always come to see me goodbye Serena also bid farewell to ywu young man if fate allows we will meet again Laguna however persisted in trying to persuade Yu once more y wo are you really not reconsidering this is an extremely rare opportunity leader chitina has never directly recommended anyone to join the hunter Guild yiu bluntly replied I've made up my mind don't persuade me anymore Laguna had no choice but to give in to Yu's determination all right fine Yu said nothing more only thinking doing self right now I don't have time to be a hunter I must find a way to speed up the main story line and leave this coersion as soon as possible Yu asked system what progress of the main quest line must be reached to return to the real world the system replied the progress of the first forc mission must reach 10% to return to reality upon hearing this Yu rejoiced only 10% then it should be completed quickly help me speed up the progress a bit at that moment Yu suddenly had a congratulatory message for Laguna everyone today is a joyful day for my brother today lagona officially becomes a hunter I hope everyone will support my brother in the future to show my sincerity I invite all of you here to drink tonight please feel free Laguna was taken AB a y woo isn't that a bit too extravagant hearing that everyone happily responded to Yu's Goodwill this brother of yours is amazing with such spirit I Luna pledged to support you waiter bring me 10 bottles of God blood from 82 today we won't go home until we are drunk anyone who doesn't get drunk is a turtle hiding in its shell aha Laguna felt a little shy I'm really sorry for this kind of extravagance Yu replied no need to be polite aren't you very concerned about the relationships among Hunters so let's take this opportunity to dispel all those worries Laguna felt that a thank you was not enough he sincerely said Thank You y woo you are truly thoughtful he opened the server and updated the mission progress currently the progress had only reached 6% in the festive atmosphere of the party the main character could not be absent everyone quickly pulled Laguna into the center Luna you were the main character why are you hiding here drinking come on over here Laguna awkwardly hesitated and replied wait a minute seeing my friend being pulled into the Lively scene I couldn't help but smile go on you were the center of attention tonight as everyone continued to raise their glasses in celebration I sat back in a corner to ponder this world is like a special dungeon if you can spend money here there must be a way to earn it too this is a once- in a-lifetime opportunity to build a base I need an enormous sum of 5 billion additionally I must bear a debt of 500 million with the current speed of making money it is certainly not enough I must make the most of this opportunity to earn a large sum while the people around continued to joyfully drink I was busy contemplating my next plan tomorrow I need to find Dr vict to ask for more information about the plague's origin I must find out its source and create a remedy afterwards I will sell this remedy to the nation that will be the way it help me Resolve my current financial difficulties he thought in this way I can save the people of this country ear a large sum of money without any effort truly one Arrow hits three Targets this alternate world is more meaningful than I imagined everyone was drinking without knowing when to stop continuously Downing their glasses he wondered who is left this is what number of glasses already Yu seeing this couldn't help but say this is the 10th glass he thought damn this kid's stomach is like a bottomless pit after a few drinks Laguna became quite arrogant you all are too weak trying to get me drunk you need to call a few more people over seeing this everyone took the opportunity to push further they said just wait we will go call more people Yu was a bit surprised and praised Luna I didn't expect your alcohol tolerance to be that good Laguna replied actually I've been like this since I was young no matter if it's water or liquor as long as it's a liquid I can drink it very well completely Without Limits suddenly a special announcement rang out due to the exchange rate disparity between this world and the real world the current rate is 1 to 1,000 therefore the 500 gold coins spent on drinks last night is equivalent to deducting 500,000 gold coins ywo shouted why didn't you mention something this important sooner if I had known the prices here were so high I wouldn't have wasted it like this Laguna pulled Yu asking what's wrong Yu you look out of spe did you not sleep well last night or would you like to take a little more time to rest there's no need to rush to Dr Victor's house Yu replied it's nothing just something else don't mind me I'm fine Laguna looked at him showing concern is it something related to the Hunter's Guild are you really not thinking at all about that I just want to say that if you're by maide I feel very reassured moreover if we work together on the mission it will surely go smoothly Yi Wu answered you don't need to worry about that although I haven't joined the hunter Guild as long as you need me I will act alongside you no matter what enemies we face you can charge ahead without concern I will support you with all my strength Laguna hearing this was delighted really thank you so much y woo we've only known each other for a short time yet you are so willing to help me I truly don't know how to express my gratitude enough yiu smiled and replied haha it's nothing I believe even fate as soon as I arrived in this foreign land I met you which shows we have a special connection but honestly I also don't know if I'm helping you or inadvertently pushing you toward a dark path perhaps I never realized that I myself am driving you towards such an outcome the updated report system shows that the current progress of the main task line has reached 8% Yu said no matter what let me walk with you on the final path of Destiny Luna replied the bell tower is here right Yu nodded yes it's here he called out loudly Dr Victor we have arrived a voice resonated from inside is that ywo the door isn't locked come in quickly yiu pushed the door open and stepped inside saying sorry for the interruption Mana saw him and her eyes went up welcome you two handsome guys do you want have breakfast first or do something else before she could finish Dr Victor interrupted gruffly saying Marina aren't you already embarrassed enough cough cough yeu notice something was off and asked doctor what's wrong with you you look worse than before Mana answered in his place father just got back yesterday and buried himself in research but there hasn't been any progress he's stuck there as a result he hasn't slept a wink all night no matter how much I advised him he wouldn't listen she paused for a moment and added oh have you two noticed if I change at all have you haven't you Victor pushed her away and said sternly stop spouting nonsense quickly go prepare breakfast I've told you already Mana smiled and said yes I will go right away Yu asked is there's something wrong in the research process Victor sighed and said to be honest I feel really embarrassed it's all my fault for not having enough ability if we want to analyze the internal structure of the pathological tissue we definitely need need to use a high Purity solvent even though I have intermediate drug formulation skills I spent the whole night but couldn't prepare a solvent with the required Purity this has led to no progress in the research y asked do you have a formulation map or should I give it a try Victor was surprised you understand about drug formulation yiu scratched his head just a bit hearing this Victor turned around and said no need I've already asked a friend from the formulation Association to come help matters related to medicine should be handled by professionals Yu nodded in agreement at that moment a voice rang out Victor old fellow you called me over so early because you're dealing with some trouble again why are you always so useless you keep making me cover for you Victor smiled and said Jose and master I can only rely on you host scoffed I'm very busy but out of respect for our friendship from school I came to help you Victor replied yes yes I'm bothering you Yu asked what is the background of this person are high level pharmacists very rare among you the demeanor of this Superior being is quite impressive Laguna replied right now because the plague origin is spreading the epidemic prevention medicine produced by the Royal pharmacist Association is extremely rare who wouldn't respect them a little bit y wondered since the epidemic prevention medicine is available haven't they found out the source of the toxin yet Lumin explained however the supply has been monopolized by other races prices have been consistently driven up and the status of the pharmacist Association has also risen accordingly y w thought it seems that there must be something concealed within this matter each highlevel pharmacist has such status so who is the master pharmacist in charge of making the medicine Laguna replied of course there is only one master pharmacist in the whole country the president of the royal pharmacists Association it is said that he has been brought into the palace to treat the diseases of the royal family his treatment is equivalent to that of an honored Minister ranking below one person but above Millions hearing this yeo's eyes brightened then my opportunity to make money has come as long as I reveal my identity as the master pharmacist wouldn't there be afraid of not having people bring thousands of gold to Curry favor with me y Wu silently vowed that plus the exchange rate differences he must prepare to make this huge amount of money he told himself thank you system I had wronged you before just in time the notification system activated the repair mission to eliminate the plague origin the current progress is 0% the side quest will not affect the return time he suddenly thought so there's a side quest too but luckily it won't delay the return time moreover it coincides perfectly with my purpose plus there's a chance to receive a nice reward suddenly a loud explosion rang out causing everyone to scream and panic be careful what the hell is this I almost lost my life Victor shook his head I didn't expect even you to fail the student helped to to his feet worriedly asking are you okay Co grumbled do I look okay to you even I can't formulate the Resonance of this disease tissue it seems the Purity isn't sufficient yet we'll have to invite the president to take action Victor question you mean invite the president but he's in the palace and ordinary people can't meet him besides can we even manage to invite him hose replied if we don't try how will we know it's all your damn toys that sparked my curiosity but I can't handle it if not the best expert in potion formulation then only the president can solve it before hose could finish y Wu smiled well then maybe not if you all are at loss why not let me give it a shot everyone was surprised a loud voice asked who are you hearing this the people around scolded this kind of academic experiment requires caution what does a stranger like you understand get out don't cause more trouble y Wu remained calm and replied you all say this is academic but if you prohibit experimentation how can you know right from wrong some were unhappy and interjected I don't understand what right do you have to speak here Victor stepped forward trying to mediate everyone please don't act rashly Yi Wu is my benefactor moreover the disease tissue we are using today was provided by him without his help this experiment could not have been carried out Co was surprised so the disease tissue was obtained by him Victor you're not lying to me are you Victor nodded answering firmly of course it's true thanks to Yu we obtained that advanced variant but he is after all someone from a different place and he is not familiar with the rules here please be more forgiving hosen looked at Yu and asked suspiciously do you really understand how to formulate medicine Yu smiled faintly and said just a bit of understanding another person scoffed and mocked kid youd better take care of yourself you look like someone who knows how to formulate medicine you don't have a whiff of medicine on you on the contrary all I smell is the scent of unprocessed milk haha Laguna frowned and said you don't understand anything y Wu is much more capable than you guys he was able to defeat that level 45 mutated Beast with just two potions another person interjected even if he's good at fighting making potions is a completely different matter I advise your friend not to embarrass himself and not to waste our time toes thought silently indeed recovery potions can harm the Immortal type monsters but to use two potions to eliminate a level 45 Immortal Beast it must be high-grade recovery potions at the very least these types of potions are not only rare but also extremely expensive this person is truly astonishing hos looked at Yi Wu and said kid if you claim to understand potion making you must know that in Academia we do not tolerate any deceit I can give you an opportunity but if you fail I will impose the strictest penalties even expulsion do you understand Yu calmly replied I understand that very well but what I want to know right now is if I succeed how much will my reward be lagona unexpectedly said Li woo do you really want to do this what if you get expelled the power of the royal pharmacist Association is quite significant hos laughed haha kid you're quite greedy but I don't dislike greedy people as long as they truly have enough capability if you can successfully analyze the disease tissue it will be a tremendous contribution to the research on the origin of the plague I will offer you 10,000 gold coins everyone was surprised to hear this 10,000 gold coins is equivalent to 10 years of their salary the Royal pharmacist Association is indeed generous yiu replied let's decide on that I am ready to begin ho said please but in his heart he thought it's just for show I've spent 10 years of hard training to achieve a high level of potion making even I can't do it how could a kid in his teens possibly accomplish it moreover many of the tools have been destroyed now in the meantime yiu began his research fortunately the system had automatically converted the language into a common style otherwise the writing of this other world would indeed be quite hard to understand looking at the documents on the preparation methods and mixing ratios yiu was confident that there would be no issues arising the main problem lay with the pharmacists themselves however in front of these people from another world using the abilities from his potion making account wouldn't be appropriate yiwu had no choice but to rely on manual work although Yi Wu had never used these tools before thanks to his enhanced accountabilities the medicinal materials and tools became as familiar to him as old friends everyone was amazed this kid is completely unlike someone from outside the industry and has no rank at all he must be very skilled Victor added his broadcasting work has been quite strong lately no wonder he is so confident however only Jose did not think KY of it he said this action is merely a basic operation the purity of the medicine is the only standard to test the final Effectiveness a moment later yiu presented a shimmering yellow vial it's done he said Jo's gassed unable to believe it how can this be I've tried many times but either the medicine lack Purity or when the Purity is too high it causes violent reactions and even explodes he snatched the vial and took it for testing can I do this if you say it's not possible let me verify whether it works or not everyone focused anxiously waiting as the medicine began to change they exclaimed in Surprise there's a change the solution is gradually harmonizing and transforming could it finally be a success look it seems there's another transformation he tried to concentrate and waited a little longer suddenly the mixture fell to the floor leaving everyone stunned what just happened how did it happen so quickly we didn't even have time to react hey that young man asked this thing won't move again will it Victor interrupted Don't Go Near it let me handle it I've already confirmed that it doesn't spread through the air but the risk of infection through close contact still exists ye W thought let's wait and see I've heard that the plague origin battle is related to an ancient god my next objective is to find the secret blood cult to learn more about the Arcane Sovereign boy N duck this is not only related to the main inside quest in this world but it also directly affects my personal safety she continued to analyze now I know news about two ancient gods but I'm completely in the dark about other matters are they hiding in the main world or in the subor I must take this opportunity to investigate clearly and come up with a countermeasure if not it's like having a blade hanging over my head which can cause danger at any time everyone was astonished and asked each other so this kid has really succeeded his potion making skills are truly incredible Jose also had to acknowledge I can't deny it I misjudged you really have talent and your strength even surpasses mine it's true that there are always higher mountains I never expected this to happen y Wu looked at H with a hint of Suspicion in his eyes you are young but your Proficiency in potion making is remarkably High you are indeed a talent however why have I never heard of you before Yu calmly replied it's because I do not care much about my reputation I only focus on the benefits so my fee Master you surely won't go back on your word will you hos nodded and responded of course not it's just that I haven't brought much money with me today here are 1,000 gold coins to give you up front I will settle the rest quickly don't worry I'm not a man of bad faith once I make a promise I never break it y w took the bag of money nodded and said no problem in his heart he happily thought being the pharmacist really is a fast way to make money moreover the exchange rate difference between these two worlds can help me reap quite a substantial profit in the future I must maximize my earning potential from this profession to suddenly displayed a warm sincere look and said said additionally I have a request I hope you can grant it Yi Wu decisively replied go ahead as long as it can earn me money everything is negotiable without hesitation Josie immediately responded I hope to invite you to join the Royal pharmacist Association would you accept the onlookers were stunned a master like Josie is inviting a young man to join the Royal pharmacist Association such treatment has never happened before how many people have have tried to get in and were turned away at the door yet Yu is being invited directly even so those witnessing it could not help but acknowledge the strength Yu displayed just now truly deserves this invitation yiu said this is somewhat beyond my expectations if you have invited me directly like this you must have prepared the conditions and corresponding benefits right Mr hos Co replied negotiating here is not appropriate let's discuss in my office please y Wu turned to ask Dr Victor and Laguna are you guys coming with me Laguna nodded yes I will go with you in contrast Dr Victor declined I still have to catch up on my research time I can't go with you however as Yi wui Laguna were about to enter the office they were blocked not allowed the association has regulations prohibiting hunters from entering the association the staff said ye W question why is the relationship between your church and the pharmacist Association not good lagon explained the internal reasons are somewhat complex I don't quite know either Yu said to Jose lagona is my good brother he must accompany me the staff seemed hesitant but ghost casually said no problem if we want to negotiate I should show some sincerity however I hope this friend of yours can conceal a hunter's weapon to avoid unnecessary trouble after that he invited both to the carriage the association's branch is a little ways away you two follow me and ride in the carriage Yi Wu responded then I will obey on the car Yi Wu questioned earlier you said this place is a branch Mr go replied that's right the Royal pharmacist Association has branches all over the country I grew up in this town so I was appointed as the head of this Branch by the way the headquarters of the pharmacists Association is Loc ated in the Imperial City about 2 or 3 days journey from here yiu said the Imperial City H if I get the chance I definitely have to take a trick there before long they arrived in front of the branch Yi Wu exclaimed even the branch has such grandure it's no wonder the Royal pharmacist Association is so wealthy and dignified within the palace Mr go replied for the pharmacist Association no matter how luxurious the facilities are they are useless you out iders wait out here without my permission no one is allowed to enter the office understood the subordinates replied in unison yes y wo added once inside the office y woo opened the conversation seeing your mysterious demeanor you surely have deeper intentions I don't like beating around the bush just speak plainly you want me to join the Royal pharmacist Association so what is your goal hearing that Mr Bose was somewhat pleased and replied you are very intelligent and I enjoy associating with intelligent people so I will get straight to the point I want you to help me become the new president of the royal pharmacist Association Laguna sock said what Yu suddenly asked hauh then why did you choose me I am from another place and I heard that this place is very unfriendly to Outsiders Mr G calmly replied it is precisely because you are an outsider that you are more suitable your background is clean not belonging to any Force only someone like you can I trust but this is just one of the factors the most important thing is that your strength is enough to stand alongside the president I need your abilities y Wu continued to question if you think I already have such abilities why should I help you wouldn't it be better for me to become the president myself Mr goza took a deep breath and then responded I can see that you are not that kind of person you are not the type who has Ambitions for power and Status moreover you are just an outsider here with no place to rely on no matter how great your skills are without connections and supporting resources it would be difficult to advance far in the field of medicine you are an intelligent person and you surely understand this principle I can satisfy your desire for wealth as long as you help me become the new president in the future half of the association's income will belong to you Laguna was shocked to hear such conditions even if it's just half of the income that's still an incredibly large number to the point of being hard to believe this is really suspicious y Wu also thought similarly as soon as he arrived he propose such significant benefits it's hard not to raise suspicions ail beside them said but Master judging by his expression he doesn't seem to be lying yugu asked to climb to the position of President while being willing to give up enormous profits that seems somewhat contradictory what's his true motivation Mr go responded it may seem contradictory but Fame and profit can be clearly distinguished you pursue profit while what I seek is Fame he continued the Royal pharmacist Association has become corrupted even decadent since the current president took office he has colluded with the nobility exploiting the Monopoly on drug production to reap enormous profits after the outbreak this phenomenon has only worsened I still remember vividly my mother died because we couldn't afford medicine I vowed before her corpse that I would become an exceptional pharmacist creating drugs that Ordinary People could afford he continued but the more I strive the deeper I sink into the Vortex of enormous interests that cannot be changed even if I become a senior pharmacist I can only go along with the crowd colluding and wrongdoing if not I will be consumed by it he paused for a moment then pointed at ywu now there is an opportunity to turn the tide Mr ywu with your master formulation skills combined with my resources and networks we can completely collaborate as long as we research and develop a real cure for the plague origin we can suppress the president's reputation from there we can overthrow him and gain the dominant rights of the pharmacist Association do you agree to help me with this ail standing next to Yu spoke up this dialogue may sound very fake but I have verified it three times this old man is not lying it is true y wo fell silent for a moment before speaking although your purpose is filled with grand ideals and righteousness I support your decision after all it is becoming increasingly rare for someone in a high position like you to still maintain a conscience moreover having the opportunity to earn money while saving people I have no reason to refuse he shook hands with Mr Jose the latter full of gratitude said that's wonderful thank you y woo I assure you that I will definitely keep my word however there is one thing I must apologize to you for previously I promised to give you 10,000 gold coins but I'm afraid it may not be possible to settle it immediately I currently only have 4,000 gold coins available this is all the money I can mobilize at the moment although my income is quite High most of it goes towards providing free medicinal preparations for Victor to help treat the poor as for the remaining 5,000 gold coins I asked for a little time to make up for it yugu replied it's fine you can cover the remaining amount with the potion formulation maps and necessary materials but it would be best to have high level or Master Level Maps Mr go expressed his appreciation saying thank you for your understanding the maps and materials you're aiming for you can take however some valuable Master Level maps are kept in the association's treasury as long as I am still a president you will have the freedom to choose Yi Wu agreed and said then let's decide on that Mr go also nodded in agreement all right a deal is a deal after finishing the negotiations it was late and the blood moon was overhead Yi Wu and Laguna walked home together Yi Wu remarked is it already this late Laguna replied that's right you two were quite animated in your conversation but most of the academic issues left me confused Yu suddenly spoke up are you hungry how about we go to the best restaurant in town for a meal I have now lagona laughed harly haha if you have money go ahead and enjoy it however on their way the two were blocked by a group of strangers both were startled ywu asked loudly who are you before he could finish his sentence the group rushed in to attack Laguna immediately drove his sword to Parry the first blow he warned vwu be careful with just one block strike Laguna's Health dropped to 30% youu looked at the unexpected situation and quickly activated his electric shield and brandished a level 45 weapon he was worried could these be members of The Secret blood cult I never expected them to come after us so quickly the group of strangers swung their arms shattering the electric shield in just one second Yu exclaimed in astonishment so fast their strength is too powerful their level is much higher than ours as yiu was lost in thought Laguna pushed him to the side he shouted woo run quickly I will hold them off Yi Wu wanted to stop him and hurriedly said Laguna don't do anything foolish we can't win against them in the T situation the system notification rang out Quest progress updated to 10% criteria met for return the host will immediately return to the real world ye woo hearing this was at loss for words and irritably exclaimed what the hell is this why does it have to happen right now now he yelled back Laguna wait for me but immediately y Wu was pulled back into the real world baby Beetle saw him wake up and asked V Woo you're awake but who is Laguna jiwang Chun stood in front of him serious you suddenly fainted I thought something unexpected had happened but now it seems you are fine Yu was still dazed his mind in turmoil finally I've returned to the real world but why it's such a crucial moment he asked how long was I out baby beo replied it must have been a while after the red blood faded we found you unconscious on the ground as we rushed over you woke up Yu pondered and realized that time in the other world seemed to have temporarily stopped he silently asked the system system what is the situation in Laguna's world now the system responded after the host leaves time in the Shadow King world will temporarily pause however since the quest line has not yet concluded the host will be forcibly teleported back there again after 240 hours Yu thought once I'm forced by the teleportation Talisman won't I return to the moment when the three black clad assassins Ambush me Laguna's life is hanging by a thread I must find a way to break this impass it seems the next 10 days will be crucial during this time I need to proactively maximize the offensive capabilities of the account the Alchemy Master otherwise I'll be dead as soon as I come back jiw chewan seeing Yi Wu's dazed expression curiously asked why are you thinking so intently about facing a pile of equipment and acting so nonchalant is unlike you at all y was taken aback by the question then laughed haha perhaps it's a side effect from using that ultimate move earlier I'm still feeling a bit dazed but this time we all experienced life and death together especially since I've used up all my reserved ultimate moves there are no more secrets between us how about we form an alliance ye we suggested on the surface I still maintain a nonent attitude but I am silently proposing to share intelligence and resources so we can become stronger together what do you think G Chuan calmly replied if you still have the mindset to utter these deceptive words it seems your mind has come back to its senses upon hearing this yiu merely chuckled haha Sulu also said you should try to befriend me although I helped you during the last battle that doesn't mean I will continue to do so in the future friends today can become enemies tomorrow so I hope you remember my words hearing these outright rejections yiu thought to himself tesk these people are really not easy to deceive Sulu interjected her tone filled with implication however your ultimate move truly opened my eyes 200 million is indeed worth it she approached Yu gently kissing his hand as a mark then she leaned closer touching his forehead and leaving a snowflake shaped mark this debt is not settled yet 200 million and that strike I have noted down don't hope to escape easily Sulu smiled and continued this magic will follow you to the ends of the Earth even if you hide underground I am willing to dig 3 m of land to find you hearing this Yu reacted oh Sulu transformed into snow and gradually melted into the air she said to ywo let me give you a sincere piece of advice after this battle you will definitely attract the attention of the high- ranking figures of Huong Jang be careful not to let them scheme against you otherwise if you die I won't know we' asked for my debt upon hearing sulu's words y Wu thought to himself do I need to be this cautious I'm not the kind of person who doesn't repay my debts even though she didn't specify the time frame for repayment it seems quite chivalrous considering the worsening relationship ship between hanm Mo and Juan Jen perhaps I will meet her again soon who knows they might even send her to assassinate me after that Yu spoke well I'm going go pick up the equipment now ji Wang Chun agreed go ahead thanks to you we were able to defeat the boss so that reward belongs to you at that moment the system's voice sounded congratulations to the host for defeating the final boss of the dungeon receiving a reward of 50 million a bonus of 100 million particularly Unlocking The Shadow King with a consumption of 700 million however because the completion speed of the main mission line of the Shadow King reached 10% the consumption has been correspondingly Exempted the actual amount now only remains at 630 million upon hearing about the discount yugu couldn't help but feel delighted he thought completing the main task line and still getting a discount so if I achieve 100% can I get back the money I've spent however the systems response quickly extinguished the budding dream the consumed portion will definitely not be refunded please don't dream ywo pouted hemp the equipment he received included insect Gods limb a crafting material that is extremely sharp can be used to craft weapons and enhance attack power insect Gods giant Wings a crafting material of soft transparent insect wings that can be used to craft weapons enhancing the agility and fence attributes of the equipment epic poison magic Crystal x800 additionally there is black slate X3 an old mysterious broken stone slab that seems to have some strange symbols drawn on it if a sufficient quantity is assembled unexpected events might occur Oswald's helmet when worn seems to turn one into a schemy individual enhancing intellect used for Alchemy and potion making the power of construction tools increases by 30% receiving this equ equipment Yu was so delighted that his mouth fell open this equipment has arrived just in time although its appearance is a bit ugly as long as I turn off the effect of the helmet I won't see it anymore system notification for the next equipment magic sword cardier this magic sword is covered by cursed energy and using it requires a strong mental preparation attributes when attacking there is a high chance of inflicting additional curse effects on the enemy The Curse includes significantly reducing movement speed speed and causing random damage every 5 Seconds raging from 1% to 50% of the current life value upon receiving this sword YW thought I can give it to kaixi to take advantage of her passive ability enhancing the curse effect suitable for the swords characteristics system notification star Bal is another piece of equipment this bow has a dazzling appearance shimmering with Brilliance reminiscent of the legendary elves attributes when attacking the bow creates armor breaking effects which can stack increasing the physical damage that the target suffers Yu thought this weapon can be given to yanf as the armor breaking effect will provide great support system notification insect God barrier the insect God barrier is made from the exoskeleton of the insect God this is a defensive piece of equipment that helps enhance resilience despite its large size this Shield is light and easy to use YW thought l Fang who takes on the main tank role in the team should also switch to a new piece of equipment system notification next is summon magic Crystal this equipment allows the summoning of a large number of insects to Aid in battle however only those with Royal bloodline of the insect species can use it the notification system potion recipe for making thousands of insect poisons after gathering enough types of insect poison you can craft a legendary potion that allows you to unleash debuffs combined from multiple types of insect poison the dungeon key proves you are the master of the dungeon by using this key you can teleport to the dungeon at any time after reviewing all the equipment yiu exclaimed NY this time the loot has all practical uses nothing is Superfluous the most important thing is this dungeon key and the legendary blueprint y wo thought to himself with this poison the chance of survival in the Haunted World is significantly increased moreover oswal's hat enhances the potency of the poison at this rate they want to turn me into a deathly poison Master as long as I survive even ancient gods can be killed by my poison thinking of this he laughed with joy around him a wave of dark energy spread leaving G wine Chun and the baby Beetle speechless the baby Beetle looked at y Wu concerned y y woo why you look so scary G1 Chu and shook his head helplessly thinking what weird idea is he coming up with again Yi Wu quickly shook off his dark thoughts he turned to G wine Chuan and asked ah Captain G how you think we should divide this loot in his heart he thought I almost got too pleased with myself I need to ask him first before I can divide things G Wang Chun replied as I said before you could take any equipment and items you want I just need the black slate and the dungeon key y Wu responded ah but what I need need most is actually the dungeon key G cheu and asked what do you want the dungeon key for Yu answered oh it's for some personal matter seeing this G Wang chuman said that's not possible the dungeon key is designated by Young Master Mo I don't have the authority to share it with you but if you really want it there's a way to join the mo attack team and become one of Mo Key's people if he's happy he might just give you the dungeon key hearing this proposal y Wu felt a sense of confusion half of this sounds like a lure and half seems like a threat if I refuse now it'll be like openly confronting mokai but if I agree wouldn't that be betraying Moki I absolutely will not do something that goes against trust and morality he asked the system can I still use the Shadow King account now G Wang Chuan said no because we are currently carrying out the trial Mission during this period we cannot use the Shadow King only after the the main mission line reaches 50% can it be used again seeing Yu's lack of response GW Chuan continued what do you think there's no need to rush your answer we can discuss it more thoroughly okay Yi Wu responded okay give me some more time to think he thought to himself in the current situation I cannot turn against G Wang Chuan and moay yet I will definitely not take any risks to snatch the dungeon key and put everyone in danger is not worth it the the only measure right now is to maintain stability after that I will find a way to approach moai to go deeper baby Beetle looked at everyone and said seriously I roughly understand the significance of the dungeon key you are talking about but the world of the insect species does not belong to anyone if it has to belong to someone he paused for a moment then pointed at yiu then it can only belong to yiu only he deserves to be the king of our world yiu was stunned his mouth a gap when his name was called Gang Chun looked at him and calmly said from your perspective that is indeed the case especially now you are still the nominal hair to the throne of the insect species but unfortunately this world or rather the entire operating rules of it have undergone fundamental changes G wine Chuan paused for a moment took out a small key with a strange pattern and said seriously a tiny key can determine the fate of the world owned by its possession quite amusing isn't it but this joke actually exists faced with this unchangeable reality we humans can only go with the flow the insect species can do the same y wo quickly continued the world of yours is merely a dungeon in our eyes yet the world of ours may just be a dungeon in the eyes of more advanced beings baby Beetle clasped his hands and bowed his head speaking helplessly ah what you were saying is really profound I can't understand it it y wo approached baby Beal patted him on the shoulder and Chu lightly you don't need to force yourself to think too much Awakening independent Consciousness is extremely difficult even Among Us humans there are not many who can achieve it in some respects Oswald is indeed a genius based solely on his own research he discovered the secrets of the world and he almost broke the barrier of space baby Beetle nodded in agreement uncle is indeed a rare genius it's it's just a Pity that he chose the wrong path otherwise he truly could have led our insect species to Glory while the two were chatting G Wang Chuan finished activating the system and looked at them saying there's no point in discussing this now let's go y woo the teleportation Talisman has been completed on Li Jess side you looked at him and replied Captain G you go ahead I promised baby Beetle that I would help it bury its teacher moreover the final boss has been defeated and all the debuffs on us have disappeared I don't think it would be a problem if I come back a bit late right hearing this G Wang Chun quickly turned around but didn't forget to say the company isn't that stingy I will report the entire process of this dungeon Mission honestly and I won't take credit for your work y Wu waved his hand to say goodbye thank you so much and by the way he suddenly stepped forward and hurriedly added Yin Juan about her GW Chuan understood the implication without needing to hear the whole sentence he smiled lightly and replied I will make sure she returns to the team I won't let your good intentions go to waste in Wang chuan's heart he thought I wonder whether meeting Mi Wu is a blessing or a misfortune for yinan y Wu followed the back of G Wang Chuan and thought after some time together I feel that g Wang chuan's thoughts are not as bad as I initially thought except for his somewhat unique personality in other aspects he is even quite simple-minded it can be seen that he is a person worth befriending and I hope that I won't have to confront him directly in the future after thinking idly Yu turned to Baby Beal and said let's go baby Beetle you should go bury your teacher now baby Beal seeing Yu stay with him quickly asked what about my sister and the team members of your squad Yu quickly replied no need to worry in a moment I will contact Juan how to take them away first suddenly a large Sandstorm monster emerged from the ground you who gazed at it in astonishment this guy is still alive baby Beetle looked at the monster and said sternly just in time for me to settle old scores however the sandstorm Incubus did not attack instead it bowed its head before them and emitted strange sounds Yu was puzzled and spoke hm what is it doing then the sandstorm in cubis spoke a series of strange words Yu didn't understand and turned to Baby Beetle saying translate for me what is it saying baby Beatle honestly replied it says it is willing to serve you as a subordinate hoping you can spare its life ywu pointed at the baby Beetle and said to it the one you should serve is not me but it it is the king of your insect species before you devoured it and in the future you must repay it double after y wo finished speaking the frenzied sandstorm Incubus nodded wildly indicating that it understood the baby Beetle looked at this large Beast unsure of what to say ye would notice that from the snout of the frenzied Sandstorm in cubis a heap of substances was spewing out he exclaimed in astonishment wait its appearance May W Wonder could it be that it has devoured so many things already the baby Beetle looked seriously at the frenzied Sandstorm Incubus and replied considering its long existence the quantity is probably difficult to estimate y Wu commanded baby Beetle go check what it is regurgitating and help me sort through it the baby Beetle stared at him in Surprise and asked why does it have to be me the system continuously announced the treasures obtained congratulations host has received epic gr magic crystals level 100x 500 reward 50 million the scepter of the mother Priestess goddess magic wand of the sectarian priest who reveres the goddess of of the earth containing powerful Life Energy it has the ability to significantly shorten the time to reduce magic consume mana and increase damage when using nature system spells the notification system The Witch's robe is a magical cloak that a famous

nature-based magic intermediate upon use players can acquire intermediate level magical skills such as intermediate level storm poisonous fungus Vine entanglement summon tree man and so on you who looked at these artifacts pondering while murmuring are these all Mage equipment is this Heaven's way of hinting that I should open a mage account the two rode the Raging Sandstorm Incubus and began to move Yu stood with arms crossed smiling and said then let's set off baby beetle you lead the way baby Beetle quickly pointed ahead responding yes we are going to shabow the Raging Sandstorm Incubus replied to the command and rushed forward upon hearing the new name of the Beast yiu was momentarily speechless shabow it seems this naming art has been inherited quite well the moon had risen High the house beneath the waterfall was lit up baby Beetle looked towards it and said this is where the teacher crossed over he considers this place place his second Homeland yiu looked around and nodded in agreement this place is Lush and picturesque truly makes one feel at peace it is indeed a Fitting Place for seclusion beside the house stood a tall grave on which lay the large sword of the teacher baby Beetle knelt before the grave sincerely praying teacher please rest in peace Yu Stood Beside him smiled and said the body can return to its second Homeland teacher you have not taught your student in vain he gazed at the surrounding scenery and continued being buried in such a lush and picturesque place the teacher must surely be very happy unlike our world where one cannot choose where to die or be buried upon hearing this baby be asked in your world are there really no such beautiful sites as this y Wu nodded and replied that's right a massive battle has completely changed our world those who are still alive must construct strongholds made of steel and concrete the places outside the realm of humanity seem to have turned into wastelands the natural scenery like here has long since vanished he paused for a moment then thoughtfully added your world has now restored peace but our world must continue to strive forward perhaps in the future we will face even more severe and latent dangers than we do now y Wu clenched his fists tightly his face filled with determination to fight for the country baby Beetle seeing this also tightened his fists into a ball PA and said why woo if that day ever comes I will not hesitate to give my life for you yiu smiled and shook his head thank you baby Beetle but what you said sounds a bit too sentimental I am not the kind of person who is easily moved or weak perhaps this scene is making us soft-hearted but this is not the time to be sad didn't we get a key from teacher before we still haven't found where to use it how about we try searching in his room we might discover something baby Beetle nodded all right let's quickly search the house the two began rumaging through every corner of the House suddenly baby Beetle exclaimed I found it he held up a wooden box and placed it on the table this must be the key to this box yiu looked at the box and nodded inde it's here open it and see what's inside baby Beetle opened the box and took out a scroll he looked at it and said there is only a scroll in the box but the writing on it is in your human language teacher taught me but I couldn't learn it Yu cheerfully said let me see it so I can read what it says in the painting there is only one line of text the god Spirit of the insect species is the stable Foundation of this world but it is not the only existence because I would saw a stone like that in the original World y wo exclaimed in astonishment does the sword sink also study the god Spirit there's a similar object exist in the human world what on Earth is happening the ancient story of teacher baby Beal which he roped down tells I once served as the commander of the palace guard of the Capitol Palace thanks to being close to the emperor I had the opportunity to come into contact with some national Secrets One Day the famous flying Bandit of the Marshal World sneaked into the capitol Palace to steal a treasure box I fought fiercely with him and had to go through great difficulty to retrieve that treasure box when I returned the treasure box to his majesty it was at that moment that I saw it although I only caught a fleeting Glimpse the image remains etched in my mind Looking Back Now despite some slight differences there is no doubt that it was the god Spirit King of the insect species that you once showed me he paused his expression thoughtful two worlds two pieces of mysterious crystals that are alike what hidden meaning and connection lie within this if we can understand the secret within perhaps I would create the opportunity to return to the original World the teacher of the baby Beal for this reason sat down and wrote down everything he knew on a scroll carrying both doubt and hope I began a series of secret investigations I asked the insect cane for assistance in examining the ancient books of the insect species while also observing Oswald's experiments in the dark eventually I reached a conclusion the crystal that the insect species calls God's spirit is actually the foundation of the dimension it possesses enough power to stabilize space and sustain the existence of the entire world once the crystal is damaged the entire Dimension could collapse I believe that if each world has such a foundation perhaps we can find a way to return to the original world but the lifespan of humans is truly too short one can imagine the image of the old teacher looking out the window longing for his homeland in the end I accepted the renovation proposal transforming into the insect species of Oswald I truly hope that in the remaining years of my life I can see the willow tree in my homeland once more the baby Beetle saw y Wu finish reading his teacher story and asked G woo what is written in the teacher's book although the teacher has taught me the characters of your people before I am a completely foolish student who understands nothing at all y wo held the scroll in his hand thought for a moment and said it turns out there is a second God Spirit Crystal this is definitely not a coincidence the world truly before the lone came to the Earth Network era if that world also possessed God's spirit crystals just like in the dungeon can we assert that every time an independent space has this as well YW stare at the green stone in his hand if this is true then does it have any connection to the hypothesis about the reboot of the muw world he handed the green gem back to Baby Beetle while advising on this stone is the key research of my teacher about God's spirit in short this God's spirit is related to the foundation and and stability of your insect species world you must keep it safe baby Beetle received the stone and nodded yes I will definitely keep it safe Yu looked inside the house for a moment then continued while your mother is still not awake let's take a walk by the lake it's been a long time since I relaxed baby Beetle looked at him and then spoke okay what you woo will you leave later the two of them reached the riverbank and baby Beetle feeling down C said so if in the end you can't get the key to this world you won't come back anymore we might never meet again Yu looked ahead and calmly said theoretically that's true although it's quite cruel possessing your world is determined by the dungeon key if the person using the key is not me I will not be able to return to this place anymore but you can rest assured Yu glanced at baby Beal and said seriously I absolutely will not let this happen the most important purpose of my arrival here is to obtain the dungeon key baby Beetle joyfully asked really will you bring everyone here will miss yanf come too Yu replied happily after all this place is the best shelter I have chosen it for everyone and will definitely not let anyone else interfere furthermore now I have a trustworthy good brother like you he recalled the scenes of war in the outside world and added of course my world is also filled with enormous and unpredictable dangers I must find a safe place for everyone to reside and at that time I will have to trouble you baby Beetle hearing yo say this baby Beetle joyfully replied you can count on me ywo it seems we must quickly rebuild the palace now we absolutely cannot let Miss yanf arrive without a capital palace to stay in that would be too disrespectful y woo had realized the key point he looked at baby bee who was so excited that he was about to jump up and said huh kid you must be thrilled to hear this right at that moment a voice called out from behind a hem baby Beetle baby Beetle and Yu were startled and turned around baby Beetle exclaimed mother you're awake yiu smiled and said just in time not much different from the time I expected baby Beetle hurriedly ran to help his mother up saying but your level has dropped down to 100 now all Mark baby beetles mother at that moment had only 1% health and life statistics left she reassured her son it's okay that's a side effect of losing the Zerg essence you don't need to worry finally we can be reunited in peace for me that's more important than anything else baby Beetle quickly took a green gem and handed it to his mother mother quickly absorb the Zerg Essence even if you can't return to your Peak State you will be much stronger than now allmark looked at her son and smiled no need this Zerg Essence doesn't mean much to me she continued to look at baby Beal and said our world has restored peace and you have grown enough to lead the insect species toward a hopeful future I no longer need to fight anymore perhaps I should transfer some of this strength to she turned to Yu holding his hand to show intimacy and said a hero needs and deserves to be blessed Yu's face was stunned he looked at her in amazement and asked huh are you also giving me your Zerg Essence this is not quite appropriate is it allmark smiled and replied my choice is not wrong even the wind and moon agree with my actions she placed the gem in Yu's hand and continued you don't need to worry you and baby beetle have a blood contract connection which will help you absorb the energy of this Zur gasin baby Beetle hearing her mother say so step forward to place the gem directly into Yu's hand that's right Yu this Zerg Essence is the crystallization of my mother's magic accumulated over thousands of years absorbing it you will gain my mother's Millennia of magical power which will definitely help you cope with future battlefields Yi Wu accepted the Green Gem and said if both of you say so then I will not refuse any longer thank you alar cap said we should be the ones to thank you without you our world would still be a dark place and mother and I would never be able to reunite baby Beetle Stood Beside her mother and added that's right but this great favor cannot be repaid you should quickly absorb this Zerg Essence Yu tightly gried the stone in his hand sensing its flow of power is this the power of magic until now I've always been a physical attacker I wonder what it feels like to use this ancient magical energy yiu Lean Forward absorbing the strength experiencing a sensation he had never felt before as the power naturally resonated with in his body baby Beetle exclaimed in amazement what is happening how can his Fusion probability with the Zerg Essence be so high allar raised a finger to his lips to Signal him to be quiet sha don't disturb him the natural magic is resonating with yiu soul this is the most crucial moment yiwu's eyes widened astonished as he thought so this is what it feels like to have infinite magic energy fill my body is this the Rhythm that wants to force me to change class yuu looked around in Surprise wondering Mom why did I directly enter the system space the system notification echoed detecting that the host possesses powerful magic energy which has triggered a resonance response from a special account would you like to unlock it immediately Yu stood before a large panel that was locked pondering is it possible for the account to actively seek me out could it be a special account like the shadow cane the system continued to resonate although the account is special its type is not the same as Shadow cane unlocking the account does not require spending money or experience points just the transmission of the necessary magical power yiu quickly transmitted magical power into the card and smiled saying is there such a good thing my magical power is abundant right now so this is just like having no need for money right system unlock the account the system quickly responded unlocking please wait the card opened revealing the accounts of twin witches ail and avra hu was so angry that he wanted to curse someone what is this why does it open a female account information on the card displayed female twins evil and avra the strongest sorceresses control light and darkness however due to the existence of two conflicting attributes within them they have split into two different personalities the light sorceress ail has a fiery and passionate personality like the sun the dark sorceress avra meanwhile is gloomy and cold like the moon when using the account players will experience Transformations following the cycles of Sunrise and moonrise causing the two personalities to change continuously in terms of abilities in addition to mastering various Advanced magic attributes players can also use Supreme Magic based on the differences between the personalities the notification system said in addition when using this special account there is no need to consume money and experience points you only need to expend high level Mana value and you will regain Mana after defeating any enemy ye thought expend high level Mana value although I have primarily focused on physical attacks and hardly touched Mana value before after absorbing a millennium's worth of Mana value from the Zerg Essence even though I tried to unlock the twin witch account this Mana value is still completely sufficient it's just right to compensate for the inability to use the shadow cane however whether it's the CH Emperor or the Shadow King when transforming there will always be some changes based on appearance linked to the account if this female account makes me wear female clothes just imagining myself transforming into the character on this card has made me blush and embarrassment ah that image is too beautiful I don't dare to think further at this moment the system chimed in you're overthinking it even if the host wants to wear female clothes it cannot be realized Yi Wu quickly reacted denying I don't want to I haven't the system continued to explain the method of using this account is divided into two types the first type is to directly use the magical power of the account the second type is to expend a large amount of man of value to summon the magical female embodiment the notification system when it appears it immediately causes Supreme magical damage capable of following any Arrangement you make and Lasting for an hour y wo upon hearing ing this scratched his head and sighed in relief pH that's good at least I don't have to wear women's clothes that's already a stroke of luck if not I would have to abandon this account I Vis hearing this complained is this really the point even given the opportunity you still don't appreciate your master baby Beetle called out in confusion Li woo Yu returned to the present baby Beetle looked at y wo and asked how do you feel now after absorbing the deser Essence y Wu replied happily it's incredible I feel like my body is filled with boundless magical energy thank you all for helping me become stronger allar standing beside him looked at him and said no need to thank us but this magical energy is still far from being endless it's merely accumulated over a thousand years ye W smiled at baby Beal well it's time for me to leave after I go outside it might be a long time before we meet again you all must take care baby Beetle held Yu's hand tightly determined as she said I will definitely make it you must come back soon y wo held baby Beetle's hand smiling brightly now you are the new king of the insect species let's share the responsibility with mother and make this world a better place baby Beetle nodded her eyes filled with confidence of course when you bring everyone back the changes in this world will surely Amaze you you who stepped into the beam of light light waving goodbye to the two of them I will definitely be looking forward to that day the two mother and child waved back goodbye ye woo you must come back soon the system announced the dungeon lost Celestial Temple has been completed a large team is using the scroll to return to the city at Yu's home he had just entered and shouted I'm back everyone in the house immediately looked towards the door y Yuni called out brother y woo Hower Lu Fang and Ruan tyen tyen were also surprised why Woo you're really back Yu's parents were stunned to see him everyone was momentarily taken aback when they saw him return Yan F joyfully rushed towards her brother brother you finally come back I was so worried about you Yu stood firm supporting his little sister silly girl what is your brother have to worry about isn't it safe to come back now luang also happily stood by adding that's right the entire team has returned safely our first dungeon of the king combat team has concluded successfully ruin tanan was equally excited it's really great that no one got hurt furthermore our levels have increased significantly it's a huge gain Kai XI quickly nodded in agreement all thanks to Yu even Nana looked at him with joy oh the master has returned safely it seems my plan has failed currently Lu Fang was at level 68 Ruan T tan at level 63 Nana at level 175 and kayak's level was unclear y Wu helped his mother and said happily I heard that your performance in this dungeon was quite good but remember that safety must always come first Yu's mother looked at him tears Welling in her eyes it's good that you are back it's good that you are back ywu scratched his head awkwardly looking at his parents I'm I know Mom and Dad is there anything to eat as soon as I got home I suddenly feel really hungry mother y woo said happily it's all done just waiting for you everyone come here to eat Lu Fang quickly ran ahead delighted great finally I can eat it feels like he could eat 8 to 10 bowls of rice ruin TNN hearing Lu Fang hurriedly chased after ah Lu Fang don't eat all the delicious food Yu looked around seriously thinking it has been a long time since I have seen such a happy day to protect this happiness I must become stronger even if I have to sacrifice everything I must get the dungeon key back at the pool the little girls were playing with each other everyone was laughing and having a good time Yi woo and L Fang sat on the edge Yi wo comfortably placed his hands behind his head thinking my sister and Nana are really Lively clearly just having gone through a big battle in contrast to Yu luu Fang finished eating and fell asleep lying flat on a large chair snoring loudly enough to drool suddenly the system announced received a communication request from moai yiwu quickly opened the screen and said happily good evening Miss Mo Moi on the other side was lounging on large chair holding a glass of red wine leisurely said good evening I heard that you have returned she continued but I think we need to set aside some time to gather with family which is why I didn't contact you immediately have you had dinner yet yiu quickly replied I just finished eating you think very thoroughly regarding the project blueprints before thanks to you using them in the dungeon they have proved to be very effective Moi NY smiled happily haha no need to be polite helping you is also helping myself if you need anything in the future just let me know Yu not being polite looked at her and said in indeed I have a request now you must already know that the dungeon key was finally taken by G Wang Chuan so does that key ultimately belong to mokai or the group do you have the ability to retrieve it Moki n took a sip of wine and calmly replied this key ultimately belongs to the group so what is it very important to you it's because of money but based on what I know the most valuable resources in this dungeon were destroyed in the battle it probably doesn't hold much economic value you anymore Yu continued I need the key for other reasons therefore I would like to ask you to help with this matter Moi me seeing ye wo Sirus decisively said understood the last opportunity to get the dungeon key is tomorrow because tomorrow the headquarters of the group will hold a shareholder meeting at that time all Associates and Senior leaders including myself and Moi will attend and you were also required to participate if you can persuade my father and Associates at the meeting then there will be a chance to retrieve the dungeon key tomorrow morning I will send a private jet to pick you up tonight you must think of a way to cope Yi Wu quickly responded I understand see you tomorrow then after ending the call yumu thought I never expected that I would have the opportunity to interact with the true central figure of hanm Mo group so soon this must all be thanks to moai otherwise How could a small person like me have the right to attend the shareholder meeting I can't keep relying on her forever the shareholder meeting tomorrow is sure to be very intense I must think of a way to win therefore I have a bold idea the next day at the first secure Zone headquarters of hanmo group inside the large conference room Yi Wu glanced around at everyone who had taken their seats seriously waiting so this is the senior leadership of hanmo group just looking at them I can already recognize the factional distribution Moen long the president president of hanm Mo group at level 110 sat majestically in the middle chair of the room he spoke this time in the dungeon our hanm Mo group has achieved great success not only did we obtain the dungeon key but more importantly we have significantly weakened the morale of the Huang Jen group here on behalf of the board of directors I express my deep gratitude to all the employees who participated in this battle the company will not let down the efforts of everyone next M will announce the rewards for the combat teams that contributed greatly in this battle Moi quickly stood up holding the paper that his secretary had just presented he spoke clearly yes Mr chairman next I would like to announce that the black attack combat team is awarded 100 million the king combat team is awarded suddenly he stared at the paper his face changing color and shouted 20000 million wait a minute chairman this must be a mistake how can an unknown team have reward higher than the black attack combat team Mo zun long did not look at him only frowned and replied this is based on the mission report and value contribution submitted by gwan Chuan and Li ji and then accounted through the system are you doubting the system hearing that Moi quickly said I don't mean that he turned to GW Chuan his voice small but filled with anger what is going on here G Wang Chuan G Wang Chuan sat next to him arms crossed eyes closed not saying a word ywu then stood up cheerfully saying thank you for the affirmation from the chairman and the group regarding our King combat team I have a small request may I use the 200 million prize to exchange for the dungeon key compared to money I want it even more everyone in the room immediately buzz what this guy has already gained benefits but is still showing off how dare he make such an unreasonable request moii sitting beside him remained Silent not saying anything Moi standing opposite pointed at yuu frowning and saying kid don't be ungrateful even if you have some merits this is not a place for an unknown like you to speak and make demands K you need to manage your subordinate more strictly otherwise it will be you who suffers the loss M continued to stay silent just looking at Yu without saying anything Yu then replied ladies and Gentlemen please let me finish speaking if my contributions in the dungeon are not enough for me to set conditions then what if I could completely destroy Wong Jen group would that Merit be enough to make demands everyone was stunned when they heard you w set such a condition what are you talking about the people on moi's side were so angry that they stood up and scolded damn it who do you think you are do you have a say here claiming to have obtained Wang xen truly Shameless bragging there shouldn't be limits to nonsense that person continued to criticize it's your first time attending the shareholders meeting and you dare to talk nonsense in front of the chairman Miss how do you supervise your subordinates L Chang Fang stood at the back the chairman glanced at him frowned and said vwoo this is a shareholders meeting speak appropriately if you have any opinions discuss them after the meeting Mo zun long turned to look at Lu chain Fang and slowly said don't be Hasty y Wu might have something calculated luang Fang leaned down and whispered in his ear I'm afraid he might cause a big mess this time is originally a good opportunity for our overall performance to surpass the black attack combat team weakening moki's power but this brat suddenly disrupted it Mo zun long responded calmly don't jump to conclusions too quickly about anything especially concerning Yu let's hear his opinions first ji Wang Chuan had been silent until now continuing to stare at Yu pondering in his mind he thought to himself in the past he did indeed show interest in having the dungeon key but I didn't expect him to desire it to this extent G wangchu and spoke up calmly but he didn't lose his mind just because of this if he had he would have already taken action to defeat me and snatch the key therefore what you Wu just said is certainly not said casually without thought based on past experience the more unbelievable what he says is the more it proves he is not joking Moi smiled stood up and clapped his hands to ask everyone to maintain order please be quiet I want to say a few words to Young Brother ywu your contribution in this key battle is indeed considerable even G Wang Chuan has highly praised you which shows your capabilities are not bad after pausing for a moment Moi unexpectedly pointed directly at Yu's face his eyes sharp he spoke with a tone filled with malice but after all you are just a kid who doesn't understand the world you dare to make groundless statements here which is truly embarrassing M exuded a strong Aura of anger he continued to scold y Wu loudly the emity between Wang Jang and hanm mo has existed for a long time it involves Finance military and many other aspects the relationships within it are extremely complicated two large corporations have been competing for more than a decade without achieving a clear outcome and you are just a newcomer unaware of the vastness of the world blindly daring to claim you want to take over Guang Jen group you are truly a person of great courage but little wisdom blinded by profit if merely speaking could defeat Wang Jang then how could it possibly fall to you it's truly ridiculous taking a deep breath he regained his composure crossed his arms and looked up at M with a challenging expression sister I don't know how your acqu acquainted with this kid but as your brother I have to remind you that when choosing people you need to keep your eyes wide open otherwise you will be dragged down by Petty people and will suffer for nothing moai still kept her eyes closed sitting with her arms crossed not bothering to respond everyone who stood by Moi at that moment joined in criticizing y wo young Master MO is right though it's hard to accept what he said is the truth a person who doesn't know the heights of Heaven and the depths of the earth like this kid deserves to be taught a lesson y Wu is truly too thick skinned the Rune was buzzing with discussion and Y Wu glanced at M's darkening expression silently thinking no wonder he is the young master of Han Mok gr his eloquence is evident every word hits the mark and stir the spirit of the opposing faction next the key factor determining the situation no longer lies with me but with Moi n sure enough m n stood up and replied loudly I'm sorry brother but I cannot entirely agree with your statement just now y Wu was startled it's M's attitude Moi frowned as he looked at his younger sister his voice tense what do you mean m n stood up and calmly said indeed as you said the conflict between us and Wang Jang has existed for a long time normally it's true that it cannot be resolved in a day but ywu is not someone who can be judged by conon reasoning since I met him every time I think something is impossible he always surprises and delights me she continued in zone 9 he rescued an entire school and fored the ancient Lord's Advent Society scheme to kill a different world boss AEL during the peace meeting in zone 8 you once again prevented a terrifying attack from the ancient Lord's Advent Society saving tens of thousands of lives and in this major team operation he played the most crucial role without him the outcome could still will be an unknown m n concluded if this is the fool that you speak of then I believe his bravery will create a miracle for us each illustrative word that M nag recounted in just a few concise sentences made everyone reconsider their views yeu listen to her recount her achievements scratching his head and blushing awkwardly saying although it's all true but you are praising me in front of so many people is that really appropriate haha the people in the room continued to chatter some nodded in agreement Miss has a point but isn't this a bit exaggerated another person interjected what are you scared I'm not even afraid of the boss why should I be afraid of being defeated it's just mokai saw that people were starting to have their thoughts swayed by M's words he glared at her with anger his tone sarcastic you really know how to talk don't you m N9 did not bother to look at him and simply smirked in reply it's the same anyway Mo zun long who had been silent until now suddenly spoke up he looked at both of them his voice deep but firm mokai and Kai both have their own reasoning however regarding the grudge between hangmat and Wang Jang we must be careful and consult him he turned his head looking straight at y Wu his gaze serious and dominating vwoo it is still not too late for you to retract your previous statement out of respect for your past contributions I will not hold it against you but if you remain Resolute all the consequences that follow will be borne by you success and rewards will not come simply and it will not just stop at a dungeon key he continued but if you fail not only will you be treated like a discarded person but you will also endanger the lives of your family and Kai if that happens won't you change your mind y wo and mo Kai replied in unison we won't change Moen long stood up and turned to leave before stepping out of the conference room he said I hope you can do what you say meeting dismissed Yi Wu loudly declared 10 days within 10 days I will definitely win hang Jang just wait for my good news on that day Mo zun long shot a sharp glance at Yu and coldly responded I Will Wait the meeting concluded Moi walked over to yiu Smiling as he said you extended the time for yourself like this locking your path back if you're not a mad man then you must surely be an incredibly willful person with a deep-seated heart I'm even more interested in you now after 10 days will you become the cannon fodder that disappears from this world or the hero who returns here ywu shoved his hands into his pockets and smiled slightly ha thanks for your concern mokai left and the people from m n rushed over all surrounding ywu with worried Expressions Lu Chang Fang anxiously said Li woo you caused a big trouble why is Miss also following you madly like this the chubby man said worriedly did you not hear what the chairman said I appreciate Yu's bravery it wasn't easy for him to join M's faction and yet you just arrived and want to kill me the man standy behind also spoke up if you have decided that you must have a countermeasure in mind right Yu wikked at everyone and happily replied actually I haven't thought of any countermeasures yet but in my heart there's a voice telling me that I must kill Huang Jen The Bodyguard of Miss Mo was the first to shout ha he struggled to hold himself up groaning I'm definitely going to die the chubby man was so angry that he wanted to jump up and Hig him you fool you are ruining my glory and wealth I will fight you to the death Lu Chang Fang quickly stopped him saying stop even though I want to kill him too but he dares to confront even Tulu directly nobody here is a match for him the shubby man shouted angrily then who am I supposed to reason with better to die than live like this at this moment m n stood with her hands on her hips frowning at y woo saying all right all right don't tease them anymore I know your temperament All Too Well quickly tell me what bad intentions do you have this time Yu looked at her and quickly smiled ingratiatingly haha you really understand me not joking anymore yiu seriously looked at everyone and said although I truly do not have a specific plan my purpose and goals are quite clear firstly I have a personal grudge against Wang Jang this time through the dungeon this grievance has only deepened from my perspective I must destroy him uproot him completely the spring breeze blows and life begins a new secondly the strongest combat power of Wong Jang is suu I have fought against her before if I strike quickly I absolutely am not weaker than her furthermore more through this battle Wong Jen's combat strength has been severely harmed this is a good opportunity to act y continued thirdly even though I do not care about your internal power struggles M you have helped me a lot this is a favorable moment to repay your kindness with this great achievement your status will surpass Moi and become the true voice of hanm Mo upon hearing this liai looked at him and asked in a deep voice although the situation is forced is it also reasonable the most important thing is are you confident in your ability to do this Lu chain Fang also replied indeed with your strength you might really be able to achieve it the chubby man looked at him with a different expression this decisiveness and bravery are truly astonishing mokai spoke up this is indeed a bold and difficult choice I will not force any of you to follow me if you wish to withdraw you can leave now I guarantee there will be no repercussion as soon as M finished speaking almost everyone quickly ran away one person mumbled I won't accompany this madman I haven't lived enough yet another person agreed that's right at most we'll choose the other side and start over better than dying only two people remained the chubby man sweating profusely from fear but still decided I will risk everything putting this armor on this freakish brat if I win I'll become even richer if I lose then it's my life Lu Chang Fang didn't speak but in his heart he had decided Miss rest assured no matter what I will not betray you even if there are mountains of blades and seas of fire ahead looking at the master seeing that he was still standing there moai was surprised and said master lii I didn't expect you to stay as well I've always thought you were neutral liai looked at her and calmly said I have no interest in the power struggle between between you and moai I am here only for y wo this is a debt I owe him no matter what he decides I will do everything to support him mokai looked at him and nodded in agreement at least on this point we share the same view yiu seeing their trust in him clasped his hands in thanks his eyes showed determination as he seriously said thank you for your support and Trust I will absolutely not let you down now please leave everything to me in area number eight he woo was mingling in the bustling crowd walking and thinking he told himself I have always been passively subject to Wong Jen's Pursuit but if I want to take proactive action my understanding of him is still too little fortunately I have made prior arrangements if I want to understand his internal situation I need to start with Mr lie the one who always wants to become a Master Level pharmacist suddenly Yu's eyes brightened he looked across and smiled slightly ah it really is a case of saying and encountering Yu turned into an alley the group of followers behind began to panic the target is about to run away quit chase after him however as soon as they entered the path he took they immediately stopped astonished and exclaiming a dead end where did that guy go they said just now everyone clearly saw him suddenly the entire group was struck by a punch to the face leaving everyone terrified thinking an ambush we clearly wore Optical camouflage how could we still be detected Captain M Wong of the assassination team hang Jang level 85 spoke up although the previous attack was silent and without form through the direction of the Fall I was able to pinpoint your location immediately he released a new type of grenade this was a fogging grenade which created a large amount of smoke effective for hiding in the foggy area helping to avoid attacks from outside the area a loud explosion sounded even though y Wu had concealed himself he still did not Escape mang's precise judgment When the Smoke dissipated mang quickly threw three throwing knives and shouted it's that position die Yi Wu immediately threw a punch at mang and said you do have some skill if that's the case I won't hide anymore heiu the stealth State and caught the three throwing knives thrown by mahong looking at mang injured and falling to the ground ye smiled and said oh I remember you aren't you the captain of the assassination team hang Jang in the previous battle in the boss different ATA World wanting to Ambush Yin hon and the others Mah Wang lay on the ground looking at yiwu and said so you notice me but the dead do not need to remember the face of the Assassin he quickly manifested his gaze cold I originally intended to follow you back to your residence and start with your family but since I've been discovered I can only changed my plans as soon as he finished he drew a sword and charged straight at Yu with the intent to kill I am no longer the same as before even Yan Juan is no match for me you can only die yiu did not turn his back and simply replied is that so immediately a dragon arm appeared tightly gripping Mah Wang's neck he was astonished struggling desperately ERG I can't believe you can keep up with the speed I always prided myself on the dragon hand tightened further causing mang's whole body to tremble growing weaker he can only produce fragmented sounds oh oh er urg er Yu looked down coldly his voice laced with killing intent anyone who dares to touch my family usually dies a terrible death but today I can make an exception just tell me who is behind your command and I will help you die comfortably Mal Wong laughed wickedly his eyes full of provocation he suddenly bit down on a hidden pill in his mouth to conceal the truth I never thought that despite my frenzy cultivation I can't even scratch a hair of yours but don't dream of getting any secrets from me haha ye woo shouted loudly if you want to bite the poison and commit suicide how can it be that easy he quickly used his mental control skill intracranial resonance this skill lasts for 60 seconds a note fell out from the boss of the insect species avoiding you under the ground of the academy ye woo angrily asked tell me who is the one behind this mawang was horrified and widened his eyes barely able to utter the immediately his entire Consciousness was controlled mwang bowed his head and spoke in a mechanical voice Master it is Lord Ling Yuan a colleague of the Huang Jen group Yi Wu's body surged with killing intent muttering Ling Yuan isn't she the female commander of Wang Jang in the dungeon last time I didn't expect this woman to be so malicious daring to Target my family well I have already prepared to act then let's kill her first Malong knelt down and continued may I ask Master what else can I do to assist you y Wu turned his head and walked away not bothering to look at him saying not only did you follow me but you also wanted to assassinate my family what do you think you should do Mal Wong trembled and replied I understand now then I will take my own life to atone for my sins with that he drew a gun and shot himself in the head ye wo watched this scene feeling cold all over he thought to himself I will never easily forgive anyone who dares to harm my family the system announced the player receives a reward including 100,000 experience points and 500,000 bonus coins the optical camouflage cloak when equipped will conceal the user's body and energy increase movement speed by 50% and its Effectiveness will double when used at night in Elder L's laboratory Elder Li stood before y wo and respectfully said V Master you have arrived previously your outstanding performance in the Lost Celestial Temple dungeon has spread throughout the Huang Jen group the entire group can now be said to Hate You To The Bone especially those in Ling Yuan after being severely punished by the group they even spread rumors that a high reward is offered to anyone who can bring you down Yu cly looked at him and replied this is precisely why I want to destroy Guang Jang and Ling Yuan Elder Li looked at Yu with concern and said but the higher ups of Wong Jang are not easy to topple however if you have made that decision then you must have a comprehensive plan this is not something I can intervene in I only hope that after you destroy Wang Jang I ye woo interrupted him and sat down in a chair you can rest assured I will not leave you with nowhere to go after the complete overthrow I will let you join the handm group after all research is the same no matter where you do it it only differs in whom you work for Yu continued moreover I believe that the hanmo group will not give up on a senior Alchemist who is about to become a Master Level pharmacist Elder Li hearing this widened his eyes and said joyfully thank you master in fact as long as you don't discard a palm like me I would be very grateful because my goal is simply to follow you and become a Master Level pharmacist Yu looked at him and continued all right let's get to the main issue what is the current situation within the Huang Jen group Elder Li honestly replied I won't hide it from you although it's not visible from the outside the Hang Jen group is actually facing a risk of internal division therefore choosing this time to act can be considered the best opportunity the H Jen group is divided into three major factions the first is the Yuan faction which mainly employs assassination cunning schemes and sabotage this faction is the weakest and specializes in carrying out disgraceful tactics on behalf of the group the second is the Hang fuang faction which is responsible for managing the financial Network and the economic Lifeline he is currently the president of Wong Jen he continued speaking all the legitimate business operations are managed by him with top-notch capabilities thirdly juang Fu's faction mainly SKS in arms trading in Mercenaries although their strength is not on par with juang fuen they have managed to attract many external forces so they cannot be underestimated by the way although hang Fu and Wang Fu Shen are brothers they do not like each other in the past they have long severed ties these three forces are always in Fierce conflict each side wanting to take over the other to monopolize power L yuan's faction is trying to survive in the gaps between these two major forces this time when they obtained the command of the dungeon they wanted to take the opportunity to turn the tables however due to the involvement of the master they ended up suffering a complete defeat which is why they wanted to take action to kill him yiu felt increasingly intrigued so that's how it is truly a stroke of luck for me such a large Rift if it isn't exploited that would be a Pity as long as I can manipulate the relations between the three families to se Discord within hang Fu faction I will easily gain substantial benefits finishing his words he stood up and said this matter cannot be delayed send me the address of lenan I will go meet this woman Elder lie was startled and said in amazement Master are you really planning to go find her yourself to settle the score but her place is protected by a large number of elite assassins you are on your own and you might be in danger ye Wu enthusiastically replied the more dangerous a woman is the more interesting she becomes if I could approach her will it would be unbearably dull Elder lie laughed and exclaimed you truly live up to your reputation in the upper level private Villa L Yuan was relaxing in a large bathtub holding a glass of wine her gaze directed out towards the city she curled her lips thinking about the directors she looked down upon those foolish men just because of one failure they blamed me for 2 hours straight it's all at Yu's fault if it weren't for him constantly meddling I would have already wiped out hanmo and obtained the dungeon mentioning y woo she tightened her grip her anger flaring up woo I will definitely find you furthermore I W kill you easily I want you to watch your family die one by one in front of you I will torment you to the point where you wish you were dead and in the end I will make you kneel lick my feet and beg me to kill you ha Ling you on with startled when she heard the sound e coing is that so Yu stood in front of her a faint smile on his face I don't have a footlicking hobby Ling Yuan was frightened and exclaimed you're ye woo Ling Yuan quickly stood up trying to maintain her composure she asked her voice tinged with worry lwo why are you here Yu looked at her A smirk on his lips if I want to come I come the look in Ling yuan's eyes briefly showed surprise but she quickly composed herself she forced a smile and said it is indeed a bit surp surprising but still within the range I can control it seems the people I sent to watch you have been discovered on the contrary you even followed them here otherwise you wouldn't know my secret address Yi Wu curled his lips in a cold smile turning his face away as if to distance himself he replied his tone filled with disdain follow them it's not that complicated to be straightforward I'm too lazy to chat with a corpse wanting to find someone is very simple for me hearing those words Ling Yuan couldn't help but feel a surge of panic she thought to herself the people I sent to tail him are all dead a useless bunch I specifically instructed them to take action from his family this person is more dangerous than I imagined and I can only use cunning to deal with him thinking that Ling Yuan stepped out of the bathtub exuding seduction she looked at y wooed scoff haha ever since the last time the boss hastily unlocked the previous version you haven't forgotten me you and yet you come looking for me here she made a gesture of flipping her hair eyes shy and continued following you was all an order from the leader I was just following orders I hope you don't take it to heart after finishing her words Ling Yuan gently hugged y woo her voice shy I'm really interested in you young handsome powerful and mysterious with your abilities how about we cooperate secretly let's put Wong Jang and handm on pocket together as she spoke she suddenly pulled out a knife gently putting it behind guo's neck nevertheless her face still retained a shy expression as she asked what do you think in her mind lingu one thought the fragrance of my body has a mesmerizing and controlling effect no man can withstand being this close go to hell but when she intended to stab you woo she unexpectedly discovered huh what's going on why can't my body move you wo placed his hand on her waist smiling it seems that although your heart isn't sincere your body is quite honest because they would never dared act against their Master Ling Yuan was terrified hurriedly pulling y Wu away her lips trembling stop talking nonsense what are you doing to me her heart was filled with anxiety my mind is still very clear my limbs are fine but for some reason I can't take action my body seems to be automatically resisting any attempt to attack him y Wu cheerfully picked up a vial of drops saying gently while you were soaking in the tub I added a specially crafted desperate poison into your bathwater it seems the effects have already begun to take hold the system notification spider heart poison this toxin is crafted using ancient methods colorless odorless with the ability to slowly diffuse extending its duration of action The Poisoned individual can maintain their Clarity but cannot resist any commands from the one who poison them Len Yu unheld a knife frowning as she looked at y Wu saying a control toxin impossible you're lying to me I have never heard of such a poison Yu snapped his fingers not even bothering to look at her only calmly replying is it true or false why not try a little and see Ling Yuan was horrified to realize she couldn't control her own actions the knife in her hand was slowly being raised and aimed right at herself she screamed she was so terrified ifed that she was sweating when she saw the knife slowly approach her throat Yu bought the knife but his face showed murderous intent as he coldly said you can touch me but if you dare to touch my family the only outcome is death Ling Yan quickly nodded her voice trembling I'm sorry I was wrong I shouldn't have such malicious thoughts truly I was wrong you woo held the knife his cold gaze fixed on her but he realized dealing with you directly would be a waste after all Bringing Down the entire Wang Jen group is my goal hand over the space system access device and also the high level permissions of Wang Jen Lang Yuan panicked her voice stammering how do you know about the group space network no if I do that I will die she trembled and took out a small device handing it to Yu this is my personal access device please take it the account and password are she paused her eyes filled with Terror no my body has her body Shook and she had to lean against the cabinet to remain standing she spoke almost pleading everything you want I have already given can you let me go this time yiu ignored her words focusing on the device he had just received after a moment he coldly said it's not your turn yet you can sleep now he had just finished speaking when Ling Yuan immediately lay down in the middle of the room and fell asleep the surroundings began to change ye who stood stood in the room and thought to himself no wonder this is the dedicated access device of the board of directors the speed is incredible I didn't expect to return so quickly this time I will definitely wipe out his Network system and see what Secrets he is hiding there were two cameras at the door capturing the scene and the system reported scanning and verifying welcome back Deputy L Yuan Yu stepped into the room his gaze fixed on the large screen in front of him finally accessed This Is the deputy's personal room he sure knows how to enjoy himself this life is a far cried from that of ordinary people no one feels like they are living a civilian life yiu quickly ordered there is no time to waste I Vis immediately sprang into action the robot swiftly taking orders Yes master yiu settled comfortably into the large chair his gaze still glued to the screen as he listened to IIs report the research documents in this room all relate to the sphere of influence of that woman for example Capital distribution assassination team distribution and information on Espionage members these do not hold much significance after hearing this yiu pondered for a moment and then spoke so can we lever the guest capabilities of the master technician to borrow the authority to probe into the information of the two other factions a vis quickly replied with Ling yuan's high level Authority it takes only a few minutes to retain and process this information the working capital of the entire group weapon strategies personal collaborations and user data have been fully collected this time the Hang Jing group seems to be running naked in front of us haha a moment later a series of data appeared on the screen I Vis began to analyze and said based on the collected documents I will provide you with some action suggestions based on my calculations first attack through the economic aspect we can exploit hacking techniques to publicly disclose internal confidential documents causing disadvantages for hang Jang this will lead to their stock prices plummeting Second Use violent methods based on intelligence recording the locations of Wong Jen's weapon storage bases we can carry out covered operations to systematically dismantle and cut off their supply resources ywu rested his arms on the chair showing satisfaction and said not bad not bad continue I Vis continued the analysis next you can leverage Ling yuan's authority to command an assassination Squad targeting specific individuals these targets could include spies that Guang Jang has placed in other groups additionally we can assassinate minor figures within the opposing group to create chaos and disputes among the competing factions the system continued finally it is to completely destroy the survival Network that the Hang Jen group relies on making them blind and deaf yiu saw the Ferocious expression of IIs and felt a little frightened but still smiled and said kid you finally have a bit of the demeanor of a villain's adviser but I like it he stood up and ordered let it be done like this everything must be completed within 10 days not only for the BET with M Kei to obtain the dungeon key but also because I don't want to be teleported away at a critical moment and have no time to react let's go suddenly I viz exclaimed in panic wait a moment master I just intercepted a highly confidential news I will send it to you right away yuu looked at the information on the screen and exclaimed in astonishment Wang Jang is secretly contacing various major and minor forces inside and outside the safe Zone preparing to gather to attack hanm MO is he trying to annihilate each other he pondered I didn't expect hang Jang to take action first to gain an advantage fortunately I discovered this otherwise I would definitely be caught off guard he plans to launch a fullscale attack in 5 days with only 5 days left it seems I have to use this time to create a major surprise for him in the night at the center a voice sounded is it y woo why are you calling me so late y woo on the other end te's guess where I am right now M was sitting on the bed in her bedroom while checking the system screen she replied based on your style you must be out causing trouble for hang Jen on Yu's side after taking down a guard on the rooftop he casually stood and talked to her he reported I am currently at the house of Ling Yuan Wong jang's Deputy to settle a personal score by the way I just got some important news upon hearing that Moi immediately asked Ling youan if I remember correctly she is one of the three powers of Wong Jen right you really should call it Reckless or overly decisive so what is this important news you replied don't be too shocked when I tell you this it is exactly as I expected mokii astonished exclaimed loudly what are you saying Juan Jang is amassing forces and is preparing to launch a full-scale attack on us in 5 days is this news for real Yi Wu calmly responded this is top secret information that I intercepted by directly hacking into hang jang's system it can't be fake hearing his firm assertion mokai fell silent she raised her hand to her chin analyzing Wang Jang seems to be in right although their strength has weakened only half of our hand Mo if they Ally with other forces and launch a surprise attack disregarding the consequences it would still create a devastating blow against us listening to her analysis he said quickly inform your father and Moy about this news but don't let anyone else know I suspect there's a mole in the hand Mo Corporation upon hearing this she calmly stood up and said this is very normal harano has also arranged spies in other companies but but upon saying this she suddenly paused y Wu on the other side then asked are you still worried about something Moi I walked toward the window looking out at the night sky and said I'm worried that even if I tell my father and mo key they might not necessarily believe me because we just said we want to defeat Wang Jang but then mentioned that Guang Jang wants to attack us such contradictory attitudes would only make them suspect that we are up to something wanting to use the company's power to eliminate Guang Jen he sat on the roof Terrace listening to her reasoning and could only say people like them live all year round in the whirlpool of intrigue he said anyone who doubts will certainly not believe in such clear contradictions although I do not intend to borrow their strength I must inform them at least to make them Vigilant compared to that I am more worried about another matter hearing this she asked what matter he said seriously how much damage will the war between the two major factions caused to ordinary people the disaster in zone 9 before will happen again especially my family is currently in zone 8 I must consider their safety Kate me crossed her arms fell into contemplation and then said although this is not the outcome I hoped for the conflict between the two sides fighting heedlessly will certainly affect the civilians she looked down at where she lived the knights here are truly beautiful the people are still moving about in a peaceful atmosphere she continued this place is my my hometown I do not wish for it to be devastated by War but the current situation is like a boow string ready to snap if we remind the people to evacuate in advance hang Jang will detect the clues and miss the opportunity she paused for a moment and then continued furthermore even if I mobilize all forces I cannot guarantee the safety of the civilians after all there are nine safe zones here and the actual population is just too large she hesitated her voice gradually becoming smaller therefore she paused for a moment and said I can only rely on you ye woo you must work hard to weaken Wang jang's strength and reduce the scale of the battle to a controllable level before the official conflict begins hearing her say that he agreed and replied I was just thinking the same thing here is the intelligence I have obtained about Guang Jang and a plan I have developed please take a look so we can quickly come up with the final efficient solution he said her the plans he had devised looking at his plan on the screen she could not Hive her surprise in such a short time you thought of so much truly impressive after reviewing she nodded and said I see no issues with this plan you should proceed as you see fit if you need support you can always contact me she continued to offer advice regarding your family I recommend they leave the company during this time being near the company will be very dangerous at the moment do you have any reliable friends who could take care care of your family during this time upon hearing this he thought for a moment and softly murmured a reliable friend ha then he said thank you for the reminder I've come up with a solution let's proceed like this for now good night she replied she replied okay sleep well somewhere a car was rolling down a grally path outside the safe Zone on a cold day the vehicle sped along kicking up a thick layer of dust inside the car U spoke up everyone get out of the car they are about to arrive these are your family members I brought them out of the safe Zone to avoid being affected by the upcoming battle his mother anxiously asked little ye are you really not going with us his father intended to intervene but quickly advise once the two major factions go to war there will be almost no safe place in the city why don't you come with us at this point he suddenly stopped Yu understood that his father and mother were worried about him so he turned back and put on his brightest smile to reassure them I'm sorry father mother this time I can't listen to you after all in a sense I am the main character of this battle the show hasn't even started yet how can the main character leave the stage early don't worry I will be fine seeing their son assertively confirm his father and mother knew they couldn't force him so they could only helplessly say all right seeing you so calm we can also feel at ease after all you have grown up far beyond our understanding but remember no matter how strong you are caution is always the priority don't let your guard down yiu nodded I understand after comforting father and mother yiu turned back to the others and said yanf Kai XI Nana I'm sorry for troubling you all kxi stepped forward her gaze Resolute Leo I want to stay and help you Yun feay couldn't hold back either hesitating for a moment before saying brother I'm very conflicted although I know the right thing to do now is to be with father and mother I can't control the desire to stay and help you youu looked at Yun Fe gently ruffling her hair to comfort her I know you are worried but this time it's not something you all can handle this battle is far different from a dungeon facing human opponents is much more complex than dealing with magical beasts human nature is something that cannot be controlled and it is also the most dangerous hearing him Young fake calm down I understand now at this moment Nana sincerely reminded him Master you must be careful this opponent is a large organization after all they have the advantage in numbers Yi Wu smiled reassuringly there's no need to worry I have experience dealing with Wong Jang this time we are well prepared I believe that very soon everyone will be reunited Nana remember to protect everyone well because besides me your level is the highest hearing this Nana nodded happily yes Nana will definitely do that suddenly she realized she was reacting a bit differently she thought to herself oh was I just worry about him no I just don't hope he dies senselessly in the war like that his life must definitely be in my hands yes it must be like that seeing the people in front of her ye W silently encouraged herself after I get the key to the dungeon I will definitely establish a stronghold that way my family won't have to struggle everywhere because of dangers from the outside anymore just wait for me the sound of vehicles was getting closer and a voice called out from afar vwoo we have arrived have you been waiting long it was the sky Dawn team it turned out y wo had asked them to bring her family to safety l king Yun led a new group of people waved at him and said guys this is the person I told you about quickly say hello upon hearing that they all bowed and said in unison hello yiu seeing them surround him yiu spoke up hey I'm just an investor right why suddenly has it turned into a senior position XA G laughed threw an arm around Yu shoulder and said no need to be surprised our team has reached its current scale thanks to your money and strategic plan in terms of feelings and reasons you deserve to be a senior how Shu chimed in that's right what's up you don't agree Zen Chang stood behind and added don't worry there won't be any trivial matters to trouble you you just need to be a spiritual totem l king Yun then asked do you really not need our help now our Horizon combat team is different from before we have enough manpower to deal with various issues hearing this you replied this time it's not necessary the situation is quite complicated and acting alone is more convenient you all just need to focus on protecting my family seeing that he had said so Lan King Yun responded no problem leave it to us after that he turned back and cheerfully wave goodbye to his family hello father mother I am the captain of The Horizon combat team land King Yun I have been entrusted by Yi Wu to ensure the safety of everyone during this time please guide us there was no time to delay he urged let's get moving we don't want to miss Yu's plan his father happily said all right then we rely on you kids after getting in the vehicle everyone looked out the window waving goodbye to him once more V woo you must take care everyone is waiting for your return He also cheerfully raised his hand high in farewell his face glowing as he shouted everyone take care I promise I'll be back very soon after saying that he turned and headed towards the safe Zone calling out let's go a vis enter Wang jang's Network and begin the first phase of combat operations understood AZ responded at the Huang Jen group in the data monitoring room everyone was still working diligently Wang fuen the chairman of the group spoke up and asked what is the current situation a subordinate quickly reported everything is going smoothly according to the Chairman's plan as long as we continue to push the stock prices up today and complete a round of harvesting the capital to launch the raid can be secured on time this time we will definitely capture the hanmo group hearing this Juan fuang smiled with satisfaction and said very good suddenly the screen displayed a red alert a subordinate turned pale and shouted report the system has just detected a large amount of negative news about the group spreading online this is causing everything to deviate from the trajectory we had mapped out why fuang angrily shouted what at such a critical moment what is the content the subordinate White the sweat from his brow and immediately replied I will transfer it to the main screen right away the screen displayed a series of negative news about the Hang Jen group along with highly engaging posts on social media some prominent headlines included Guang Jen suffered a disastrous defeat against hanmo in the dungeon battle or the culprit who destroyed the base turned out to be it not stopping there information about pong jang's main battle team being severely injured spread rapidly a member of the Emperor team expressed surprise and stated that he did not understand what had happened Additionally the beautiful CEO of Wang Jen who was responsible for overseeing the operations was heavily criticized for the failure the board of directors demanded that she take action to redeem herself the atmosphere in the monitoring room became extremely tense after reading a series of unfavorable news a man angrily shouted what the hell is this damn it what is all this nonsense he then turned around and pointed did at several subordinates yelling Dan it how are you doing business didn't we spend $188,000 to bribe all the companies in media why is there negative news related to us the bald subordinate after contacting various companies in media replied I've asked several places but they all say they don't know about this it seems like the system has been hacked contrary to the Panic of the subordinates Sherman Huang Jen remained calmer he said this kind of fabricated rumor isn't frightening quickly handle it thoroughly and investigate the source of the information see who dares to confront us just as he finished speaking another subordinate rushed in shouting not good a report about the internal Financial losses of the group is just spread online all the figures have been verified as true Guang Jang could no longer maintain his composure he shouted what did you say then he rushed over grabbed the collar of the person who had reported and said in a low voice how could this happen how could the confidential financial report documents of the internal group Bleak online are you sure you're not mistaken he leaned back in fear and replied absolutely correct chairman I have crosschecked multiple times this is indeed the data from our internal financial report a series of bad news emerged one after another the subordinates hurriedly reported chairman due to the disclosure of the financial report just now the company's stock price has started to decline two Leathers anxiously added the subsidiaries are the same in fact the stock prices of our partner Enterprises are also plummeting one person continued to report the market capitalization has been estimated to evaporate by hundreds of billions chairman please give instructions looking at the figures and the stock prices plummeting without breaks he furiously shouted trembling what is this situation who is sabotaging me Suddenly at T sound indicated someone was contacting him the system quickly reported wi fui is requesting to contact you in his heart he thought of all times he chooses to call now then he pressed the button to accept the call on the other end Juan Fay spoke hello Big Brother the stock price of the company just plummeted what is going on hearing the question you can only respond helplessly I am not sure I don't know where the confidential information was leaked from on the the other side at the Hang Jen group in a secret War Room a man was standing in front of the communication screen that person is Guang Fu after hearing Guang Jang speak in a disjointed manner he angrily shouted what do you mean you're unclear the leaked documents are the confidential reports of the company and you have always been responsible for safeguarding them now you say you're unclear this affects our plans can you bear the responsibility for this faced with the shouting the old man wouldn't back down and shouted back loudly damn it what kind of attitude is that is this how you speak to your elder brother I will investigate this matter myself you should focus on managing your Armed Force as well ju fug hearing this retorted angrily I don't need you to concern yourself with my matters the progress on my side is going very smoothly just as he hung up a subordinate rushed in in a panic to report it's not good senior our Armory is under attack the main screen displayed images of the Armory being destroyed a notification popped up alert the second Armory is under attack by unidentified forces with damage levels reaching 80% requesting reinforcements requesting reinforcements other areas also reported that the third fourth and fifth zones were also under attack looking at the military zones being destroyed on the screen he seemed unable to believe it hin Fu's face darkened as he listened to his subordinates report he spoke sternly impossible absolutely impossible the locations of the weapons cache are all classified I selected them carefully and only a few people within the company even know how could it be attacked on such a large scale could there be an Insider before he finished speaking Juan fui turned a glare at one of his subordinates he grabbed the man's collar lifted him off the ground and growled is it you the subordinate turned pale with fear and quickly exclaimed senior spare me how how could it possibly be me at that moment he added senior the surveillance footage at the scene has captured the image of the Intruder hin Fu released the subordinate tossed him aside and ordered send it to the main screen immediately I need to see who dares to touch my property on the screen a large Shadow appeared amidst the Flames juang Fu's well-armed subordinates continued to unleash a hail of bullets at the Target one of them shouted it's on fire quickly shooting him dead bullets pierced through the body of the figure yet it continued to advance boldly step by step the scene caused chaos Among The Men Who screamed the bullets the bullets are ineffective this is a monster the figure unexpectedly grinned he raised his hand and a surge of energy emitted along with a loud explosion creating a shock wave that affected the entire electrical signal system in the area H fui looked at the screen in front of him the signal suddenly interrupted causing the screen go black one of his subordinates reported the screen only shows this the as salent is completely surrounded by fire we cannot identify their identity sir juin Fu was Furious slamming his hand down on the table playing dirty with me huh who exactly is behind this he frowned muttering damn ruining my plans at such a critical moment who could it be could it be the Huang genen group no if it were them they would have acted long ago there would be no need to wait until now after a moment of thought Juan Fu decided looks like the solo plan needs to be carried out sooner in safe Zone number five a figure gradually appeared y woo after finishing the destruction of the Hang Jen group he smiled slightly and said to himself this account twin Witch is truly too useful especially the Advan space transfer magic which helps me move easily between safe zones y Wu open the map looking at the remaining areas he smirked hang Jang surely didn't expect that I would destroy all of their weapon catches large and small in just one morning not only did I deal a severe economic blow but I also wiped out nearly half of their weapon stop piles if I maintain this efficiency I can accomplish most of the plan in just one day everything is going even more smoothly than expected looking up towards safe Zone one y Wu said quickly handle the remaining areas then it's time to warm up at at Guang jang's headquarters in the tall tower across a dazzling light Shone directly into the sky youu saw that scene and murmured isn't that the first district this beam of light it seems to be a barrier spreading out but this is not an ordinary barrier he was startled and said a barrier what is going on here who activated it I should use magic to teleport over there and investigate what it really is at that moment the system reminded him warning detecting the presence of legendary level barrier ahead high level magic cannot penetrate forcing the use of magic will lead to backlash please consider carefully host hearing the systems warning yiu frowned a legendary level barrier what is this after a moment of thought he said now there are only two possibilities first hanmo actively deployed the barrier to avoid being attacked but if that's the case why hasn't Han Mo informed me moreover the headquarter of hang Jang is also located in the first district using this type of Defense doesn't make sense if so there's only one other possibility left before he could finish his reasoning the system chimed in with a new notification saou is requesting to connect with you seeing the name displayed on the screen yiu was a bit surprised saou as soon as he answered he heard her voice rushing yay woo there's an emergency I'm currently in the black market of the fifth district suddenly The Mercenaries and the people from Wang Jang here are surrounding us Bang Bang the sound of gunfire rang out leaving GE woo and shock the sounds of explosions echoed continuously indicating that the battle was raging fiercely she spoke in A hurried tone it's not just Sector 5 I just received news that the company's assets from sector 2 to Sector 9 are all besieged moreover the young lady and the company leader are unreachable you need to go for reinforcement immediately the defening explosion bang rang out again hearing that he replied understood I'll go right away after hanging up he pondered hang Jang acted so quickly this is a last resort he can no longer sit idly by well it's time to put an end to this Feud at the black market in Sector 5 two people lay slumped at the door with laughter ringing out from the group of mercenaries their Captain a man named halang smugly shouted hanm kiddo come out here if you come out now I'll still leave you a way out otherwise just wait until I break the door down and kill each and every one of you he laughed hardly haha inside some people huddled together in fear one person trembled and said I'm scared saou yelled out aren't you afraid of the hand MoGo counterattacking don't think that just because you have Wong Jen back in you you can do whatever you want Mi ya added firmly even if I die I will never surrender to scum like you a person standing nearby terrified turned around and said sister saou it would be better if we don't provoke those beasts call the Beast he scowled and replied defiantly saou what threat are you posing you stinky [ __ ] let me tell you I don't think hang Jang is worth anything he's just a stupid fool and I wanted to kill you for a long time usually I spare you for hand Mo's sake today you better think about how you will serve me later haha his laughter was filled with lust weaving through each word the others inside were terrified collapsing to the ground covering their faces and crying saying to her sister caou what should we do now I don't want to be humiliated by those beasts saou was also very frightened because ywu still hadn't arrived if they really broke down the door she wasn't sure she could withstand it however she tried to reassure every everyone everyone don't lose hope reinforcements will definitely come what we need to do now is to be patient and wait just as she finished speaking a loud explosion rang out the Beast had truly broken in they charged in like starving Tigers shouting greedily beautiful girl we are here if you don't want to die Surrender Your Weapons obediently a girl in panic raised her gun but saou immediately stopped her she cast a cold look at the enemy and said I I advise you to think carefully after this battle hanmo will definitely punish you the enemy paid no attention to her words responding disdainfully what does the battle between your company have to do with us by the time that happens we will have made a big sum of money and disappeared from this Wilderness haha as he said this he suddenly tore her shirt the surprise left saou unable to react and he seized her tightly his face displayed a crude expression I absolutely won't miss this heavenly opportunity today I will let a proud and arrogant person like you taste what it's like to be forcefully suppressed haha as soon as he finished speaking he pinned her down firmly saou struggled but couldn't escape only able to scream no he showed no mercy growing even more excited as he loudly called brothers let's get to work the surrounding henchmen cheered in response senior Long Live haha however things were not as easy as that before they could do anything Flames from outside suddenly erupted engulfing the entire area the henchmen screamed in agony ah the leader panicked and turned around shouting loudly holy [ __ ] what the hell is going on from the Shadows a mysterious figure approached wherever this person passed fire consumed everything causing the leader to panic even more a panick henchman shouted demon devil when seeing the stranger approaching the mercenary pointed a head and shouted damn it what are you standing there for quickly shoot the high-grade water attribute Enchanted bullets kill that thing that's neither human nor devil for me hearing the command the henchmen quickly opened fire towards the front replying in unison yes however the bullets fired had no effect an invisible shield surrounded The Stranger leaving him completely unharmed the leader of the mercenaries angrily roared damn it I used Enchanted bullets and they didn't do anything what's going on the stranger calmly said knowing how to use opposing attributes to attack weaknesses isn't too bad but before absolute power weak point attributes essentially do not exist at that moment the mysterious figure stepped out revealing his face it was Yi Wu SAU and M yya seeing Yi Wu joyfully exclaimed in unison lwo the leader of the mercenaries upon seeing this sneered not only has my plan been ruined but he is also alone there's a lot of us killing him is as easy as flipping a hand he shouted loudly everyone charge cut him down the henchmen replied in unison yes senior just as they charged Yu merely raised his hand and snapped his fingers instantly Flames erupted beneath the pants of the henchmen they jumped up screaming damn it my pants why are they on fire it's hot too hot seeing the situation the other guys also looked down they discovered that their pants were completely burned and they were in pain as they tried to extinguish the Flames while shouting loudly he my pants are on fire at that moment how Ming screamed quick come help me put out the fire hearing their senior call for help the subordinates seemed to forget that they were also on fire they took turns stomping to extinguish the Flames but was still feudal some began to question why is this fire so strange why can't we put it out how m in excruciating pain from the Flames was also accidentally stomped on in a sensitive area by his subordinates screaming in agony he it hurts it's hot I'm going to die who unable to extinguish the fire by himself how mang knelt down clasped his hands in prayer and pleaded please spare my life I beg you let us go we surrender please forgive us it was all due to the coer of orders we had no choice please have mercy on my family for 10 Generations hearing this the man coldly replied surrendering is not enough it's time for reincarnation immediately the Flames blazed stronger incinerating all of them how M and his subordinates could not resist only able to scream in pain before collapsing at that moment SAU and M Yi ran quickly towards him both of them hugged him tightly shoking back tears ye woo finally you have come to save us we're so glad you arrived in time otherwise Mio yaah choked on her words unable to continue due to overwhelming fear ywu gently replied I'm sorry I arrived too late he turned back and said to everyone we can't stay here for long everyone quickly follow me hearing him say that a few people behind hesitated but the surrounds us on all sides how can we get out he didn't answer just silently parted the flames and led the way go this way when they saw the exit gradually becoming clear everyone exclaimed in amazement oh the fire is parting on its own the girls watched him with admiration in their eyes One of Them Softly exclaimed he's so strong and he's also very handsome it turns out he is the legendary person who broke the contribution record in the dungeon battle another girl approached half jokingly asking saou sister saou is he your boyfriend or is he Mio y upon hearing this saou felt a little shy but affirmed unfortunately no but I think now all of you want to be his girlfriend he is just that kind of person meya also avoided everyone's gaze shilly replying don't say that Y wuo is also my benefactor after that everyone followed him out to an empty Square after walking for a while he suddenly stopped pointed toward the safe Zone number one and asked saou saou young lady you've been up there for a long time have you ever seen this kind of barrier before saou looked in the direction he pointed and replied I've never seen a barrier of this scale before so it turns out that it has prevented me from contacting the young lady I've encountered barriers covering small areas like a street but a barrier covering an entire safe Zone like this can only be achieved with a legendary level barrier device hearing her say that he nodded slightly it seems that Wong Jang is determined to fight to the end furthermore they have changed their plan launching an attack ahead of schedule this is beyond my expectations saou continued the battlefield situation is changing rapidly if Wong Jen has made a move we must also respond immediately I will contact the person in charge in other sake zones everyone needs to coordinate to prevent an attack from Hong Jen after hearing her assigned task he spread his wings without hesitation he was preparing to leave flying while saying all right you take care of this aspect I will find a way to break through the barrier and directly attack kuang jenk headquarters saiu reminded him to maintain such a large barrier the resource consumption must be enormous Zone one cannot handle it alone more than half of the energy must be transferred from other safe zones you can exploit this weakness after being prompted by her Yu said okay I understand after saying that he immediately flew away the other girls waved goodbye simultaneously saying oh are you leaving already so soon saou shouted loudly you must pay attention to safety too yiu turned his head and replied I will be careful take care everyone as he flew away he contemplated the situation in area 1 he was unsure how many forces Wang Jang had gathered there but with the Mong team present the the situation would likely not be easy to control however Wang jang's sudden attack made him feel uneasy he thought Ling yuan's access device hasn't received any news or attack orders this means that one of Wong jang's three major forces has acted independently if Ling Yuan has been controlled by me then the one behind this can only be hang fuang or hang Fu I must quickly clarify this meanwhile yiu kept in contact with everyone through the communication device Lang Yuan stood by the window looking down at the barrier of Area 1 clearly stating the information she knewed him Yes master the space was silent except for the echo of the connection Ling yuong slowly moved toward the window her eyes focused on the enormous barrier covering Area 1 she said if Area 1 is isolated then there's a 50% chance it's due to that old second Wan Fu day I speculate his main base is in area 2 this indicates that he wants to cage boss Wang Fu Shang and Wang Jang to fight each other meanwhile he will stand by and reap the benefits as for how to break the barrier I must admit I really don't know before disconnecting Master Yu only instructed lingan ju Fu day understood you continue to await orders he supported Ling Yuan while angrily scolding his subordinates a bunch of useless trash how much money does the company spend to support you and yet you can't even solve this little poison the subordinates could only lower their heads in apology flustered as they replied we truly apologize Haye Lord the poison in Ling yuan's body is indeed one we have never encountered before to completely detoxify we will need much more time hudi glared his voice cold then why aren't you getting to work yes yes Elder lie an experienced pharmacist shook his head in confusion but in his heart he was secretly pleased I didn't expect there to be such a terrifyingly advanced toxin it seems I haven't followed the wrong person he chuckled softly V woo go ahead and completely destroy Wong Jang I can't wait to follow you with struggle in the world of pharmacology haha y Wu used her true eye to scan the surrounding area has the second district started fighting already luckily I destroyed most of Wong jang's heavy weapons earlier so the scale of the battle doesn't seem too large the system reported that there were no life forms matching Guam Fu's characteristics in the inner city area this left yiu feeling very confused impossible is there really no one since Quang fu is not at the second district base he is likely at his secret base this is definitely going to be Troublesome as the recovery time for the true eye is 2 hours what should I do next to find him a drone flew close and reported to Y wo report mastered during the recent Recon sense we discovered a person you will definitely be very interested in a person I'm interested in yu was surprised who is it ah it's that person the Drone continued Yu curious requested more details she is busy as usual yiu smiled and immediately moved to the second district at the bank under hang jang's control she unexpectedly saw a man who had taken down several guards lying sprawled on the ground he was still searching for something not This Not That what on Earth is it the man mumbled then suddenly looked up oh long time no see what are you looking for this time UI was startled when she heard footsteps from behind she quickly stood up drawing her sword to defend herself to her surprise the person who appeared was Yi wo why is it you Yi Wu paused smiling I was just about to ask you the same why do you always choose to steal during the noon are you really afraid that something bad will happen in the morning or at night subie lowered her sword and turned away do you think you're funny why are you always meddling in my Affairs why are you constantly following me Ah that's an interesting thing for you to say I just happened to see and wanted to remind you a bit the situation is tense right now and you are the top Target on Wang jang's Bounty list to brazenly appear in their territory like this is extremely dangerous hearing Yu's words Sylvie only thought of him as a Busy Body she didn't want him entangle herself further quickly saying I appreciate your reminder but you can leave now Yu saw that she was completely unfazed by her safety and continued to rummage through things he thought to himself indeed she is the ice goddess of the academy always exhibiting a strong demeanor she's no different from susulu he waved goodbye all right then I must hurry to deal with Juan Fu you take care of yourself wait a minute hearing the name y Wu just mentioned zooi couldn't help but feel eager to join you said you want to go kill Wang Fu day so Count Me In she spoke up what do you have a grudge against him too y would asked a bit surprised ignoring his question so he quickly walked ahead we just need to share the same goal as for the reason you don't need to ask too much all right all right Yu replied then suddenly stopped but now there's a tricky problem previously I received Intel saying he was at the main base in zone 2 but in reality he's not here do you have any leads sui pondered for a moment then made a guess Wang fui is cunning and suspicious by Nature typically he won't stay at any base for more than 3 days but I know a few places he often frequents then please lead the way yiu nodded giving her the go-ahead to walk in front he watched her go thinking of himself she seems very familiar with the enemy's habits there must be some hidden story between them but that's not my concern I just need to find Wang Fu seeing Yu lost in thought sui urged letun go don't just stand there wait a moment yiu spoke glancing at the money in her hand don't you care about this money my goal has never been about money chubi replied decisively I only take what I want hearing Chu he say that Yu happily replied that's really a waste if you don't need it then I won't be polite anymore wait for me a minute immediately the system quickly notified that Yu's account had received 2,500,000 in funds soon the two of them arrived at the safe Zone number four in the secret command room of Wang Jang a loud explosion rang out Yu stepped on one of his subordinates coldly asking where is huan Fu the subordinates stuttered I I don't know I really don't know yiu looked around then turned to exi with a dis disappointed expression we are empty-handed again so now there's only one place left seeing ye woo acting so decisively and forcefully Sylvie couldn't help but be surprised he is much stronger than before previously I could sense something but witnessing this overwhelming power with my own eyes has left me profoundly shocked it seems that choosing to accompany him is not a wrong decision she thought but right after that Yu prompted her to lead the way let's go there's only one more significant stronghold left I hope our luck is good enough to find it noticing sui bowing her head in silence seemingly ignoring what he said Yu gently shook her shoulder what's wrong why do I feel your body is shaking exu he trembled her voice hesitant and filled with fear if possible I hope I don't have to go back to that place Yu stepped forward patting her shoulder in Comfort it's okay no matter what personal grievances you have with Wang Fu day you can stay here I'll take care of the rest y woo you jie looked up at him touched thank you for your warmth even though my body is resisting I must face it otherwise I will never be able to move forward Yu noded in agreement hoodi is strong but does she also have a past that cannot be mentioned if you have chosen to face it I will do my best to help you the two of them walked towards safe Zone number eight the underground secret base of hang J gen as they walked y Wu glanced around Zone actually has this place I've been here for so long and never discovered it moreover the defensive forces inside regardless of their numbers or Firepower are much stronger than elsewhere it seems we found the right place sui agreed with Yi Wu because this place has the assets that he values the most assets what assets as soon as he finished speaking he realized that a wave of Elemental mag IC attacks was coming at them he suddenly shouted Ambush immediately y Wu opened the protective cage for both of them and stood safely inside he remarked moreover this wave of attacks is interspersed with much stronger magic effects than before it seems we are getting closer to our Target the mist from the attack dissipated right in front of them the two saw five girls who looked exactly alike blocking their path yiu curiously turned to ask akui what is going on here aside from the color of their eyes and hair they not only resemble Sulu but could be said to look identical sui lowered her head trembling as she saw the image of a man standing in front of her he spoke you have finally returned haven't you the or should I call you the experiment subject Azure X II y Wu angrily retorted experiment subject what do you mean by that the man H Fu laughed loudly and replied you got so close to her and still didn't realize her true identity how foolish sui clutched her head and screamed trying not to confront him stop talking seeing zi Panic hin Fu became even more excited he said it seems that after fleeing for so long the slave nature in your bones hasn't changed confronting your master your instincts will make you feel fear right experiment subject azer xiy haha Yu said with a fierce tone shut up I am not someone who randomly probes into people's private lives nor am I interested in knowing what grudges you have among yourselves but the way you casually make things difficult for my friend is an unforgivable offense today I will settle both your old grudges and new ones with you and hang Jang H Fu looked y Wu up and down angrily saying you're quite arrogant I remember now you were the kid with a bounty on your head named y wo you want is really useless how could he let a kid like you play him around today is just perfect you've not only come to me but I've also brought a big present I must thank you properly the five girls from earlier approached surrounding the two of them Sue he felt a bit scared Yu quickly reassured her don't worry this little trouble isn't enough to pose a threat to me thank you for your warmth but I'm not someone who needs protection scared perhaps but it wasn't ordinary fear it was an uncontrollable anxiety about his own murderous nature a fear of losing his qualification to be human sui quickly transformed into the AER XII experimental form reaching level 110 in no time she released her skills using the five-dimensional Ice Crystal to freeze the five girls surrounding them she thought is this truly the model of my succession excited by her own capabilities she continued to launch her attacks she dodged the blows and swiftly shattered the encircling Force unbearable even in one strike she contemptuously remarked as her five counterparts were repelled seeing sui's abilities yiwu was incredibly astonished that white liquid is artificial plasma he had once seen records related to it in the school library an ancient secret technique a legendary process of biological simulation that has existed for a long time who would have thought Wong Jang would conceal such a technique W pondered most importantly I never expected Ki to be so powerful previously when she fought against me she always restrained her own strength one Fu clapped and exclaimed not bad not bad after leaving you have grown stronger than before truly worthy of being the only successful experiment created from sulu's DNA a semi-simulated clone not only does she possess independent Consciousness but she also has the ability to self- upgrade or AR biological simulations cannot compare to her at all yiu was astonished seemingly grasping the situation so it turns out sui and Kulu have such a relationship thinking back he realized thatu must have also known about sui's existence could it be that susulu proactively suggested using her DNA in exchange for the privilege of freedom of action or did Wong Jen conceal it from her and proceed with the experiment in the shadows H Fu was Furious hurriedly removing his gloves revealing a mechanical arm with Advanced components he shouted truly being in Fortune but not knowing how to enjoy it what is there for a weak creature like a human that you should desire isn't an unbeing body one that can be replaced and improved upon like a simulation far better he continued his voice full of disdain I have spent a great deal of effort and money to enhance myself to escape the frail body of a human yet here you are wishing to become human how ridiculous initially I had planned to allow you to grow freely to reach a higher rank before reclaiming you but since you have come here of your own accord today I will reclaim you directly Upon finishing he snapped his fingers ordering activation instantly five embodiments fused into one forming the evil experiment body a cold voice resonated from the system Fusion complete level 130 Act activating magic module commence execution of the destruction order sui stood opposite him her eyes devoid of fear she spoke with determination H Fu you are wrong I do not crave an undeen body or false power I want to be human a real human only by removing the controlling components within this body can I be truly free she paused momentarily before continuing but luckily I have gathered enough enhancement components as long as I kill you and if escape the control I will be able to become myself Juan foodi laughed the sound filled with mockery a weak creature like you wants to kill me absurd very well let me see what you can do the battle began both charging at each other with Fierce strength and will exu he focused on observing trying to analyze but she could not understand how could a beast level 130 be created if she did not give up her current human form and release all of her final energy she would definitely lose however if she did so the years of hard work she had put in would go to waste but now she had no other choice when sui was about to change her current form she was stopped by Yu wait a minute why do you look so tragic as if you are about to die although this information is a bit overwhelming I haven't even had time to fully understand it but please don't give up so easily even if you don't need my protection don't underestimate my usefulness after all we have been through this together are we not comrades Yu's words left Shu he astonished yiu continued people like that scum are not worth you throwing away yourself sui was Dazed when she felt y Wu gently touch her forehead that light touch made her lose Consciousness the system notification shifted to M's account activating the master technique ability yiu supported kuki generating a level 150 energy shield to protect her and whispered softly just must have a good sleep let me handle the next steps Yu saw the opponent approaching alone quickly adjusting his State and preparing to fight a group of experimental demonic Fusion beings numbered 14 immediately deployed their attack plan to eliminate Yu they determined that given the current level of danger the primary target was the man before them y Wu remained unfazed merely giving a faint smile you're quite perceptive but compared to hate I pity you all much more ye Advanced and shattered the enemy formation with just one hand the fused clones were dismantled upon contact in the astonishment of hang Fu what who exactly is this kid not only did he make Azure XI stop its Rampage immediately but he also easily dismantled my secret weapon his technical level is certainly not ordinary wiin Fu thought in shock seeing the astonished expression of his opponent Yi Wu deliberately provoked further I still had some impression of Wong jang's technique but this is hardly worth mentioning if you have any more toys bring them out for me to broaden my horizons Juan Fu Furious soared High into the air deciding to confront y Wu directly he declared vwo you have skill truly something to be proud of but let's stop here for I will use my Superior technique to turn you into an obedient dog Yi Wu remained calm looking at Juan Fu and replied what Superior Advanced technique to put it bluntly you're nowhere near Master Level in technique if you're capable come over here and let's see who really ends up as the dog that obeys hang Fu concentrated all his Firepower to attack y wo his voice full of arrogance dare to brag in front of me do you not know your own limits turn to dust ye woo chuckled lightly a bit regretful a battle MCH huh unfortunately I don't have a Mech to use right now if I did I would love to control it to fight against you for fun but for now I can only take this opportunity to practice my combat skills a little with my technical account having said that Yi Wu quickly created a barrier preventing the missiles from intruding Juan Fu gave burst into loud laughter haha do you think that just because you can block this round of fire you can dissolve my attack some mave my missiles once they lock onto a Target will chase you down to the death the fir power seemed to have been evaded but suddenly changed dire Direction and chased after y wo however he remained calm snapping his fingers executing precise Maneuvers and disabling all of Wan Fu's missiles in an instant yiu smiled lightly his voice full of implication Nave perhaps so I was once Nave once praying for a world of Peace just as ye Wu finished speaking one Fu's Firepower suddenly changed shape Juan fui panicked and roared damn it my missiles why did they turn into flowers what are you playing at what the hell is this he was surprised when they continued to be inserted into the barrel of a gun one by one Juan Fu in his armor stood days he couldn't help but exclaim damn it what kind of ability is this how can you create such unimaginable things Yi Wu laughed wait until you reach the master level of Technology then you'll understand but I guess that day won't come for you h foodi stubbornly refused to believe what he was witnessing he shook his head his voice full of Doubt nonsense how can a kid like you be a master of Technology besides even if you reached the Master Level you still couldn't have an ability like yours y Wu remained calm his arms crossed as he explained it is precisely because I am a master of technology that I can disregard the suppression level of the Mecca's attack and your technical domain however I have a question weren't you saying that the strongest person Wong Jang it's suu why is your level equivalent to hers ju fui laughed scornfully suu is indeed very strong but in my eyes she is merely a pawn that is why I granted her the highest degree of freedom because she is extremely powerful I can use her genes to create an even stronger simulated Army Yi Wu nodded listening to his analysis unafraid to ask directly you really do enjoy reaping benefits without effort using the to seal off an area is also your tactic isn't it he said I want to trap Han moam fuang letting them kill each other in the end I will come in to clean up the mess ju Fu Dig's face turned pale and he nodded in acknowledgement you are indeed very clever no wonder Ling Yuan valued you so much at the beginning wanting to categorize you as a key reward Target it seems now that you are truly our top enemy hang Jang the level of threat you pose is no less than that of the entire H Mo group with a Target posing such a high threat like you we must eradicate you thoroughly I will show you my strongest State H fui quickly activated the strongest form of The Magic Soup Mecca level 180 y woo instead of being afraid mocked wow the magic sup Mecca 180 is really cool the name you gave it is quite impressive too H fui immediately Unleashed his strongest move which was the Magic bombardment in the face of my enhanced magic attack you have nowhere to hide die the overwhelming attack caused the spot where YW was standing to explode haha I blow you to Smither this is the fate of those who dare to confront me however amidst the Raging Flames ye who appeared completely unharmed without a single wound you really are good at naming things in the field of naming I can see defeat but if we are talking about magic then I will also show my true skills he said said what you are unscathed how is that possible yiwu quickly commanded the system to summon the light witch AAL as he was executing the order the system on Juan Fu's side suddenly sent a message warning warning there is a high energy source above above the base alongside more than 10 stories and a special metal protective layer against nuclear attacks there was nothing else Juan Fu was taken aback to see a strange object falling down a meteorite but how could there be a meteorite underground at a depth of dozens of meters what the hell is this he quickly activated the enhanced magic power Shield but the Shield's value was increasing too slowly to change the situation the magic sup Mecca had only 20% Health left with less than a minute of operational time remaining sui was just beginning to regain Consciousness huh this feeling is so warm in front of her appeared a radiant figure the light witch AAL ail knelt before y wo and expressed my Supreme Master thank you for summoning me may I ask if there is anything you wish to command or do you want me to eliminate your enemies he said no keep the living person there are still many questions to ask him hearing ywk command she quickly carried out the task understood but leave in just a bit of breath the rest I'll play with right thank you master for your grace she swiftly summoned Celestial fire meteor a gigantic Fireball descended from the sky slamming down on the mecca Juan Fu was still struggling but he screamed in despair is that really magic of this caliber after the scream the entire area seemed to be engulfed in flames y Wu felt very satisfied with the decision to use this piece an evil woman who's not so nice it seems this is a villain account but to suppress a level 180 magic sup Mecca without suffering any harm at all the strength of this account has been fully demonstrated although this account can't finish someone off in one blow like the Shadow King it's still useful most importantly it costs nothing and has no side effects one food day lay on the ground pathetically weak with only 2% Health left he coughed weakly his voice filled with resentment yeah I'm still not dead kiddo it's just a kiddo why not just kill me directly to end it haha seeing him holding a Detonator seemingly plotting some something sinister the evil woman quickly used her magic shield and warned Master be careful this guy probably intends to self-destruct wanting to take us down with him Yu frowned and asked self-destruct to die together no no no h foodi laughed loudly my life is worth more than you think how could I do something so foolish this is just a final preservation act at this moment y w notice something unusual so he was screaming loudly a a she appeared in the form of the Azure XII experiment level 160 y Wu exclaimed not good shui is being controlled by that bastard hang fui activated the control mechanism causing sui to scream in agony immediately she Unleashed a massive Ice Crystal AO created a shield to block it causing the Ice Crystal to vaporize H so annoying all these despicable low-level tricks the evil woman growled I've had enough this woman and everything will evaporate from me Yi Wu hurriedly intervened saying ail stop don't hurt sui ail asked somewhat irked huh why is it that this person can't be killed and that person can't be killed leer isn't that being a bit too picky yugu glared what you dare to go against my orders ail immediately panicked hastily denying no no I absolutely wouldn't dare to to think that please forgive me ju foodi laughed hardly Haha I've long set up an interface onui only I can control her this is the insurance mechanism now she has become my puppet not the strongest but the most useful when dealing with you didn't you hesitate to harm her haha upon hearing this The Killing intent in Yu's eyes exploded oh really it seems I have been too merciful I originally intended to keep him alive for some intelligence but now that's no longer necessary y Wu coldly issued the order Evil Woman you know what to do right ail seemingly waiting for this command quickly accepted the order I've been waiting for your words for a long time Master she raised her staff High Gathering radiant light like the sun radiant Glory illumination was Unleashed striking straight toward Von Fu he kept Tui in front of him blocking himself and ran backward while running he commanded azzure XII to cover him for a retreat as he ran Juan foodi anxiously thought damn it the murderous intent is too strong this kid is definitely not a weak and gentle one if I don't leave soon I will truly die at his hands studi raised a crystal barrier to block the light enduring to the point of spitting blood she was completely controlled forced to stay back and take the hits to support hang Fu's escape from ail's Ambush seeing his scheme succeed Juan fui laughed as he ran haha not bad letting you escape before and allowing you to grow has indeed been the right decision keep protecting me he activated the smallscale teleportation device you thought ail's powerful attack has put too much pressure on sui but without Wang Fu's orders sui would endure to the death before stopping compared to killing Guang Fu day I should prioritize saving sui right now half of hang fu his body had stepped through the teleportation door and he laughed heartily haha you've missed a golden opportunity to kill me y wo it's true that Heroes cannot pass through the Beauty's barrier you ultimately couldn't bring yourself to strike I will regroup my forces and come back to settle the score with you the next time we meet will be your day of death then he ordered cruy keep fighting for me azer XI don't stop until death haha after letting Guan fui Escape ail immediately reported to her master the magic signal has been activated no matter how far he runs we can easily track him down Yu nodded well done now switch to defense mode and prepare to approach sui ail replied understood at this moment shuy was exhausted fresh blood trickled from the corner of her mouth but she did not stop despite coughing up blood she continued to unleash powerful moves like endless storm Shu he tried to hold on but she could not avoid the onslaught hearing yiwu's order AAL opened the protective shield shielding him as he approached kugi yiwu instructed now switch the account to MOSI ail immediately complied when sui's blood level was down to 3% her desperate fighting state was nearly at its limit Yu stepped forward placed his hand on her forehead and gently said sleep now I promise I won't let anyone control you again immediately juvi's fighting State ceased she closed her eyes and fell yigu caught her laid her down gently and called out to ivz scans sue his entire body identify any issues and proceed with repairs immediately ail Stood Beside Yu and bid farewell before Vanishing don't forget to summon me again Master y Wu nodded slightly continuing to handle the situation with his usual calmness a vis said leave it to me after the scam was completed announce the scan is complete your body except for the control components still hide self-destruct devices and their power is extremely great Yu nodded and said self-destruct devices fortunately I intentionally let H food to go earlier otherwise forcing him into a corner would definitely lead exu to self-destruct let's proceed with the modification immediately I viz acknowledged the order understood all harmful programs and devices have been completely dealt with the modification is complete after the modification was finished sui slowly regained Consciousness she sensed the changes in her body and wondered is this my body why is it like this yiu smiled and asked you're awake do you feel any changes sui stretched and felt the lightness and comfort she said her voice full of surprise my body feels very different the pressure that has always weighed on my heart has disappeared this is a sense of freedom I have never had before did you do this y Wu nodded and replied yes but unfortunately my ability is still not enough to turn all the Machinery in your body into real flesh and blood in his heart he thought this is probably something Only a God could achieve subie was deeply moved she teared up and said no you have already done too much for me exi continued although my body was controlled before I still had some awareness you not only saved me but also gave me freedom and a second life I really don't know how to repay you she stepped forward took Yu's hand and expressed her sincerity what do you want me to do in return I'm willing to do anything Yu shyly asked um your Sudden Change in attitude is making me a bit confused your demeanor and personality have changed so much he scratched his head and replied if you really want to repay me then give me money I'm in need of a lot of money right now sui chuckled awkwardly upon hearing this money is that really enough seeing her hesitation Yi Wu reminded her softly you clearly said I could ask for anything immediately afterward a notification from the system rang out subie has transferred 500 million to you Yu exclaimed in Surprise 500 million how do you have so much money sui calmly explained I have always been hustling between major safe zones on one hand I'm searching for various components to break the control system in my body on the other hand I've conveniently accumulated quite a bit of money it's all to ensure that when I regain my freedom I can make a clean break Yu then understood so that's how it is no wonder every time I see you you seem so busy and hoo so what are your plans next Sugi replied suddenly having true freedom feels a bit unfamiliar I still feel like I'm an aend days it doesn't feel real but now I've decided to stay by your side and help you eliminate Guang Jang Yu interrupted no although I've repaired your body you have already overexerted yourself before and are still in a weak phase you absolutely need to rest first suie said but I want to help you y Wu remained Resolute then recovered to your best condition otherwise following me now would only be a burden subie turned away I understand I will definitely work hard to restore myself to the best condition she smiled and promised Yu you must wait for me after zi left yiu asked AV Vis hey I Vis did you touch her personality during the repair is this still a cold exi I used to know I viz laughed mischievously haha Master you are still too young you basically don't understand what affection is once a girl like her takes things seriously it could drive you crazy y woo slapped a vis scolding what nonsense are you talking about why don't you go do some research IIs immediately apologized ouch I was wrong Master AIS said anyway we have found the secret base of Juan Fu day in area 8 Yu looked around secretly amazed it seems Juan fui didn't expect me to arrive so quickly how could he not destroy these devices and documents allowing me to take advantage of them a bit I've this continued that's right the master has received the authority of the administrator it's just the right time to download information related to the barrier oh and there's also a surprising discovery IIs pointed to a spot in the room and said there's a secret tunnel down here should we investigate a little Master Yu replied of course since we are here we must explore if we miss out on some Treasures it would be a big loss after that both went down the tunnel Yu felt that this tunnel was quite old when they reached the end of the the path IIs eyes lit up at the scene before them and shouted we have hit the jackpot master in the room at the end of the tunnel they saw many robotic bodies similar to kuui being hung up y Wu exclaimed in astonishment could this place be where kuui is produced there are so many products not yet put into use like this where on Earth did w Jen get these black materials from AIS said I just scanned through it this laboratory is not an ancient Relic but rather a renovated structure possessing a semi Heritage quality yiu observed while responding it seems that Wang Jang has mastered and inherited technology from the old Earth era to some extent otherwise he wouldn't have chosen the path of creating an army of artificial humans these techniques were not very effective even in the old Earth era after all inanimate objects without Souls cannot develop or evolve I this disagreed looking at him and retorting that statement isn't necessarily true true these things may look like a pile of scrap metal but in the hands of your master they can turn waste into treasure you understand that with so many Exquisite and beautiful bodies doesn't the master think about creating his own her Mary yiu laughed and said that suggestion isn't bad but let's skip the herum I'm more interested in the Army at least this would be useful in enhancing the reserve combat strength you should scan again to see what materials are needed to activate them I've this complained while working yes I'll do it right away y Wu happily said it seems that the basic body manufacturing has been completed however we are still lacking the core driving energy source as long as we have high-grade magic crystals we can activate it this is easy last time in the dungeon of the insect species I extracted a large amount of high-grade magic crystals we can just use them Let's test 30 of them after all this is a legion the number cannot be too small I've received the order and replied yes I will immediately help the master select suitable bodies but first we need to modify the low-level command so that they know to follow your leadership I suggest testing six bodies initially to check first after saying that I Vis walked along the machines and performed a series of strange operations after a while the process was completed just then the exu heat shaped machines opened their eyes they immediately rushed towards yiu Yu thought they were going to attack him and exclaimed what's going on is there a system error however these girls did not attack but instead embraced him and affectionately called out Master this scene left y wo speechless he asked in confusion ha what is happening IES Iz grinned mischievously and explained haha what's wrong when I modified the low-level command I adjusted a bit of their personality attributes now they are no longer longer cold than distant y Wu angrily said I knew it was you kiddo playing tricks hurry up and change it back for me after giving a vis a memorable beating i v Vis while crying repaired his attributes back to normal ywu breathed the sigh of relief that's better I Vis inquired about the location of the energy transport points of the barrier in zone one despite the pain from a lumps on his head I viz responded oh yes the robots knelt down earnestly waiting for orders please give us your commands Master after scanning we have the specific results regarding the spatial location of the base y Wu commanded there are a total of three energy transport points split up and take action you six divide into two teams destroy points A and B Point c will be handled by me The Robots replied receive the order they quickly switched to combat Readiness once everything was prepared Yu led the Army let's go head towards the battlefield the six replied in unison yes at safe Zone Bri the energy transport station Yi Wu observed two individuals standing in front of the gate he thought to himself the guards are still chatting it seems Guan Fu hasn't notified them yet I remember their uniforms are from the Tian chuang Corporation tan chuong is responsible for building infrastructure so it's reasonable for them to provide the energy he thinks it is just that after the Betrayal Trail of the red tailed Devil Dragon hang Jang could still accept Tian chuang which surprised many people the two guards saw the stranger entering and immediately Drew their guns as a warning stop who are you raise your hands then leave if not I will shoot Yu raised both hands and calmly said don't shoot I am just an ordinary citizen wi jandu and Shen bang stepped forward Wang jenu greeted him with a faint smile if you consider yourself and ordinary citizen then the definition of ordinary in the dictionary must be updated he turned to the two guards step back this character is not someone you can mess with the two guards replied in unison understood y Wu chuckled and asked is that so am I now famous to that extent wine jangu replied I am somewhat knowledgeable about the news and it seems that no one is unaware of the great name of V Wu how are your father and mother doing these days y Wu responded thanks to Blessings they are now very safe W Jong go nodded that's good however you are a person of hando if you have appeared here your purpose must be clear Yu did not beat around the bush he said bluntly we are all smart people here so I won't mince words my purpose is to destroy the energy transport devices I hope you won't hinder me Yu said I don't want to cause any unnecessary casualties either the two guards immediately became angry one shouted kiddo talking big let's see if we can shoot you full of holes however wine jenu immediately intervened foolish if you want to live stop right now Yu calmly replied Captain Wang you have a Grace towards me I don't want to make things difficult for you I hope you won't resist for no reason but if you want resist the only outcome will be death Wang Jen Gul tried to persuade him the barrier of safe Zone own one is maintained by several secret energy outposts linked together to Supply Power if they are not shut down simultaneously it will not be effective if forced to destroy them the residual energy will cause a massive explosion harming civilians you are not that kind of person are you y woo at that moment the communication device rang with urgent announcements A hurried voice came through the energy Outpost of Zone 4 is under attack by the enemy we can't hold on zone 5 is also being ambushed requesting immediate support the enemy consists of three level one women we are completely outmatched the connection was cut Wang jangu trembled and asked is this also your plan yiu replied you are a smart man now you have two choices either follow Tian chuang and be Huang jang's dog continuing this aimless life or join me and help me eliminate Guang Jen the two guards heard this and said kid are you telling a joke our team leader is betraying the organization to follow you team leader let us kill this kid who is spouting nonsense in the tense atmosphere Wang jangu remained silent after a moment he slowly said you are right instead of continuing down a path with no future I would rather trust him my intuition and experience tell me that a person is unpredictable as him will surely achieve great things in the future the two guards were taken aback claiming what team leader are you crazy how can you trust a kid with an unknown background do you know what the consequences of betraying the organization will be we jeno replied his voice Resolute I certainly understand if you believe in my judgment then stay if not you can leave one of the guards immediately said you must be crazy we're not going to lose our minds with you they quickly ran off shaming loudly hurry up report the situation here to the hups and request reinforcement only Shen Bing stayed behind we Jen goo looked at him and asked Shen Bing do you agree to stay Shen Bing nodded responding firmly of course I Will Follow You team leader after persuading them yiu stood up and said since we are all acquaintances that's good let's go the main work is more important Shen Bing said all right but his state was a bit strange his eyes were cloudy and bloodshot just as Yu stepped forward exposing a gap behind him Shen bang drew the hidden knight from his body aiming straight at Yu to kill my responsibility is to take your life he growled however before the blade could touch y wo it was halted by the weapon yiu had hidden behind his back Shin Bing was astonished unable to believe it how is this possible he stammered a cold glint flashed in Yu's eyes he calmly said you dare to sneak attack me people like you usually die very miserably Wang Jango witnessing the whole incident could not help but be surprised he shouted loudly Shen Bing are you crazy why are you attacking Yu Shen Bing's face was twisted and terrifying he replied Captain do you still remember kin Ru that name shocked Wong jongo but he still didn't understand kin Ru why mention her now Shen ban pointed the knife directly at y Wu his voice trembling but full of determination it was y Wu who killed kin Ru Wang Jango frowned his expression full of Doubt what are you sure Shen bang nodded affirming absolutely a surviving colleague from area 9 witnessed it with his own eyes he told me right after waking up from the coma Shen Bing said when kin Ru was killed by the Beast yiu was right beside her he clearly could have saved her but just stood by and watched letting her be killed after that he even lied that kin Ru died protecting him how could someone so strong need someone else to protect him why didn't he save her Shin Bing was in pain his voice full of anger after my parents were killed by beasts I didn't want to live anymore as my future wife she helped me find the courage to continue living kin Ru was the light the only hope I had but now that Hope Has vanished I have struggled to live until today just to take revenge after saying that Shen Bing collapsed in agony wine jeno looked at the scene and couldn't help but feel heartbroken immediately calling out Shen ban y Wu remained silent for a moment then spoke that colleague of yours only saw the scene of kin Ru being killed but didn't see the moments before that when she pushed me away to lure the Beast and then ran away of herself he continued speaking to Shen Bing I do not deny that I stood by and watched her die but tell me what obligation do I have to save someone who wants to harm me in fact I didn't intend to reveal this truth after all for you all it would be even more brutal wouldn't it Shen Bing resolutely did not believe this cannot be true you're lying to me kin Ru has always been gentle and kind she could never do something like this Yi Wu turned his back and walked away calmly saying I've said what I needed to say whether you believe it or not is up to you I have other matters to attend to Shen ban like an unrelenting wraith would not let go and step forward to block Yu he shouted stop I'm not done with you yet we Jen go tried to intervene Shen bang calm down don't get agitated seeing the situation Yi Wu immediately threw a punch at Shen bang you won't leave me alone huh consider this a warning the punch was so forceful that Shen Bing's health bar dropped to 10% he screamed in pain oh my God Yu coldly said I don't have time to waste with you this punch is the final warning Shen Bing was kned down to the tille floor stammering so strong too strong holding the photo of him and kin Ru in his hand Shen Bing side if I were as strong as you could I have protected her it's just a Pity I have no tomorrow left then as if he had made a final decision Shen ban took out a test tube and drank it all why Jen Goa was stunned Shen Bing what you just drank is Shen Bing's body quickly transformed into a beast he let out a roar that echoed his power surging as he reached level 80 Wang jangu was astonished Beast transformation potion how did you get this Yi Wu stood there his expression still calm he spoke I can understand the pain of losing someone you love but if you have chosen this path then there is no turning back y Wu didn't want to waste any more time he used a large flame to burn Shen Bing Wang Jango shouted no Shen Bing in the blazing fire Shen Bing softly said in the end we can finally be together the great fire not only consumed Shen Bing but also burned the memorial photo of him and kin Ru W Jong guo heartbroken couldn't understand damn it why are you so stupid living is clearly more important as long as you live there is hope why do you have to give up foolish ywu cly replied not everyone has the courage to face despair there are times when living is more painful than death this is the pain of this era he contemplated inwardly if I didn't have the Kingpin account system in my desire to become stronger I might have walked the same path at Shen Bing and Senior anchang having this system is it natural for me or is it luck then Yu said let's go I will not stop my steps because of this you can hate me but do not block my path Wang Jen go shook his head in this apocalyptic era weakness is a sin without enough power hatred has no meaning I still need to use you to help me become stronger therefore I Will Stand By Your Side Y Wu immediately said thank you for your honesty now we should go to activate the energy Transportation devices as the two approach the energy core a dazzling golden formation suddenly appear in the sky Yu frowned and asked what is that formation Wang Jang guu looked up his voice serious that is the exclusive secret art of the Tian chuang group it is a hexagram portal but why is it appearing in zone one from within the teleportation formation Talisman countless horrifying beasts rained down like a storm they shrieked excitedly ha eat all humans haha Yi Wu and Wang Jango were taken aback a demon Beast ywu gritted his teeth his gaze icy it seems that the leaders of your tan chuong have betrayed Humanity as well bringing the Beast teleportation Talisman to the safe zone are you whoopy to fish in Troubled Waters for profit or seeking revenge on Wang Jang and hanmo Wang Jang go Furious clenched his fists this is outrageous regardless of their intentions it is the common people who suffer y Wu nodded firmly we cannot let them achieve their goals change of plans we can no longer activate the barrier we must prioritize destroying the teleportation Talisman we jangu agreed I understand I will stay here and wait for orders when you need to activate the energy Tower just contact me at safety zone no one the headquarters Han Mo Moen long along with M and M we're in the meeting room Mo Zen long said Gravely peace in the southwest safety zone has been maintained for 50 years today are we facing a great disaster of life and death again Moi immediately reported father according to the intelligence just received the barrier in zone one is a plot by juang Fu the teleportation Talisman that the beasts infiltrated through was sabotaged by the technical supervisor of tan chuang hearing this Mo zun long snorted ha throwing away relationships so quickly Juan Fu and tan chuong neither of them is lacking in ability Moki commented in the safety zone it seems peaceful but in reality an underground current is surging The Grudges accumulated over the past decade finally erupted I wonder if we can control this situation in her heart she thought why woo everyone in the safety zone outside the barrier can only rely on you now Moen long took a deep breath his voice contemplative man proposes God disposes we only need to focus on doing our part he turned to Moi and asked does wang Fu she and TI and chuong have any movements at the moment Moi replied none apart from the information exchanged earlier both Wang fuen and Tian chuong have remained Silent not making any moves rashly Mo zun long silently thought this miraculous state of balance if it can be maintained would be great but I fear that those scheming individuals will not allow us to have our way at that moment a teleportation t Talisman appeared in the sky from it emanated Eerie rays of light causing everyone to panic a powerful forces Gathering preparing to explode from the portal the atmosphere is tense and everyone seems to sense that something incredibly terrifying is about to descend from the teleportation Talisman a colossal creature emerged striking fear into the hearts of the people that is the world boss Thunder Demon Lynn level 180 with a massive and fierce form he exuded a destructive Aura as if he wanted to annihilate the entire world Thunder Demon Lynn spoke in a majestic cold voice oh the defense level of this barrier is not bad humanss are indeed a species that hides in their shells only knowing how to retrieve into their own safety behind him was a vast Army of monsters their overwhelming presence suffocating he glanced over the safe Zone and sneered well let you live a little longer after all my purpose is not here you all kill to your heart's content for me the monsters behind him burst into Savage laughter ha kill all the humans from the top of a building ywu observed his gaze sharp he silently thought this world boss looks so much like the different akal level 12 star from before Yu continued it's just a higher level without the Shadow King it's truly not easy to deal with we can't confront at head-on We Must Destroy the teleportation Talisman first then it to a less populated area to avoid significant casualties as for the other beasts let them handle it after that Yu commanded awaken bionic girl group The Bionic girl group immediately responded at your command my master they SAR out of the base starting the operation to eliminate the beasts fire the bullets were fired with immense attacking power automatically tracking leaving the beasts dumbfounded ah what's happening this kind of suppression Firepower made them scatter in panic running and screaming these things are not humans at all run fast ah an individual called Azure 14 contacted Yu this is azure 14 please give the command master Yu issu the command the boss Army is advancing toward you but there's no need to get close just focus on Exterminating the beasts around you additionally split your forces to guard other safe areas and wait for orders as your for acknowledged the command understood Master after that he calculated the front line has almost finished arranging but the rear still has an important place that needs attention Al over four of Wong Jan's forces took action L Fang and the others have been assigned to the school for defense now that the war has escalated they must be redeployed y Wu simultaneously contacted three people the first to respond was the principal V woo you suddenly contacted me is there some mus situation huh missu is also here Yu replied time is of the essence I will explain everything to everyone due to TI chuang group's betrayal a world boss level 180 has appeared in area 2 and the Beast Army is advancing towards other safe zones with levels ranging from 70 to 90 saou was surprised what the monsters are almost at the levels of the different account our current defenses definitely cannot handle them especially since we are still wearing down against Wong Jang Lu Fang on the other hand was extremely excited is in another fight with a significant power disparity Bring it on I can level up at will again senior what do you meet us to do Yu said principal please help to bring the students and nearby residents to the underground shelter to avoid disaster L Fang and ruing tanan you two continue to defend and I will send reinforcements to assist Yu continued on Miss side it is best to convince the people from Wang Jang to join forces against us if it cannot be persuaded do not force it protecting oneself is the top priority my reinforcements will arrive soon the three of them understood the current situation clearly and the principal replied all right I will do it after the previous Invasion Mis Mo also sent people to help us strengthen the Refuge now dealing with an attack from a level 90 Beast should not be a major issue you also said I understand y woo you must pay attention to your safety as well Lu Fang cheered senior do your best we will wait for news from you about the elimination of the world boss after arranging everything for the rear Yu took to the sky he thought to himself with this there are no more worries for the future it will all be over soon ahead he encountered two Monsters the level 95 black-winged bat King saw y Wu flying towards him and thinking he was an easy target grin smugly a fool has come knocking at my door I haven't even eaten yet today ha the level 85 greeny Birdman next to him joined in haha save me a piece brother however Yu flew by like a gust of wind saying Let It Go the two monsters were instantly engulfed in flames from Yu screaming in pain ah as yiu flew closer to the teleportation Talisman gate he unleashed the explosive flame dragon pill six link a distance sufficient to destroy the teleportation Talisman when the teleportation Talisman gate was destroyed Yu turned to look at the world boss contemplating this way I can smoothly draw the boss's hatred and leave however the Thunder Demon Lynn continued to attack the civilians causing y Wu to feel puzzled it actually disregards the destruction of the teleportation Talisman moreover it charged straight outside could it be that it its true intention is to sabotage the main city wall of the safe Zone worry y Wu immediately activated the shadow flame form and rushed forward he said damn it once the city wall is destroyed the wild beasts will flood in at that point the situation will become even more chaotic this guy looks Reckless but turns out to be cunning like this I must quickly stop it even so Yu's Shadow flame form only managed to deal 1% of Thunder Demon lynk's Health he was frustrated what is this the shadow flame form can't do anything to it this thing is too strong is it due to the difference in size if so then I can only try to block it flame demon y Wu immediately activated flame demon control a gigantic flame demon body appeared blocking Thunder Demon Lynn preventing it from crashing into the buildings and civilians Yu was overjoyed great finally succeeded in holding the boss however Thunder Demon Lynn was very strong it contemptuously said you think you could stop me with such little power how naive you know nothing about true strength then Thunder Demon Lynn used its power to push back the flame demon putting y Wu in a difficult position what it actually used Force to push back the flame demon damn it with this overwhelming power in defense what can I do to stop it just then wine Jango contacted him and you asked Captain Wong is there any update W jangu replied I've been watching the situation of your battle closely to Halt this kind of boss you will need weapons of equal caliber immediately go to the address I sent you it hides the secret invention of tyen chuong a humanoid weapon which should be useful to you Yi Wu responded tyen chuong has this kind of thing okay I'll go take a look but then he hesitated although the distance to the secret weapon is not far as long as I leave the battle I can't hold the boss what should I do suddenly Yu came up with an idea that's right I still have that then he commanded you should appear now come here the army of the insect species immediately he summoned the magic Crystal insect heart and the system announc summon magic Crystal insect heart is a special ability that only those with royal blood can use allowing the summoning of an endless Army of the insect species to fight the insect species appeared in a grand manner their numbers increasing rapidly the scene caused everyone to panic and worry the screams echoed it's the insect species the insect species are starting to invade we're doomed however some quickly noticed something unusual huh they don't even bother to look at us what is going on moreover they are attacking the boss in the sky the insect species flew around shooting beans from their mouths at attacking the monsters the monster enraged roared ah damn it you insects dare to lay hands on me no you are not the insect species from the present world what on Earth is this at this moment everyone was bewildered not understanding what was happening some began to doubt exclaiming in disbelief could it be that they are protecting us how is this possible how can the insect species protect humans ye who stood to the side and seeing this showed a sense of relief it's effective now although the attack power is still insufficient it's enough to disturb the boss's State and resentment this way we could buy a little time quickly go check out tyan chuong's secret weapon having said that Yi Wu immediately cast teleportation magic to the hidden base underground of tan chuang GR in front of him a tall black humanoid robot appeared on the robot was labeled Dragon Hunter 4 version with a level reaching 165 yiu was somewhat surprised muttering is this the secret humanoid weapon of tan chuang the level is fine but the appearance is not my taste he turned to I Vis and asked can this be modified a bit I Vis confidently replied it can be done but it will take time youu nodded and ordered then start quickly I want to fight side by side with my old teammates again I viz swiftly accepted the command and began the task a series of energies radiated out with thousands of lightning bolts enveloping the Dragon Hunter the structural analysis process has been completed followed by disassembly and reorganization to carry out the enhancement operation countdown time 15 minutes countdown Time 5 minutes enhancement completed after the enhancement the drive-in Hunter had evolved into Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version you looked at the mech before him unable to hide his satisfaction this is the mech of my dreams y will continue long time no see teammate let's go so that guy knows my strength on this side the monster was very angry shouting stop disturbing me you bug using damaged attacks to kill the small insect species that Dar to attack it at this moment the two reporters beside were not afraid of danger at all on the contrary they were cheerfully running forward with their cameras to capture footage the camera is unmanned no way to get close only able to shoot handheld at a close distance although it's dangerous this battle footage is truly valuable the shock of the great battle of the insect species Monster World the reason behind it being this tomorrow's headline is mine haha the grob deide was a bit more timid said worriedly senior is your topic related to the fake negative news that appeared earlier about Wang Jen but we should still hurry up this place is really too dangerous the reporter rushed forward replying don't be AF afraid let me take you flying one time but just then the shock wave shattered everything turning it all to smoke the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil was hit and fell down to the ground now it was only at 20% Health everyone was truly shocked a the insect species actually came to save humans everyone was buzzing tomorrow's headline will have new materials truly shocking amidst the conversation a monster standing aside sneered to be part of an insect species yet protect Humanity how ridiculous the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil Furious slowly stood up coughed a few times and roared back who said my master is human if he has the right to command us I will definitely risk my safety for him hearing this the monster grew even angrier erupting with rage it stomped its foot hard causing the abyss Mammoth Weevil to once again crumble to the ground a human is a master is it that kid from before how could you accept such a human as your master the dignity our Beast kind is truly tarnished by worthless creatures like you weakness only leads to One path death even with blood and energy running low the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil still struggled to respond dying alongside us is nothing regrettable as long as I fulfill the mission my master entrusted to me the Beast roared Mission what mission at that moment from a distance a cannonball shot straight towards them striking the Beast back causing it to Roar who who dares to Ambush me scarlet Phantom the strong attack version confidently retorted who else could it be but me what do you remember me after saying that he Unleashed his full Firepower in front of him Beast caught off guard had to retreat to defend himself Beast smirked mockingly the mecca you actually have some skill no wonder you can make those bugs loyal and devoted although indeed According to some values you can only enhance the frail body of your kind but you'll never compare to my perfect body home through countless trainings after that he braced himself displaying the power of Thunder Demon level 180 in this urgent situation the system suddenly flashed a warning message warning warning ammunition depleted Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version also found himself in a difficult position murmuring this Beast is really tough I've exhausted my ammunition and he's only lost 30% of his health however the focus of my upgrades this time isn't on Firepower but on close combat taking advantage of the moment he rushed in and threw a strong punch at Beast causing his opponent to lose another 10% of Health Beast laughed loudly mocking is that all the strength you have after saying that Beast retaliated fiercely against Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version he felt a bit panicked as his health dropped to only 60% in his heart he was bewildered thinking so strong in addition to defense his attack power is equally impressive he fell and caused the entire building to collapse fortunately this battle took place in a construction area with a low population density otherwise the clash between the two giants could have involved countless people he thought to himself now if I only rely on Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version I cannot defeat the Beast I need to change my strategy if its goal is to attack the main city then will take advantage of the technique to enhance the defensive strength of the city walls to prevent the beast from breaking in as for the high level monster I will prolong the fight for as long as possible Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version launched missiles into the sky the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil smudy said now you think of running away isn't it too late it laughed maliciously but before it could finish its sentence it realized it was being held back by something ah what is this thousands of modified self- exploding devices clung to its body and exploded in succession the Abyssal Mammoth Weevil screamed in pain and anger its Health percentage dropping to 50 enough don't think that using these tricks will allow you to win against me I have lost interest in you go die after holding on for a while Scarlet Phantom the St attack version had completed the enhancement of the city walls so it confidently responded I am not so arrogant as to think I can defeat you I am am just thinking of ways to thwart your schemes the boss smiled sinisterly yet you managed to see through my intentions as a human that is quite impressive could it be that you've killed different e cow well that's quite possible but do you really think that reinforcing the city walls can stop my Beast Army Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version looked puzzled what do you mean at that moment an urgent report was transmitted report Master there is an emergency safe Zone 2 has detected a new teleport a Talisman The Beast Army is pouring in again I'm sending the images to you yiu was stunned and could hardly believe it what this teleportation Talisman is the Gate of Flesh and Blood void Yu murmured his face filled with astonishment I never expected a new teleportation Talisman to be set up in zone 2 could this be their real goal damn it this must be a premeditated strategy a strategy using highle monsters to draw the main fire then take the opportunity to invade the rear could it be that highlevel beasts have evolved intelligence suddenly a monster attacked cutting off all of Yu's thoughts and shattering Scarlet Phantom the strong attack version the boss continued to speak his voice filled with provocation are you underestimating me or have you become so desperate that you've lost your fighting Spirit y Wu hurriedly spread his wings and jumped outside he said goodbye comrade your mission has been accomplished I look forward to our next meeting the boss interjected his cold laughter echoing letting go this is just meaningless resistance as soon as the words left his mouth the boss crushed everything destroying it all a loud explosion rang out and Y Wu quickly fled from the scene he told himself I must quickly return to destroy the second teleportation Talisman in the short time before the boss launches another round of explosions I have to find a way to deal with him after flying for a while you woo suddenly stopped staring blankly at the scene before him in the sky the Sun and the Moon hung side by side he thought in astonishment does this mean my system can simultaneously summon the twin witch the system spoke up with a warning although the underlying mechanism of the account allows for this method it is not recommended for use because the magic power consumed will be four times the normal amount furthermore after the summoning you will be debuffed into a forbidden magic State the system explained in the Forbidden magic State you will not be able to use any magic and the duration can last up to 24 hours at that moment the boss had caught up he sneered his voice full of killing intent I have endured your ridiculous attacks long enough initially I didn't want to pay attention to an insignificant insect like you but now I must kill you in a rush y Wu had no other choice no matter the cost I will do it without fail he raised his voice firmly hear my summoning command and come appear Twin Witches ail and avna the boss widened his eyes in Surprise standing still to see what iwu was planning he sneered magic is so ridiculous what can a mere spell do to me just as the summoning ritual was completed the twin witches appeared immediately attacking and annihilating the boss both said in unison thank you for your summoning master your enemy has been completely destroyed do you have any further commands ail standing beside couldn't help but yell in Anger wait avna don't steal my lines you idiot Yu felt dizzy unable to suppress a Grimace ah my head hurts it seems summoning the Two Witches at once is still a bit too much but I must persevere seeing y woo in pain the Two Witches hurriedly asked in unison Master are you okay ail annoyed turned to avna get out of my way avna can't you see Master is suffering like this it must be because of your dark energy avna refused to back down retorting sharply why not you disappear instead your blinding energy is the one putting pressure a master the two parties argued incessantly it can't be like this the master has summoned me before and now it's the second time I was here first what avna exclaimed unable to accept it asking again while the two were arguing fiercely boss suddenly came back to life ah so noisy kid you haven't died yet everyone immediately turned back looking at Ghana with disbelief huh you're still alive under the full force of our attacks your skin is so tough It's astonishing AAR sees the opportunity promptly blaming it's definitely because you Anna didn't use your full power that's why this creature was lucky to survive Anam retorted angrily what are you saying it turns out Thunder Demon Lynn had merely fainted he still had 1% Health left to be able to force a top tier Defender like me into this situation you all are indeed not bad but just one step short my mission could have been completed therefore I will sacrifice my life to pave the way for the Swarm to level up saying that boss unexpectedly Unleashed his power using locked rage this is his racial trait burning his life force to exchange for the state of lock Rage which has the ability to nearly defend against all attacks however this state only lasts for 1 minute and afterward he will surely die y Wu panicked not good the boss wants to destroy the main wall within 1 minute of becoming Champion we need to think of a way to stop it he hurriedly asked the twin witches do you not have any ultimate technique that can negate the boss's blood saturation State avna replied we do have one but this technique consumes an enormous amount of magic power and will also put greater pressure on the master ail added the most important thing is I absolutely do not want to cooperate with avna to use the same technique the situation is already extremely urgent the boss has obtained a 100% energy Shield ywu saw that the two witches were unwilling to cooperate he quickly urged although I can understand that you were born with conflicting attributes you need to put that aside for now and focus your spiritual power to take down the boss for me otherwise what use do I have for you seeing Yu serious attitude the Two Witches truly felt a bit scared and quickly nodded in agreement yes yes master we will comply saying that each witch grabbed one of Yo's hands he felt a bit confused and spoke up wait a minute what do you want to do avna calmly said if we want to fuse then of course it must be done with the master what he who did not have time to prepare himself when the light appeared summoned into battle they had fused into Twin Star demon god cows at that moment the boss's energy Shield vanished leaving only 20% of its Integrity the boss seen the fusion wondered what are you doing as long as I have not released the locked rage State all attacks against me are useless I will die but I will never be killed by you as soon as the words left the boss's mouth he was pulled into another space huh where is this place the boss was surprised just a glance and I've been dragged in here this must be an illusion a massive source of energy emerged from the solar Matrix passing through the battlefield Matrix directly entering the Twin Star demon god cows at this moment Twin Star demon god cows remained very confident no me no matter what tricks you use you can't break my locked rage Twin Star demon god KS basically paid no attention to the boss's words they unleashed the magic dimension of sun and moon convergence directly attacking the boss the boss was smashed to Pieces crying out in pain a why you use a power that transcends the Norms of this world Twin Star demon god KO stood by not intervening as the boss fell from the sky and turned to dust the mission was complete and it was time for the twin witches to leave ail Bid Farewell to Yu I can only accompany you this far Master the next time we meet will be a long time away we will be very lonely a also spoke up please do not forget us we will be ready waiting for your next summoning farewell Master yiu jumped to the ground his expression weary even though he had defeated this powerful boss the feeling of his body being hollowed out was truly uncomfortable the system notification appeared this battle consumed 40% of your magic power you have entered a forbidden magic State for the next 120 hours you cannot summon the twin witches again Yu really did not expect that the battle would consume more than 40% of his magic power one strike costing him 400 magic power no wonder it's a higher tier magic he thought feeling as if his heart were bleeding although he had never thought he would become a savior at least the task of preventing the collapse of the entire safe Zone was a consolation now only the mission of the teleportation Talisman in the secondary it remained y Wu continued but no matter how urgent the time is the loot must be collected let's see what equipment we have harvested this time the system displayed a notification congratulations host for killing the world monster you have received 80 million experience 10 million magic power 150 million gold coins 500 level 160 epic gr magic crystals and a territory key which can be opened with a key the territory is based on plunder using this key can activate the personal territory of strange beasts the higher the level the greater the danger faced please use it with caution the system continued demon wings a flying cloak that can enhance physical defense magic and flying speed you have gained the qualification to travel in the demon Dimension upon hearing this yiu was delighted the items are not many but all of them are of high quality I have accumulated two territory Keys now after this crisis passes I must use them to rake in money what else is mentioned in the demon wings about the demon Dimension forget it I will study it later the top priority now is to quickly resolve the teleportation Talisman gate in area 2 Yu asked the system what is the situation of the teleportation Talisman gate now the system replied Master there are many highlevel beasts nearby the teleportation Talisman gate around levels 90 to 100 we currently have 20 people but we still cannot break through the blockade additionally 10 more people are on their way after equipping his weapon y Wu immediately jump forward got it you all focus on reducing the number of beasts I'll handle the teleportation Talman the system replied yes he suddenly thought there is one thing I have always noticed the strange Beast before once said a line about dedicating its life to pave the way for the Swarm to level up but what does this path to level up mean the beasts wanting to level up must certainly consume humans but that can only be low-level beasts so could this path to level up be for highlevel beasts or a means to help the strange Beast level up before long Yu had flown to the bright red gate he thought to himself the speed of this demon wings is truly astonishing it seems that demons are indeed better suited for dark Flames furthermore The Forbidden magic State before did not seem to affect the other accounts is this the benefit of having multiple accounts counts next I just need to destroy the last teleportation Talisman to end this battle immediately Yi Wu unleashed the flame dragon incendiary bullet striking directly at the teleportation Talisman suddenly the teleportation Talisman emitted a bright light and began to move a level board appeared but the data was unclear the figure in the teleportation Talisman is suddenly yiu activated the eye of positioning his gaze darkening he was surprised the eye of positioning activated on its own could it be sensing the tremendous pressure from the teleportation Talisman the monster behind the teleportation Talisman finally appeared it is a level 300 Demon King the Lord of swan wo at level 300 the malice emanating from it is truly frightening Yu's body could no longer move is this the pressure of level 300 just one glance one powerful Aura was enough to render me unable to breathe Yu firmly said we cannot let it escape from the teleportation Talisman otherwise that monster will flee at this moment y's four female subordinates also appeared they apologized saying sorry Master we were late y simply replied it's all right consider it as arriving just in time you all continue to eliminate the other monsters all four responded clearly in unison understood Yu with a frightening expression silently thought it has been a long time since I experienced such a feeling of helplessness and fear emanating from the very depths of my soul this pressure compared to the ancient gods in my dreams before is truly more realistic the true nature of this level is it really level 300 Yu continued that's too exaggerated even the history books in school don't have specific records of How High the upper level of this world truly is suddenly a level 110 exotic bat attack from behind Yu it roared dare to disrupt our teleportation Talisman I will swallow you whole yiu Stood Still waiting for the monster to come closer as it approached he suddenly struck out with a palm causing it to scream ah he thought to himself what am I afraid of so what if it's level 300 then he raised his sword in front of him his gaze firm telling himself I will clear all the obstacles in my path no matter how high the level of my opponent is I will not stop until I become the strongest after a moment four female subordinates returned reporting to the master the beasts within a 500 met radius have been cleared please instruct on the next action Y Wu nodded and replied well done next continue to maintain the subgroup actions as before heading to the safe zones and continue to eliminate the remaining beasts all of them responded in unison understood Master then they quickly left and you wve asked hey missu I remember that each safe Zone has a radar station to monitor the quantity and location of beasts do you have the authority to check it she replied yes but right now all the radar stations before the Beast centry have been sabotaged by someone else currently they are in the process of being repaired he said so could you please send me all the radar coordinates she replied just a moment he gazed into the distance thinking of himself now I must know the exact number and location of the remaining beasts I can't allow any of them to escape they must all be exterminated before we can open the barrier I can only hope that the situation inside the barrier isn't too tense at Sector 5 at the monitoring radar station the staff looked at the severely damaged equipment and cursed in frustration damn it fixing these things is too Troublesome that damn T and chuong made them but don't have any spare part at all where the hell can I find them now suddenly the loud noises outside went silent one person suspiciously said huh why did the gunfire outside stop could it be everyone has been killed by the beasts another person retorted fear evident in their voice don't don't say that if it really is like that won't we definitely die too in panic they fired their guns continuously at the door one person shouted aha don't come over here the door opened and Yi Wu stepped in calmly fortunately he had a shield otherwise he would have been pierced by those bullets everyone in the room was surprised by his appearance no need to worry the beasts outside have all been eliminated by me everyone is safe now someone said is this true thank you so much one of them spoke up I truly apologize for shooting at you are you all right young man yigu replied I'm fine the ones who should be thanked are me you all did not shy away from danger and steadfastly held your positions just this alone is enough for all the citizens in the safe Zone to respect you he said holding the position is only natural right another person said with a tough demeanor I'm not the kind of person who fears death but let's be honest who are you this place is not for a kid like you to come up to ywu calmly answered I came to help repair the radar station hearing this the staff in the of were astonished huh are you joking what can a kid like you do one person mocked and added hey don't touch my radar if you break it you won't be able to pay for it just then the system announced the radar station has been fully repaired the room fell silent in astonishment the ragar system monitoring the safe Zone displayed the waves scanning the number and distribution of beast in the area after a few seconds the scanning results were complete the number of invaded beasts remaining in the safe zone is 486 a staff member shouted what did you really fix the entire radar I'm not dreaming am I the whole group of employees gasped I didn't expect it could be repaired so easily something even the senior couldn't do one person in the group asked Hey kid what exactly is your background y Wu just waved his hand turned around but did not forget to leave a sentence I'm just an ordinary person with a passionate heart 486 beasts are not too dangerous it shouldn't be a problem to leave them to them however the beasts concentrated at the school I need to deal with them personally the important thing is that I need to ask the principal some matters at that moment in the safe Zone beneath the school tanan and luang were trying to block the swarm of beasts outside the door a beast growled if we can break through this door we can have a feast haha Ty tyan shouted principal you and the teachers need to retreat inside we will hold on for a while longer the principal shook his head and said how can I let you face the danger instead of us tyen tyen confidently replied principal don't worry luckily we have trained a little in the dungeon before I can handle these monsters at this moment tin tan still had 85% of his health but Lu Fang was not much better with only 70% left Lu Fang reminded everyone must be careful sudden suddenly a purple flame erupted from somewhere incinerating the entire swarm of beasts y Wu walked in nonchalant looked around and asked is everyone okay someone shouted senior y wo the principal approached to praise I didn't expect that in such a short time apart you have grown to this extent you are truly the pride of our Academy y woo being polite replied principal you flatter me facing that strange Beast world just now was merely a narrow Victory after a fierce battle how can a level 180 be so high the world boss is only level 90 after all ywo with his purple eyes said this is also my question but that is not the most important thing the most important thing is that just now I saw a terrifying level 300 boss in the teleportation Talisman hearing this everyone was in a panic what level 300 yo you're not joking are you such an absurd thing is truly about to shake scatter human World Views Yi Wu replied unfortunately this is the truth therefore principal I now have two questions I would like to ask you first what is the actual level of Earth after the era of the global drought is there a specific record second according to the Academy's documents in the past 100 years the level of invading beasts has never exceeded level 180 why have there been continuous appearances of levels 90 180 and even 300 recently what is their true purpose the principal responded you have finally realized this issue haven't you principal sighed heavily it seems that the time has come you all follow me next you will see and hear top secret news like never before the group followed and they arrived at the hidden Library underground until now they had no idea that the school concealed such an ancient liary this place is a forbidden area only the principles of past Generations were allowed to enter but this rule is no longer important I will answer the first question from the student you woo the principal called out a student's name and then he continued everyone knows that there are too many ranks on the ranking chart right previous Scholars studied and concluded that it is a protective mechanism to prevent witnessing too great a gap causing people to feel despair he paused for a moment as if recalling something moreover this also creates confusion in determining the world's rank limit how high the maximum level remains unclear Some predict it to be level 999 While others say it is level 9999 however as Scholars researched more deeply they fell deeper into despair eventually unable to Bear it and committing suicide after that no one dared to study or care about the limit of the world's ranks anymore he responded indeed in a world like this humans have to face all sorts of survival pressures if they have to confront the vast discrepancy headon it would would be insane not to just like me I only heard about level 300 before and my body was already trembling uncontrollably yeu continue to ask so principle what is the highest level that humans or beasts have achieved so far surely this is documented the principal replied the highest level that humans have ever known was achieved by the heroes from 150 years ago those who once saved Humanity in dire situations their levels all reach 500 according to ancient standards level 100 is equivalent to 1 second so they were referred to as level 5 Seconds y Wu exclaimed in Surprise level 500 oh my are these still humans could it be that only these five people could stabilize the world This truly is top secret information that I have never heard before he continued to plead principal I want to know more please tell me further the principal nodded and explained after the major corporations led by the three great Heroes defeated the beasts and stabilized the balance of the earth they divided and built five large safe zones across the country from these five large zones after at least 100 Years of development many medium and small safe zones have been established the Southwest safety zone where we are currently located was built based on the foundation of the Southwest security Zone being situated in a relatively safe inland area over a 100 years there have been almost no highlevel monsters infiltrating the principal continued in addition to the necessary manpower to build the safe Zone there is the most important factor the super concentrated liquid magic Crystal this is the ultimate liquid energy source extremely rare hidden deep within the Earth it serves as Bol the foundation for constructing the safe Zone and the true reason for the continuous incursions of beasts over the past Century someone remarked I never expected that such a great secret was buried beneath the safe Zone ultimately liquid energy does it have similar properties to fossil fuels in ancient times the principal nodded that's right I remember reading in a history book that people in ancient times often waged Wars over this type of raw fossil fuel back then having energy meant having everything but what about the beasts he continued the super concentrated liquid magic Crystal was discovered by five great Heroes despite over a hundred years of research Humanity has only managed to harness its super icial effects as an extremely powerful energy source however for the beasts its effects are far greater than we can imagine therefore even if we cannot fully exploit it we absolutely must not allow the beasts to obtain it otherwise the consequences would be utterly terrifying he pondered for a moment then asked as for why there has been a frequent influx of highlevel beasts recently I suspect that besides targeting the super concentrated liquid magic Crystal there is another reason such such as some energy source that has attracted them this is just my initial speculation yiu suddenly thought some kind of energy is attracting damn it isn't it talking about me since I awakened the Kingpin account system the level of the invading beasts has been continuously rising and that super concentrated liquid magic Crystal couldn't be the upgrade path that the bot mentioned before truly worth it Yi Wu took a deep breath and told himself now I need to focus on clearing out the remaining beasts in the safe Zone once I get through the immediate danger then I can think further about these two issues at this moment in safe Zone number one the headquarters received a new report Han Mo reported the level 180 Beast that appeared from the previously mentioned teleportation Talisman has been entirely eliminated all teleportation Talisman have been destroyed currently most of the beasts in the safe Zone have been eradicated the casualty rate among civilians and the extent of equipment damage are both lower than expected the one who accomplished all this is the captain of the royal battle team y woo someone in the meeting room exclaimed unable to hide their astonishment is the intelligence accurate are you sure you're not mistaken hanm nodded answering confidently even though our communication with the outside world has been cut off we established an intelligence relay station at the border of the barrier from the start this way even though Zone one lost contact with the outside world we could still exchange information face to face the intelligence is definitely accurate the head of the headquarters praised well done cut guy really has a good eye for people Yi Wu is truly a significant surprise with such strength it seems he really intends to overthrow Wong Jen and that's not just empty talk he continued these are all things you should do and it is also due to my wise decision that Yi Wu has the opportunity to showcase his skills well done y woo you have never disappointed me but you have helped me time and again saved me how should I repay this kindness suddenly a guard rushed in panicked to report chairman tyen chuong and Wang Jen have joined forces Gathering nearly 2,000 people and are preparing to launch an attack on us he exclaimed what 2,000 people our strategy along with the mo attack team only has about 200 people how could they have so many another person spoke up to coordinate the staff the troop deployments of the three major corporations in zone one are relatively transparent the movement of personnel is also strictly managed now with Guang Jang and Tian chuong suddenly appearing with so many people there is only one possibility they had planned this in advance and used some secret route to move their forces into Zone one a worried voice rang out could it be that when I warned you all to be careful of Wong Jen it was just about this she replied that's right this information was all gathered by y Wu through intelligence efforts but at that time I knew you all completely doubted its accuracy another person angrily gritted his teeth damn it now not only hang Jen but even tyen chuong is involved with the disadvantage in numbers we can only rely on quality to make up for it he said I will let moac team take the initiative striking them before they can react she replied you you can't act recklessly the enemy outnumbers Us by far even if Mo attack team could temporarily gain the upper hand the opponent will find a way to pin them down once the Special Forces team can't Retreat the headquarters here will be in danger he responded then what do you suggest she answered the current situation can only be stabilized temporarily we need to send someone to negotiate with the two corporations to buy time while waiting for external reinforcements he replied reinforcements from the outside do you mean you woo can we really put our fate in the hands of a kid she retorted I'll say it again he's not a kid he has killed World bosses twice and saved the people of the safe Zone multiple times he is a hero he said all right then I agree with keen's suggestion but the problem is in this critical situation who will go negotiate she said naturally it has to be the one who proposed this everyone was shocked what mokai looked at moai with concern and said no way Kai this is too dangerous are you insane in this hopeless situation why would you want to go and seek death yourself can't we just find someone else moai ignored his words simply smirking confidently this has to be me she continued changing to other people fundamentally cannot achieve the effect of prolonging time don't worry I've gone through a lot of life and death situations ready I have experience in dealing with them mo zun long remained deep in thought at the table slightly lowering his head pondering to himself has my child grown up to this extent ke thinking this he suddenly spoke up instructing then you should bring the moang team and all other combat forces to help you remember try to avoid direct conflict M quickly responded understood father M Kei standing aside had to swallow his anger and grd his teeth this kind of dangerous matter should have been entrusted to me yet you took the initiative to handle it yourself are you foolish K we have been competing for so long do not let yourself die at the hands of Outsiders outside the beasts were frantically looking for a way to escape complaining damn it we clearly came to torture them why are we the ones being tortured the teleportation Talisman is gone the leader has been killed where should we run to now suddenly a SL flash flew in causing the Beast to be taken down in the blink of an eye a twin witch quickly summarized the number of Beast remaining is 28 their positions have been marked and members have been sent to eliminate them avna followed up Master our Victory is assured y wo led the way ahead cheerfully saying well done the Beast situation in the safe zone is pretty much under control but there's one important matter related to fate that must be drawn to a perfect conclusion avna hearing Yu say this scratched her head in confusion Mission what is that Yu leisurely replied well you will understand sooner or later meanwhile at the entrance of the wall in safe zone 9 a vehicle was speeding down the road juang Fu was inside driving with a crazed and terrifying demeanor he shouted damn it the teleportation Talisman is destroyed the beasts have been wiped out is Yu even human my combat power seems to have been completely destroyed I can't stay in this southwest safety zone anymore gu Fu day continue to mutter to himself even if y Wu doesn't come looking for trouble with me my brother will definitely come after me because of my plot against him I must go to the secret base in the wilderness to avoid the storm after yiu deals with my brother I will quietly return to Counterattack suddenly a girl jumped down from the top of the car cutting off Wang Fu's train of thought she smashed the car window causing him to startle in fear what is this who are you Guan Fu shouted his eyes filled with surprise as he recognized the face in front of him aure eight the girl said nothing quickly stepping onto the car's roof before jumping down the car lost control rolled back and crashed into a tree exploding violently ju Fu de roared in Anger you damn it why are you here he kicked the car door open stepping out with a furious expression shouting loudly what you want suddenly appearing and scaring me like this not seeing the girl respond Juan fuig gritted his teeth changing his tone what about kidy woo did you kill him more he stopped when he realized the girl was still standing silently her gaze full of challenge he took out the control button frantically pressing it is that so do you think you have a chance to fight against me this time I will erase your personality and emotions you will completely become my toy and killing tool AER 8 smiled faintly slowly drawing out a sharp sword what are you smiling about Huang Fu stammered as he saw her cold gaze H how is this possible he shouted in astonishment why are you not under control this can't be the controller can't be broken what what is going on the girl did not answer the sword in her hand gleaming with a cold light preparing to end him AER eight did not give hang Fu to a chance to say more she directly thrust her sword forward piercing through his hand and firmly embedding it into the ground Juan Fu pain cursed ouch a what the hell do you want to do agerate she stared at him coldly and said of course I want to kill you but don't worry I won't end your life right away I will slowly torture you making you suffer to the point of wanting to die an intense Aura of killing intent radiated from azerate causing Guang fui to feel a sense of Terror he inwardly thought damn it has the control period over her ended at first to avoid her excessive consumption I set a time limit now it seems I shouldn't have been so merciful but no matter I can just control her again suppressing the pain ju fuby used his other hand to pull the sword out of the hand that had been pierced grinning his teeth in agony he said how dare you lay a hand on your master just wait and see how I handle you his whole body trembled sweat pouring down heavily he shouted he ouch why hasn't the feeling of paying stopped yet ader 8 looked at him with a gloy gaze a faint smile on her lips because my magic has disrupted your simulation system if I am your highest Masterpiece then I will naturally use human techniques on my own body disturbing the system is truly too simple Can you feel it this bone deep suffering but even so it is still not enough Never Enough all the pain I have endured will be returned to you a 100,000 times over as soon as she finished speaking The Sword in Azure Eight's hand plunged deeper into his palm he screamed in agony ah it hurts why azer at bent down her gaze icy as she replied because I have truly gained my freedom Guang Fu was in excruciating pain his eyes rolling back the corners of his eyes welling with tears his body soaked with sweat he gritted his teeth and growled could it be ye woo did he lift the control over you impossible the control implants have fully fused into your body it is absolutely impossible to completely lift it without destroying the body Azure eight raised her head her face clearly showing a deep-seated hatred yet she maintained her calm demeanor looking at him and saying so you completely do not understand ywu he is a boy who can turn Decay into Miracles even your positioning coordinates were provided to me by him otherwise how could I have found you so easily Juan fui exclaimed in horror what damn it why didn't I discover his power earlier why could someone so strong not be utilized by me he lamented his voice full of bitterness if I had his help I would have long since dominated the entire Southwest safety zone damn it ader a approached looking down from above her tone cold you are mistaken yiu does not belong to anyone he only belongs to himself after after finishing her words she lifted her foot preparing to stomp on Wang Fu day Wang Fu day in panic quickly said no don't wait we can talk there's still a way back his screens were cut off as his entire body began to freeze in the final moments before the ice completely enveloped him he angrily cursed even if I die you won't Escape Wang Jang will never forgive you AER 8 replied leisurely her tone indifferent don't worry soon hang Jen will meet the same fate as you as Wang Fu de's entire body was completely encased in ice haer 8 coldly delivered a powerful kick shattering the ice into pieces she looked at the fragments Whispering goodbye to my past and to this Dan Mission the system announced you have received 1 million experience points and 5 million coins the secret treasury key is located in the huling area with enormous assets to support its reemergence Azure a held the key in his hand looked up at the Blue Sky and thought it's true yiu does not belong to anyone so he will not belong to me either I just want to help him be happy that is enough moreover this key will definitely make him very happy at Zone one in front of the handm mo group M naai stood with her hands on her hips and said this is really too ostentatious Uncle Wong Hu fuang stood above disdainfully saying Han Mo actually sent a girl to negotiate behind him is a tank with many soldiers lined up neatly ready to await combat orders hang fuang at level 100 frowned and spoke where is Han Mo long where is Han key the men of your Mo family are all turtleneck are they ding Jen Tien at level 95 Stood Beside him staring intently at MIM and said haha the men of the mo family have been cowardly like this for a long time Moi crossed her arms and looked straight at him seriously saying since the negotiation was proposed by me I should be the one to represent and speaking of this small matter I can handle it alone no need to trouble brother and father Guang fuang smirked and said no wonder you are her daughter you resemble her a lot from back then bold and with vision he paused briefly his expression shifting slightly when mentioning mne's mother if your mother were still alive but one holding hand Mo now should be her because hanmo is the territory she built Such a Pity mim's gaze flashed with killing intent she said in a deep voice no need to bring up Family Matters let's get straight to the point State your conditions hang fuang raised his hand holding the cigarette and pointed at Mimi saying refreshing among the nine districts of the southwestern region right now your handm is holding five districts 1 3 5 8 and nine my condition is to give districts one three and five to hang Jang District 8 to tan Chang that way I will kindly allow you to keep one life you can drag out a bit of your last breath in District 9 so that you won't end up entirely defeated in battle Juan how hearing this became angry and scolded this kind of condition can no longer be described with the Lion's bite martial arts Lulu spoke up to remind silence now is not the time for comments G1 also chimed in our mission is to protect the Miss there is no need to do unnecessary things at this moment someone ran over and whispered into H Fang's ear Vice chairman Vice chairman it's him he immediately startled widen his eyes and then covered his face laughing hardly haha even though standing behind him must be confused WS CEO Wang what happened to you Guang fuang tilted his head back to stop the tears flowing from his eyes and then sent with a laugh my foolish younger brother I already advised you long ago not to waste your thoughts on the techniques of the great Masters you just wouldn't listen and now you've indeed perished at the hands of the very thing you created how humiliating he spoke as he laughed and cried you bastard how could you die before me we said we would dominate the Southwest together to fight fiercely you damn it didn't keep your promise brother after a moment he wiped away his tears and said calmly you're gone and in this world I have nothing left to care about let me carry on your part to achieve our Ambitions suddenly he was engulfed in a blaze of Fury clenched his fists and shouted loudly I've changed my mind I want all of your assets all of your lives moai was taken aback Juan F day is dead Juan how quickly stepped in front of her frowning and saying is this Guang fuang crazy suddenly G Wang Chuan stepped forward bowed slightly and whispered please miss step back we'll handle this at that moment Moi was using the communication system to report to m n the news he just received left her stunned Wang Fu day while fleeing to the Wasteland was killed by a woman through the camera verification it was confirmed that the person was suoi a student from the same school as Yi Wu mim's face darkened she resentfully thought to herself could this possibly be a good thing that that brat did hearing mokai explain the current situation Moi n couldn't help but be shocked clearly weed had just gone through a fierce battle with the world boss and yet in such a short time he has eliminated the second in command of Wong Jen she gritted her teeth and thought no wonder he is who he is he's bringing us a huge headache Moi continued his voice anxious right now gu fuang has exploded with rage the delay tactic you are using can no longer be applied in my opinion you should quickly Retreat to the headquarters allowing the hand Mo team to buy us a bit more time M naai washed as vuan Fu shang's Army approached in his mind he quickly thought no matter how fast I run inside the building it won't be of any help in the current situation once the battle begins even the mo attack team cannot make up for the overwhelming difference in numbers ding xenan raised his wooden sword High and excitedly said haha this is how the general should be we all need to negotiate with them all using Force to suppress them is the most convenient method deploy the elite troops to capture the mo attack team and the rest go and capture M for me he laughed loudly but before he could finish unexpectedly from behind a sharp sword pierced through him in pain he screamed ah how could this happen huan fuang stepped forward coldly saying it seems you have misunderstood something I want to take everything of course including your tyen chuong ding Jin tan trembled horrified and stammering you you actually betrayed me Guang fuang pulled the sword out bent down to look at him and sneered betrayal no that's not it you were just a pawn in my hands the relationship between you and me is merely one of squeezing value where is the Betrayal don't worry I will take good care of tyang for you rest now at this point ding xenan collapsed the system immediately announced ding xenan level 95 Health 0% life index 0% hang fuang pointed his sword at the group of M commanding eliminate hanmo for me today is not only the end of hanmo but also the day Wang Jang under go Nirvana rebirth the troops began to fire continuously and the entire Army quickly charge forward everyone was excitedly saying charge take down Han Mo in one go then we can do whatever we want haha wipe out Han Mo gwan Chuan quickly ordered Yin Juan quickly protect miss the rest follow me to face the enemy he slashed down with his blade splitting the enemy's Gun Barrel in two those following him quickly received their orders yinan hearing the command step forward to protect moai behind him Miss please do not leave my side Moki n stood with her arms crossed calmly saying all right but in reality she was worried inside the situation has suddenly become more difficult under the current conditions of equal resource Supply fighting one-on-one relies on numbers can we hold out until Yu's reinforcements arrive at this moment hang fuang glanced back and said without Mr ding what is your choice do you intend to continue opposing us or what the squad leader of the first team of the new owner of our Genesis team belonging to the Tian chuang group hu level 120 respectfully bowed and said of course I choose to join you I have long been irritated by ding xention that old man washed up and out of touch refuses to step aside as long as he doesn't die how can Ty chuang ever hope to Rise Again from now on so D you were the new Master of the new owner of our Genesis team Vang fuang laugh hardly haha well said now let's see how you demonstrate your loyalty hu quickly LED his team forward naturally loyalty must be demonstrated through action G Wang Chuan jumped up and ordered guard this elevator door no one is allowed to enter Juan how while punching an enemy in the face responded quickly understood who would have thought that after so many battles we end up reverting to Classic tactics using the terrain to weaken the enemy's numerical Advantage from behind G Wang chewan a voice rang out what's so great about bullying weaklings come here and fight me G Wang Chuan turned in surprise to look at the source of the sword energy this sword energy is he quickly turned around blocking a sword strip from hu hu looked at him smirking as he asked long time no see Chia chew and chewan your rank has increased again could it be because of the previous team he bared his teeth in a smile showing disdain as he said haha I really admire the rich kids you guys have such an advantage in resources G1 Chun frowned at him coldly saying hu a dog that sells out its Master for Glory like you wouldn't have an advantage in resources either at that moment another sword struck towards them whooosh ji Wang Chuan quickly blocked this strike clang the man who attacked laughed and said oh it's been ages since I've seen two brothers sparring and mocking each other like this hasn't it G1 Chun calmly replied Aaron weren't you locked up in the Tomb I didn't expect you to have set up an ambush here early Aaron slung his sword over his shoulder and laughed hardly you know brother everything about you is good but you're just too stubborn Shia chew and chewan at this point why think so rigidly what's important is to have a good fight hu spoke up so how are we going to fight next Aaron although I don't want to admit it to defeat shiao Chuan Chuan we will lead to join forces Aaron feeling frustrated said who said we have to defeat him I just want to throw away our identities and kill Hai together with him don't disturb our little world anymore sha f f gwan Chu and stood silently on this side watching them Vine to fight against him luu quickly moved to another place then I won't disturb the two of you anymore but G Wang Chun blocked him and frowned did I agree to let you go in his heart he'd understood I have to hold them back buying as much time as possible for the rear Aaron angry stepped forward with a blade I said it's just the two of us if you let your guard down G Chu and immediately turned around blocking the blade that was thrusting towards him Aaron continued Youk be attacked by me taking advantage of that GW Chun thought anxiously I'm already frustrated if I get held back by Aaron the rear will be in danger everyone must hold on there at least until reinforcements arrive I can't believe I'm even relying on that kid's reinforcements a chaotic scene broke out surrounded by loud explosions mixed with the shouts of Wong jang's troops if we wipe out all of hanm Mo's men we can step onto the peak of our lives haha at the foot of the city wall the standoff between the two factions became tense on one side were the handm forces holding their ground desperately trying to execute their plans on the other side was the Furious attacking force of Wan how he had just taken down five or six people in one go and shouted damn it no matter how many I kill why is it never enough no matter how many times I defeat them as long as I don't wipe them out completely they will keep getting back up his supporter behind him replied there's nothing more to be done this is a one-on-one struggle Lulu Stood Beside him firing continuously with dual guns chuckling as she spoke boom don't get agitated killing isn't the main goal the important thing is to buy time skills and health packs need to be conserved in another Corner the purple-haired guy dashed across the battlefield quickly eliminating a series of soldiers gritting his teeth he growled I don't care about you hurry up and die the Flies of Wong Jang and Tian chuong just die already for me Yin huan stood in front of Moki continuously slashing at the approaching enemies she said seriously Miss you better go back to the headquarters building it's too dangerous to stay here we're about to collapse up front I have to go up to provide backup MIM May steadfastly standing behind retorted a bunch of useless people whether I Retreat or not won't solve anything moreover you can't go either you've missed your chance to grow before and have fallen behind them going up there is just asking to die gin Ruan was both slaughtering and saying no wonder you are a my your words are as sour as ever though harsh to hear they are the truth however I will absolutely not be afraid to Face Reality because of this Gap moai looked up at the barrier gay above and said we are not avoiding reality we must be patient to preserve Our Lives patiently waiting I am sure he will surely come Yin muan looked in the direction moai was pointing are you saying fat hu came charging up from behind cheerfully saying ha I found a treasure how could that prick be so generous to leave such great Merit for me I must thank him when I return Miss Mo I'll take your life okay Yin huan quickly blocked one of his strikes hu excitedly said oh the stunning Yin Juan is also here but with your level here you can only serve as a pawn Yin Juan's Health was currently at 80% but she quickly responded even if I die I must stop you from harming shiai hu smiled and swam another strike down at her then I won't hold back any longer I hope you could help me give me one minute gin huan used all of her strength to block his sword with hers she coughed up blood with only 50% of her health remaining her body severely injured out of breath she coughed again and M hurriedly stepped forward to support her Yin Juan you must run forget about me you are more important to the company than I am you still have limited potential for growth dying like this would be too regrettable Yin Juan pushed m n into the building causing her to be astonished exclaiming what are you doing Yin hun gritted her teeth and coldly replied are you joking are these the words meant to be said to a toou surely I still can't bring myself to like you miss Moi NE cried out in despair Yin huan the door immediately slammed shut with a loud clang Yin huan stood fac ing hu telling herself a tool is meant to be used and then discarded right but if she dies the young Master will be heartbroken he would be very sad therefore I will not let that happen yinhuan held the dazzling gem in her hand and instantly crushed it boom let me summon all my strength to await the hero's arrival she raised her head high a determined resolve a light burst forth from the gem body of the Heavenly demon the notification system the body of the Heavenly demon can be upgraded to level 120 maintaining for 1 minute after which it falls into a weakened State the fierce battle that just occurred had destroyed everything the dead lay scattered among the ruins dust and smoke filling the air yinan covered in injuries struggled to sit up against her sword she gasped for breath her current health at only 15% her life index at zero vuf stood arrogantly looking at her with a challenging gaze he smirked and said I didn't expect you to have such a killing move truly fascinating but just 1 minute is really too short I haven't had enough fun yet at this moment hu's Health was still at 50% his life index at 60% he was excited his eyes blazing swinging his sword fiercely towards Yin voan as he struck he said what a Pity if it weren't for the fact that I need proof of loyalty right now I would definitely keep you as a toy but today you must die just then a clang rang out another sword suddenly appeared blocking hu attack the one who intervened was ji Wang Chuan the two swords clashed the sound of the impact echoing loudly but ji Wang Chuan was not in a better State either his health was only at 8% his life index at zero behind him were Juan how and leya working together Juan how had only 5% Health left while leya had even less at just 4% both were in a stateof life index at zero like sing stood at the back supporting everyone his health bar was only at 3% and his life index was already at zero finally there was danlu tightly holding Yin bu in his arms shooing her Dan L's health bar was at 5% and like like sing his life index was also at zero hu slung his sword over his shoulder and upon seeing them like this he laughed mockingly hey hey hey the mo attack team that has always been so high and mighty has now become so disheveled I can now single-handedly kill your entire team haha Huang fuang and his troops had also arrived hearing this he gritted his teeth and shouted that's enough hu he stood with his arms crossed looking at jiwang Chu's group coldly stating no wonder you are the leader of the mo attack team relying on just a few people to kill over 1,000 of mine but it ends here your only chance of survival is to join us Wang Jen what do you say I am a man who values talent and will not treat you poorly ji Wang Chun looked at the others firmly declaring the words surrender have never been in my dictionary you don't need to waste your breath here if you want to fight then let's fight I'll accompany you to the death hin fuang looked at the people before him frowning and thinking to himself indeed you all have done your best but this is neither a game fight nor a one-on-one duel this is a grand battle between teams or guilds personal strength no matter how powerful cannot withstand the disparity in resources and numbers why insist on doing something so foolish Shou Chuan Chuan don't let your stubbornness harm yourself living in humiliation is better than Dying With Honor at this moment mod Zan long and his two sons stepped forward he spoke in a solemn voice stop it all that's enough this battle need not continue any further everyone was astonished shouting in unison deputy chief both the young master and the young lady everyone ju fuang saw them his eyes filled with excitement and loudly proclaimed so you finally dare to show yourselves hi zun long I thought you would hide away forever Mo zun long replied his tone cold ju Fen I can accept your conditions power is fine assets are fine take whatever you want but I hope you will spare my people a way to live your goal has been achieved there is no need to create additional unnecessary sacrifices hin fuang looked at him rage burning in his eyes and sneered oh with your character I thought you would fight to the death he continued why did you suddenly change your personality are you starting to have a heart for the lives of the tools under your command this is not the moan long I know moan long remains silent upon hearing this without saying a word he remembered half an hour ago when he had been shocked to exclaim after hearing moki's intention what did you say you want to sacrifice your life to exchange for the mo attack team M9 looked at her father seriously and replied with Wang Fu xen's tactics if he doesn't wipe out all of our people he won't stop if sacrificing my life can exchange for the mo attack team and some time then it's absolutely worth it Moi felt Furious upon hearing this he stepped forward grabbed his sister and shouted stop this nonsense this is not an exchange it's a sacrifice you can't go moai looked up at her brother in Surprise she hesitated and said M Kei you she emotionally lifted her hands grasping his hands which were resting on her shoulders her eyes glistened with tears and she joyfully said I know although you often oppose me deep down you have never abandoned me those harsh words on the outside are merely a protective shell that you have to to show it's to protect the company and also to protect me right brother M Kei trembled all over looking at his younger sister soing what are you talking about I never the one who received all of Mother's Love since childhood like you hi I have always hated the most M tightly hugged her brother softly saying I know I always known brother mokai embraced his sister tightly closing his eyes sobbing with each word huh huh seeing the two siblings like this Moen long stood up his face darkened saying the one who should apologize is father as the leader of the corporation father has long discarded personal weak emotions he regretfully continued seeing you two siblings always fighting against each other father has remained indifferent in fact father even supported this opposition thinking it would benefit the future of the company but he stepped forward embracing both of his children gently saying why must a person step into the boundary of life and death to awaken to realize what is most important to oneself I'm sorry KY ke me the two hugged him both choked up calling father moan long made a firm decision strongly saying let's go we will go outside together if we want to gamble then let's stake the entire future of the mo family let's bet whether that last hope can come true or not the brothers all nod Ed in agreement Mo zun long turned back to the present looked at Guang fuang and said I give everything up exiling the entire Mo family to the Wilderness is that satisfactory V fuang heard this sneered and then refused that's not enough you have oppressed me for decades this resentment cannot be erased by just exiling you Mo zun patiently asked again then what do you want Juan Fu shang's face became cunning he smirked and stated his condition this haha I have long heard that the beauty of Yin Juan from the mo attack team is stunning I really want to see her true face my subordinates who have fought with her are already exhausted let M and Yin Ruan strip and dance a dance to entertain my soldiers if you can do that I will spare your lives hearing that despicable request Moi was Furious and wanted to charge forward he shouted madly what ju fuen if you want to kill then kill but to humiliate my sister and my subordinates I will fight you mokai stood beside him her face darkened she reached out to pull her brother back and calmly said it's okay brother as long as it can help everyone survive what is this little sacrifice she lowered her voice and said to mokai yet although Wan fuang intends to humiliate us before killing us this also gives us a little more time in the end mok's face turned pale and he weakly replied I know Wan how was so angry that he gritted his teeth punched the ground hard and shouted furiously Dan it it's all because we are too weak that we have caused the young lady and Yin Juan to suffer this humiliation damn it gwang Chun stood in front bracing himself and holding back he darkened his face and ordered everyone close your eyes remember this humiliation in your hearts Moi n stepped in front of Yin Juan and gently asked Yin Juan are you scared Yin Juan raised her hand and took off her mask she gently replied how could I be when the mask was removed Yin manan's beautiful face was revealed she smiled brightly and said it is a great honor to fight side by side with the young lady until the very last moment everyone was astonished by her beauty the crowd excitedly cheered wow her beauty is indeed legendary the group of Wong Jang excitedly shouted in unison take it off take it off they surrounded moai and Yin Juan jostling each other get out of the way I want to see wow Suddenly at that moment a terrifying Force pierced through the barrier producing a loud explosion from the sky a group of people was stunned and in an uproar one person shouted look the barrier has broken there's a large hole something is coming here a powerful be team of light shop forward Landing right at the center the impact sent hang Jang soldiers who were surrounding the scene flying they screamed in panic ah who is it as the dust settled the figure of Yi Wu emerged he stood tall holding MAA and Yin Juan with both hands he smiled and said sorry I'm late mokai looked up at ywo her eyes shining brightly joyfully exclaiming you finally came I always believe you would definitely show up Yi Wu awkwardly replied I'm sorry for being late I had to handle some matters I'm just glad you're okay if not I really couldn't forgive myself after saying that he turned to inquire about Yin B it's been a while since we last met your injuries don't seem light it looks like you've been through a tough battle I'm sorry for putting you through this Yin huan blushed shilly responding I I'm fine there's no need to worry inside she felt flustered and thought where is my mask I'm not prepared for this I shouldn't have thought twice before acting like a sleigh the mo family members were Overjoyed at Yu's appearance Juan how clenched his fists and laughed hardly haha it looks like this kiddo is taking the stage once again Leia also chimed in the opportunity to get on this stage has been stuck for too long Moi frowned upon seeing Yi Wu appear anxiously calling his name y woo Wang fuang raised an eybrow at y Wu sneering kiddo you are y Wu right to be able to break this legendary level barrier truly amazes me you really are the high value Target of our Huang Jen but now in terms of numbers and Firepower I have an absolute Advantage just relying on you alone cannot change the outcome y wo upon hearing this showed no worry he raised his hand to point at the sky smiling as he said oh but when did I say I would come alone immediately from afar the silhouette of the new equipment is the bionic girl Legion appeared they were swiftly flying over the people present turned to follow yiwu's pointing hand when they clearly saw this Legion armed with new equipment at the magic Crystal level 160 dropped from the boss along with overwhelming Firepower and formidable strength everyone gasped and exclaimed that that is level 160 the new equipment is the bionic girl Legion landed on the ground then split up to take action they began to slay and simultaneously follow the orders of their Master now start the combat to eliminate the people of Wong Jen were immediately beaten to a pulp hanm Mo's group also sees this opportunity to charge forward charge for me we must make Wang Jang pay the price saou also charged forward shouting loudly all troops attack leave no one alive from bang Jang and Tian chuang Wang fuang saw the situation suddenly turn upside down in the blink of an eye panicking as he stuttered what what is happening just a moment ago I had the upper hand and now in an instant Aaron rushed up blocking Guang fuang and slicing through a bullet that was flying towards them he yelled boss we need to retreat the situation has completely turned if we don't leave now it will be too late H fuen unwilling to accept this fate angry shouted I absolutely will not give up this hard one opportunity call Hui and the others here before he could finish Aaron interrupted senior are you still counting on them hu has already LED his people to flee hang fuen was taken a upon hearing this shouting what meanwhile Hui and his group were fleeing at high speed to escape one member of the group hesly asked KU boss are we really leaving like this first betraying and chuang and then betraying Guang Jang isn't that too ungrateful hu ran ahead calmly replied then what should we do clearly Wang Jang has lost and wam Fu Shang has no chance left besides ye Woo is also there if the Intel is correct this kid is even more terrifying than ji Wong Chun if we don't leave we'll end up as dust H fuen upon hearing that Yi and his group had fled became infuriated he constantly cursed and called them useless trash he shouted loudly trash where is Ling Yan hurry up and call her to lead the troops for support and what about Wang Fu de people even if he dies he still has a large amount of armed forces at his disposal call all of them over here to assist Yu stepped forward looked at Huang fuang with a scornful gaze and said support it's gone there's no more support left I'm late because I took some time to wipe out all the remaining forces of hang Jang from Zone 2 to 9 Wang fuen was stunned and yelled what YW continued mockingly moreover Len Yuan has been under control for a long time if not why has she not appeared during this whole Affair and as for Huang Fu I've also dealt with him not only that but I am the one who spread the rumors online that cause your stocks to crash from the start I am also the one who sabotaged the Munitions Depot in the major areas of Wong Jang at this this point yiu was pleased and ridiculed Wang fuen asking how is it surprised stunned H fusen upon hearing this was utterly Furious he drove his sword and charged madly at Yu shouting so it's you you killed my brothers and destroyed the career I built over decades to have everything ruined by a kiddo like you this is something I absolutely cannot accept H fuang swung his sword towards y Wu who summoned a seal barrier in front of him from within the seal an armored arm extended out and crushed his sword y woo coldly mocked is this the leader of the Huang Jen group I thought you could show a bit more composure I didn't expect you to lack the courage to face reality no wonder you ended up losing so badly as soon as he finished speaking y Wu deliver another devastating punch Juan fuang was sent reeling spitting out blood clutching his abdomen as he slid back coughing violently this Blow from Yi Wu had reduced his blood volume to about 3% Yi Wu looked at Guang fuang who was collapsed on the ground continuously coughing up blood he turned and walked away dispassionately saying I'm not interested in killing you I'll leave your handling to the mo family hang fuang sat on the ground clutching his chest watching y Wu's departing figure unwilling to accept his fate he coughed cough cough handle me what kind of joke is that as soon as he finished he suddenly summoned a sword and lunged to attack Yu from behind he shouted I am the one who will dominate all the safe zones how can I die here the one who must die is y Wu continue walking forward not even bothering to turn back at his words he merely sighed at that moment yinon charged in and slashed a sword through vanan fen's body ending his life coldly stating the one who must die is you that's right hen fuen collapsed to the ground trembling as he turned his head back gasping and questioning Aaron why didn't you protect me how could this happen I refuse to accept it Aaron replied calmly Sorry boss your influence has faded away our hiring relationship no longer requires my intervention after dealing the Fatal blow the Wang fuang Yin Juan's body also fell into a state of weakness she staggered and then collapsed Yu hurriedly caught Yin Juan and asked why did you rush out all of a sudden you know he couldn't harm me Yin W fell into Yu's Embrace weakly smiling haha usually I'm the one being robbed by you today I guess I've robbed something for once Yu looked at her gently saying all right then I'll give you this one time but you've already won seeing that Juan fuen was dead Mo Zen long stepped forward and addressed hang Fu xen's subordinates H fu is dead there's no need to continue fighting I Mo Zen long can guarantee your safety Moi standing behind him also spoke up as long as you agree to join the handm mo group I assure you your treatment will be better than before those who do not wish to join can drop their weapons and leave on their own we will not make things difficult for you upon hearing this Wong Jen's followers all collectively dropped their weapons and bowed their heads in surrender thank you Mo un long for sparing Our Lives we surrender ji wangchu stepped forward with his sword and said to Aaron Aaron you should also put down your weapon stop resisting in vain at that moment Aaron was squatting beside the corpse of hang fuang hearing this he looked up at ji Wang Chuan and replied calmly of course I had already put down my weapon those without capability should not Harbor Ambitions living another day is worth it isn't it Shout chewan chewan after the battle ended the father and suu Moen long and Moi approached Yi Wu Moen long said Le woo this time you have made a significant contribution if it weren't for your intervention I would have faced a great disaster today Moi also bowed respectfully and said you not only saved the hanm mo group but also our family I'm Moi am deeply grateful and also apologize for my previous disrespectful Behavior yugu replied cheerfully you two are exaggerating the young lady has helped me I should repay her moreover I am one of hanm Mo when the group is in danger it's only natural to lend the helping hand regarding the reward we can discuss it later the Mong team of the hanmo group having witnessed the incident gathered to discuss like sing set cross layed hands clasped over a pile of De Brite and said today's situation seemed really dangerous but he handled it with ease truly impressive we are still at the first level of this wave while he is already at the atmospheric level leya stood below and said there's no need to talk much about anything else I only have one word admire to express my feelings towards him he is truly outstanding Juan how sitting in front also exclaimed cheerfully Yi Wu has really used his individual strength to turn the situation around this time he has completely surpassed us if we don't work hard we will be left Far Behind by him danl standing nearby agreed that's right we must strive harder otherwise very soon the title of the number one team will belong to the king team gwang Chuan arms crossed said seriously Yi Wu is truly strong his abilities have proven everything no matter how high his status is he has always maintained his original Essence but just watching someone else's back as they move forward is not the style of the Mong team next everyone prepared for my special training everyone shouted in unison yes captain moai and Yin Juan silently stood by and watched moai thought shilly this time yiu has gained Fame again the Gap in status between us seems to be closing but the beautiful women by his side are numerous as clouds I wonder what he's thinking in his heart Yin huan was also deep in thought feeling heavy-hearted this time he has achieved great Merit I should be happy but why does my heart feel a little tight am I afraid that he is getting further away from me gin Ruan was lost in thought when moai suddenly asked what are you thinking so intently about could it be that you've also been Enchanted by yiu Yin Juan flustered waved her hands and said no no it's nothing at all young lady please don't joke like that Moi mischievously laughed intentionally teasing causing Yin Juan to blush in embarrassment the next day in the city Yu stood high above looking down within Just One Day the city had completely recovered from the injuries of war the operational efficiency of the hanm grou truly commanded admiration I Vis standing next to him remarked this is nothing extraordinary if we use the Master's abilities combined with the new equipment the bionic girl Legion the efficiency would be even higher however the Clone bionic technology is an ancient secret technique that is sensitive we should avoid attracting too much attention moreover I still have other matters to ask for their assistance you looked over at I Vis and asked AV Vis do I currently have enough funds to initiate the construction of the first phase of the base enough I Vis replied along with the rewards from hm Mo today we need not worry about financial issues anymore Yu nodded indeed this reward comes at just the right time early this morning at hanos Corporation MO Z long gathered everyone together to commend Yu after the recent great battle the two major corporations Ty and chuang and Wong Jang had been eliminated hanmo would take over all their territories Industries thereby unifying the Southwest safe Zone while also building the xon safe Zone into a more prosperous major safe area Moen long said the resounding success we have today is primarily due to the brightest star of hanm Mo Yi Wu the reward for him in addition to the previously determined dungeon key will be an additional 500 million 10% of the corporation shares from now on ymu will be the fourth major shareholder of hanmo only behind me Moi and moai hearing Mo zun Long's announcement everyone below cheer enthusiastically according to the company's budget the current 10% of shares is valued at around 1 billion this is truly a remarkable turning point for yi wo a sum of money that many people would not earn in their lifetime after the ceremony ended Aaron said to Yu after the team discussed we decided that the 200 million you borrowed will no longer need to be repaid first you saved Our Lives second without you in the battle the losses would have been much heavier thank you Captain returning to that evening ad Vis said to him although money is not an issue right now we are still lacking an important ingredient which is a map mainly we are missing the center of the structure the defense system and the AR architectural style he replied that doesn't matter now I am a shareholder of the hanmo group with the authority to mobilized the highest resources hanm Mo has now taken over both tyen chuang and Wong Jang I have already instructed someone to handle those Maps Yu turned back to look at the Legion of young women and said at that time the supervision of the construction will be entrusted to you the Legion of young women eagerly replied in unison we will definitely complete our master's Mission well he nodded and added it's best to hide you in the dungeon having you outside will attract too much attention after that ye wo entered the transformation space to assess the situation the construction work had progressed steadily he asked the system system how many levels can my experience points currently raise the flame Emperor the system responded calculating master has 160 million experience points the flame Emperor can increase to level 200 he placed his hand on his chin and thought 160 million and can only increase 70 more levels in the past I didn't dare to increase to level 200 but since seeing the boss rise to level 300 I know that I need to work harder he continued to remind himself now I only have two ways to challenge combining the skills of the Shadow King and twin witch but both consume a lot of resources I can't place all my hopes on those I need to find more Alternatives ye W thought for a a moment and then asked the system system what is the maximum level of the flame Emperor the system replied that the maximum level is 999 Yu was surprised level 999 higher than the S5 level of the human Heroes that the principal mentioned could this also be the limit of the World level hard to believe y Wu held his head tiredly sighing but knowing this limit is of what use now the important thing is to level up now I have two choices one is to force the flame Emperor to find a way to raise it to level 999 the other is to unlock a new account maybe I will be luckier But whichever way I choose I have to earn more experience points Yu continued to think the higher the level the less experience points the dungeon in hanm Mo's hands is no longer useful it seems I have to find a higher level dungeon but where to find it now just when he was confused yiu suddenly remembered something wait when it comes to the Wilderness surely no one knows better than Mo way system open the map of the old world Relic distribution the system quickly displayed the map you looked at it and exclaimed the principal once said this map focuses on safe areas depicting the distribution of all relics and copies within a radius of 2,000 km with this Divine artifact why should I be afraid that I can't find a dungeon truly a treasure Yu looked at the map with excited eyes indeed in the past I didn't recognize its wonders let me finish organizing everything around here then I'll set off to find a dungeon right away while watching a movie yiu was suddenly called by the principal why is the principal calling me yiu answered the call the principal said V wo I apologize for bothering you at such a late hour yiu replied it's no problem principal I haven't slept yet what do you need to talk to me about the principal responded it's not an urgent matter I just wanted to ask if you are free to come to school tomorrow I have a few things I want to discuss with you y Wu nodded yes I will be there the principal ended the call looked out the window and murmured we are getting old there are some things we should rely on the younger generation for they are the ones with a bright future don't you think so Mo way beside him Muay also gazed at the night sky and thought the night sky is really beautiful tonight I wonder if Yun Fe and my father mother can see it once the Fortress is completed I have to bring them here system notification there are 6 days and 2 hours left until the shadow cane World forces the summoning the next morning just as agreed y Wu arrived at the school to meet the principal as soon as he got there he was surrounded by a group of students all looking at him with admiration wow there's gu woo the hero of our school he doesn't even realize it he's not only the hero of our school but also the great hero of the entire safe Zone Yu stood in the crowd feeling a bit overwhelmed he thought to himself if I had known this I would have flown straight to school once in the principal's office ye sat down and asked directly principal what did you want to see me about today the principal looked at Yu his voice awful why woo have you ever thought about leaving the safe Zone y wo heard the principal and surpr Ur rised asked what do you mean the principal replied seriously The Incredible strength you have displayed has convinced me that you should not be limited to the southwestern safe Zone among all the safe zones the southwestern zone is just average or low it's area population and overall strength are sufficient for ordinary residents to live but for a young man with your abilities it is truly a form of confinement causing you to lose the opportunity to reach Greater Heights the principal continued his eyes full of enthusiasm only harsh challenges can help you unleash your full potential you should soar higher to a broader sky where you can change the world Yu looked at him thinking to himself has the principal always been this passionate the principal sat down and said thoughtfully if we lived in peacetime I would only wish for you to live a peaceful life for eternity but this is an apocalyptic era a world full of dangers lurking everywhere Yi Wu nodded agreeing I think so to I am preparing to look for higher level dungeons based on senior mu map the principal looked at him and asked seriously good but that is still not enough have you ever thought about what you would do after becoming the strongest Yu replied his voice firm the driving force behind my desire to become stronger is to protect my family the stronger the enemy the stronger I will become than them but further things I haven't thought about they are too vague the principal stood up abruptly his gay Stern too far-fetched not at all I see this potential in you but even if you become the strongest you cannot break the limits of humanity this world will not change monsters will continue to appear wreaking havoc meanwhile humans will forever hide in safe zones after a brief pause he continued vwoo have you ever thought about restarting this world restarting the world y Wu exclaimed in astonishment repeating the question in the past a friend also mentioned this rumor to me but could it be true the principal nodded his voice growing solemn there are still some things that remain unclear nevertheless rumors are just rumors I cannot provide an answer right now however Moe once told us that we could change the world Yu furrowed his brow so what exactly has mowi discovered the principal took out an artifact and showed it to Yu this is it yiu stared wide-eyed is isn't this the black slate fragment that the legion dropped in the dungeon the principal focused intently on the item in his hand and recounted this is what Moi discovered when entering the ruins it is said that when he touched this slate a miracle occurred he felt as if his soul was leaving his body constantly traversing various Dimensions but the energy of the Slate quickly faded after that no matter how many times he tried that Miracle never reoccurred therefore no one believed him he continued but Mo way saw hope through that sleigh he believed that the current ERA of O is just a version of another world among countless spaces and Times of the earth as long as a certain condition is met we can change the outcome at that moment he had no more attachment to the safe Zone after handing over the map along with this slate to me he immediately ventured Into the Wilderness before leaving he left behind a sentence that I will always remember in order to end the apocalypse even if I only have a theoretical capability in hand and I will find a way to solve it since then I have never seen Mo again as of now I do not know whether he is alive or dead I only blame myself for not having enough courage and ability to venture Into the Wilderness with him nevertheless I truly hope he can find the path to restore the world yeu Listen to the principal recount this story pondering deeply I didn't expect that behind Mo story lies so much venturing Into the Wilderness alone to seek the path to end the apocalypse this courage is hard for anyone to match though it is quite admirable his ideals still seem too far-fetched at the very least it is not my current objective moreover the Mom battle team also once sought the Slate could this be related the inner circumstances must surely be known to them more deeply I need to find a way to listen in further the principal pointed at Yu and continued but you are not like that y wo not only do you possess great strength but you also have a kind heart you are young and your future is boundless right now you have become an important figure in the safe Zone saving the people from danger multiple times I believe that if it were you you would definitely be able to inherit Mo Way's will and find that glorious path yeu stood up and replied principal please don't say that I am not strong enough to save the people yet at present I only want to keep growing stronger it take my family to live in a safer place but if there comes a day when I am capable enough and when there are no more worries I agree to follow the principle and give it a try upon hearing this the principal stepped forward and placed a hand on his shoulder saying happily of course whether you agree or not is up to you no one can make such a significant decision for you I am also very glad to witness your growth every day I hope that in the future you will continue to maintain this Spirit not letting desires or Temptations shake you nor allowing hatred to Blind you and lead you to make wrong decisions Yu bowed his head and replied thank you principal for your kindness the student will certainly remember it deeply after their exchange Yu left the principal stood on the floor looking down at his figure thinking to himself just like Mo yiu has been very steadfast in his will I believe that as long as the conditions are right he will definitely bring about a new world while walking Li ji called guu I have brought back all the designs from the sky Tech with Wong Jen just as you predicted there are many promising opportunities in there do you have time to come to my research center now you replied great I'll head over right away soon after Yu arrived at the research center belonging to Li jasai upon arrival everyone here welcomed him cheerfully hello master yay hello Mr yay hello everyone you've all worked hard Yi Wu entered the research room and looked at the information beforehand with surprise you managed to process all of this in less than half a day the efficiency truly astonishes me lii smiled you don't have to be polite this is my job I will definitely find a way to complete it quickly immediately after you who called I Vis to check the efficiency AV Vis see if these highlevel designs meet the requirements Yes master I have a feeling that the designs we need to find must be among these I viz responded liasi curiously asked I just don't quite understand are you in such a hurry to find these because you are preparing for a new invention perhaps yiu thought for a moment and then decided to tell him liai is a trustworthy person it's no problem to share here's the thing Yu began to explain his intention to build a fortress upon hearing this liai was excited so that's it no wonder you had to get the key to the dungeon before it turns out it's to build the Fortress let me help you he said although my abilities are not as good as yours with Decades of experience I will surely come up with something interesting that's easy with you here the construction will be even smoother Yu replied after a moment of searching I Vis returned and reported Master we have found them all three missing design sheets have been recovered now we only need the starter materials for the construction hearing this Yi Wu turned to liai and said liai we have sufficient fun and Designs could I trouble you to help collect some additional materials Li C nodded and replied I will certainly do my best but I have a suggestion the construction of the Fortress cannot be rushed first we need to determine its basic framework to see how many materials are necessary from there we can optimize the leftover materials moreover during construction if additional functions or input are needed we can timely add appropriate materials ye W agreed then then we will proceed as you suggest once all the basic steps were completed Yi Wu took out a key and said finally the construction Endeavor begins in the new Zer Temple area in the main hall of the dungeon a subordinate of the majesty nelt and said Majesty this cannot be this is the world of our race how can we allow Outsiders to come and go as they please the Majesty exclaimed where do you see Outsiders Yu has saved us defeating the hero of almac without him would you even be standing here speaking so loudly at this moment Von nuts stepped in and said I do not trust this man he wants to build a steel base in our world which will definitely affect the environment I cannot bear to see our territory turned into a second alac another person chimed in that's right the world of the insect species must be governed by the insect species we cannot let Humanity run a mock their Majesty spoke up his voice full of a Authority Von nuts is a noble who has been exiled for many years not participating in the previous battle regarding Yu's contributions he is certainly still unclear and will naturally not be convinced however even if he is not convinced yiu is still the king of this world I cannot allow anyone to hinder Yu's plans suddenly a portal unexpectedly opened before them what is that why did it suddenly appear here from the portal yiu stepped out he looked around and then spoke ha are you all in a meeting sorry to interrupt why is there such a heavy oppressive feeling the insect species gradually appeared and upon seeing Yoo everyone showed a look of astonishment one person quietly said is that human Yu he is the one who defeated the ancient insect God indeed the oppressive feeling from him is truly terrifying but he has brought so many humans here this situation is really not good the insect speak rushed to surround y wo expressing flattery vwu we finally get to meet you we've heard your name for a long time thank you for saving the insect species you were the hero of our species y woo feeling somewhat shy from the compliments replied I can't accept the title of hero I'm just a good person with no ulterior motives baby beetles suddenly flew over and hugged y wo tightly V Woo you're finally back that means you successfully obtained the key to the dungeon right you're back to prepare for the construction of the weak point yiu nodded but his face showed a bit of embarrassment baby Beetle why have you become so tiny now baby Beetle scratched his head grinning foolishly and explained it's fine now I can freely change my form I've gotten used to maintaining this baby form when not fighting baby beetles mother also added an explanation the baby form of baby baby Beal can enhance absorption and minimize the consumption of evil magic this is the best training form when not in battle upon hearing the explanation Yi Wu finally understood so that's it however looking at the atmosphere of all of you the contrast seems quite Stark doesn't it yiwu's face displayed clear sadness and worry that's right as the new king I've just ascended the throne and haven't yet unified the internal opinions of the clan a noble God who was pre iously exiled has expressed opposition to the construction of your weak point however rest assured I can resolve this small matter immediately the female warriors beside him hearing this were Furious a mere insect species dares to obstruct our master's plans clearly our master has saved them yet they still dare to show such disrespect one Female warrior shouted loudly let us immediately flatten this dungeon and see who dares to oppose us upon he heing this those from the insect species were terrified and broke out in a sweat yiwu quickly spoke up to issue an order hey hey what are you doing there are no more enemies in this world put down your weapons right away the fenale Warriors immediately obeyed sheathing their weapons and stepping back meanwhile a baby Beetle witnessing it all could not stop expressing admiration indeed Yi Wu is deserving of his reputation in such a short time he has built such a power powerful regiment he is truly a shining example for me ye wo chuckled and addressed everyone I'm sorry for frightening you all regarding the construction of the stronghold I might have been a bit selfish and didn't consider the feelings of the locals but please believe me I have no ill intentions at all I just want to create a safe place for my family I hope we can all live together peacefully and maintain the beauty of this world hearing these words everyone in the insect species happily agreed one person said we absolutely trust ywu we hope everyone can support him as well another person added rest assured Overlord we will definitely assist in the construction of the stronghold while everyone was in agreement another group of the insect species vehemently oppose I don't believe it this faction and his minions clearly still want to kill us now this explanation sounds very fake I CD is inherently cunning and unpredictable wanting to take advantage of this opportunity to Vive for territory with our insect es he is indeed the second Oswald no doubt Humanity must not be trusted baby Beetle angrily pointed a finger at the group of insect individuals and said you repeatedly oppose me I see you as the second Oswald Von nuts was taken aback and responded I dare not it's just that the human yo is truly suspicious I'm acting this way solely for the world and future of our insect species upon hearing this baby beevil was Furious and didn't want to say anything more and enough the future of the insect species world is my responsibility it is not yet your turn to worry I have had enough of your opposing Behavior clearly you don't understand anything and still come out to protest baby Beetle coldly ordered someone take Von nuts and Exile him to the frontier lands once again for me Von nuts strugg and shouted let me go I can leave on my own then Von nuts also made a threat you keep being so stubborn the young king who sacrificed ices the Dignity of the insect species for Humanity will sooner or later face an increasing voice of opposition and when that time comes it will be my turn to be king baby Beetle spoke sternly reaffirming once again Yu is the savior of my insect species his words are my words if anyone dares to show disrespect to yiu from now on then the fate of glue will be the clearest lesson is everyone clear the crowd of the insect species shouted in unison loud and clear your majesty y woo seeing baby beetles handling of the situation praised him I haven't seen you in a few days you really carry the demeanor of a king now delighted by the compliment baby Beetle replied you're just teasing me I'm still far from it ever since I ascended to the throne I've come to understand the difficulties that my father had to face Yi Wu reassured him it's okay just take your time even among humans it can be hard to understand each other let alone between humans and the insect species would we truly make this world a better place opposition will naturally Fade Away someone interjected their tone full of warning Vu this matter cannot be delayed we need to start building the weak point immediately Yu inquired in your opinion where would be the most suitable place to build the man opened a virtual map examined it closely and then said from what I see we should build on the ruins of the collapsed Temple after the last battle that place is nothing but a desolate Wasteland now constructing a weak point there would not only allow us to utilize the energy source from the insect species heart lying beneath the Earth but it would also provide better protection for it Yu listened to the analysis and agreed let's do it like this the unmanned equipment team was quickly dispatched to the Lost temple ruins IIs was assigned the task of overseeing the overall progress the equipment team began analyzing and Reporting then used modern technology to Mark the space of the dungeon this method was indeed much more effective than using conventional robots the goal this time was to build the framework and foundation for the weak point area since this was the most critical part it required a lot of time the engineers were calculating in detail the amount of materials and the necessary Cycles to complete baby Beetle unable to contain its curiosity with bright eyes moved closer to observe it exclaimed the scientific techniques of humanity are truly amazing compared to this Advanced automated construction method the manual methods of our race are really too backward Yu smiled at this and replied we cannot say that manual construction methods are backward each method has its own advantages and disadvantages ultimately what results can come from the fusion of these two different civilizations it is indeed worth looking forward to at that moment zet was focused on the seemingly having discovered something he looked up and said I see that this weak point area places great emphasis on the fire defense system but before didn't you say that there are no more enemies in this world what is the purpose of this design of yours after all are these defense mechanisms not only to prepare for the insect species y Wu explained this is preparation for the potential occurrence of an Invasion From Another realm hearing this baby Beetle furrowed its brows and seriously asked an Invasion From Another realm is it possible that your kind has other species Crossing into our world Yu look serious and replied that's right there has been your Chen he that is crossed over therefore the likelihood of other species also crossing over is quite High baby Beetle praised truly deserving of your reputation ye woo you are able to think so deeply about this I was completely unaware of this issue before y Wu thought to himself pre previously the principal had told me about new insights related to the era of muddiness of earth that could be a chaotic period concerning time and Elemental forces moreover this chaos only intensifies over the flow of time even if we capture all the Dungeons and eliminate every beast in this world we cannot completely end the chaos the reason is that cross-dimensional elements will continually emerge and refresh at that moment I Vis appeared reporting master I have calculated the time required to to complete the construction of the entire weak point structure it will take a total of 60 days divided into three major phases phase one constructing the foundation and main frame of the weak point this process requires 1 b500 million funds and will take about 30 days to complete phase two proceeding with the construction of the main structures however we currently have exhausted the budget so we cannot continue y Wu smiled triumphantly it's okay this weak point cannot be built in a day we will build it step by step resources from the funds and other blueprints will be supplemented later I Vis replied Master is now a well-known figure capital is no longer a problem just then Elder lies communication appeared he hurriedly reported Master it's not good I am seizing this opportunity to report important news to you I am being threatened by Ling Yuan and her forces and I have now been pushed deep into the Wilderness her goal is to search for the one who disappeared 30 years ago the true deputy director of the Huang Jen Corporation Emperor shunt upon hearing this Yu's face turned pale shocked he could not believe what he had just heard Yu was extremely surprised I didn't expect Wong Jang to have such an independent identity I've never heard of it before moreover wasn't Ling Yuan under my control I instructed her to stay at home and wait for orders how could she run into the wilderness Elder lie quickly explained I truly witnessed a series of actions by Ling Yuan she used a fake death drug to enter a state of apparent death thus cutting off all contact with the outside world Therefore your orders no longer apply to her ogan said but in order to completely escape from your toxin control this woman continuously replaces the toxic blood with new blood right now she has changed her blood for the second time although the final effect is still unknown I believe that even if she cannot completely break free from the control at least it can reduce the effectiveness of your control to under 3/10 Yu felt worried upon hearing this I underestimated her this woman is not only cunning and decisive in her actions but she is also very cruel to herself as for that Emperor shunt suddenly a strange voice came from the other end of the line hey Elder lie can't you pull it out how long does it take to pull up the account don't waste our time any longer hurry up Elder Li panicked and quickly replied all right it's done you should take the opportunity to say a few last words to Yu master I can't prolong this any longer in the future I will try to find a chance to inform you about the situation here goodbye Master after saying that he hung up to avoid suspicion y Wu on this side also began to think and blame himself I can only blame my greed back then for not directly dealing with her thinking I could take advant of her a bit the result is leaving behind such a huge threat at that time did Ling yuun go to find the chairman of Wang Jang to obtain recovery her ambition is truly vast if it relates to the emperor shunt maybe mokai will know some information should I call her and ask a bit just after finishing his thought the system notified that moai was requesting a connection what a coincidence I was just about to call her he answered the call young lady is there something you need from me m n replied there's nothing serious I just wanted to invite you to dinner tonight just the two of us are you free he immediately agreed of course I actually had something to ask you as well where's the location M happily responded at the Heek Hotel 7:00 tonight I'll be waiting for you on the rooftop he answered all right I'll be there on time at exactly 7:00 in the evening finally he arrived at the meeting point a thought flicker in his mind saou once said this hotel is the most upscale in the area two rows of receptionists stood along the red carpet bowing and greeting him warmly welcome me wo everyone appeared very respectful causing him to feel somewhat tense this scene is really too extravagant it's my first time in a place like this and I can't help but feel a bit awkward the steward approached from a distance bowed his head liwo please follow me miss m has been waiting for you for a long time as he walked he observed his surroundings unable to suppress his curiosity he asked the steward but I find it a bit strange why aren't there any other guests around at that moment mokai stepped out from behind wearing a splendid blue dress her face radiant yet proud she replied of course because I have booked this entire floor is everything gone Yu thought he must have misheard thinking to himself then how much money would that cost this is too extravagant mokii covered her mouth and chuckled saying now that you are the fourth shareholder of hanmo a person worth hundreds of millions why are you still worried about such a small amount of money moreover this is just the current value once H Mo consolidates the entire Southwestern s Zone your value will definitely increase several times hearing this yiwu's eyes lit up thinking to himself this really makes one look forward to it it when he entered the room yiu spoke again however speaking of which this is my first time here the life of a wealthy person is truly simple sitting down at the nearly 10 m long dining table seeing the various dishes laid out Yu couldn't help but exclaim how luxurious M Nas this is all to repay you but compared to what you have done before it is nothing at all Yu felt a bit embarrassed and quickly said no need to be polite that is what I should do so where should I start saying that you move ate voraciously like a hungry tiger his mou constantly praising the delicious food Moi sitting beside him laughed and reminded him eat slowly or you'll choke Mo n shotly and nervously spoke up right now regardless of ability resources or status you have already reached the Pinnacle what's your next plan y woo like a fool fundamentally did not understand her meaning he straightforwardly replied none it's still a long way to go after that he shifted the topic to something else M9 let out a faint sigh and reiterated do you know in the Beast migration before there was a level 300 boss to defeat such a monster I think you still have a long journey ahead upon hearing this Yu's expression remained unchanged he replied I'm aware of that but life is inherently short the safe Zone where we live deep in the interior is truly very safe if it weren't for the incident at the teleportation gate this time perhaps we would never have the opportunity to face a fo of that caliber in our entire lives is it worth rushing through life like this listening to these words ye W's eyes suddenly became Resolute he lowered his voice and said perhaps you are right but even so I absolutely will not stop or confine myself within this narrow world because in this world Only the Strong can survive and even after becoming a strongman there will still be stronger ones challenging me therefore to not be defeated I must continuously grow stronger until I become the strongest moii upon hearing this felt a bit moved and admired guwu even more G woo perhaps this is the reason why you are strong those romantic entanglements will only become a burden on your path forward I just need to quietly observe you from behind support you that's enough truly it's really good at this moment Yu remembered the original reason he came to see moai he asked I heard you know the former deputy director of the Huong Jin group Emperor shunt moai was a bit confused and surprised Emperor shunt I've heard my father mentioned him before he belongs to my grandfather's generation why are you asking about him ye W didn't mind sharing I heard that Ling Yuan and his group are infiltrating the Wilderness with the intention of finding Emperor shunt Moi pondered with a serious expression so that's how it is this is indeed important intelligence I will report it to my father later as for him I vaguely remember Emperor shunt being quite obsessed she continued although the Wong Jen group was founded by him he often went to clear various dungeons alone leveling up focusing on his own skills and power rather than the company until 30 years ago he completely abandoned everything and disappeared Into the Wilderness alone he truly is a person of strong character Ling yuong said however I feel that finding the emperor shunt is impossible ywu asked in Surprise why Moki now replied in the first year after the emperor shunt disappeared there were still a few scattered pieces of news about him circulating but in the past 20 years there has been absolutely no information at all whether he is alive or dead no one knows Ling yuan is simply a rising force in recent years it's still uncertain if she has any connection with the emperor shunt perhaps she doesn't even have information that even his two biological Sons do not know yiu spoke up we cannot be careless this woman is very cunning without concrete intelligence we cannot make such a bet Yu further asked so when the emperor shunt disappeared what level was he at Moi replied perhaps at level 100 Yu thought to himself a strowman at level 100 30 years ago the question here is if he is still alive and has been leveling up what level would he be at now Yu was still contemplating typically a person like this apart from eating hygiene and resting would definitely be clearing dungeons or on the way to another dungeon with this pace it's already been 30 years I think if he were still alive I predict his rank would probably be around 200 right now both the Shadow King and when which accounts are unusable based on the chi and Emperor account at most I can fight Beyond 30 levels that means I must level up to at least 180 to have a chance at defeating Emperor shunt furthermore this is quite an optimistic calculation next I need to train hard to level up at the same time I will take advantage of the Surplus experience points to see if I can unlock new accounts in order to increase my combat tricks Mimi has been sitting beside me staring intently not knowing what I am really contemplating seeing me lost in thought Mimi asked V woo what are you thinking about I calmly replied it's nothing I was just thinking about how to handle it if Emperor shunt really comes back upon hearing this m naai suddenly recalled some childhood stories she said I remember when I was very young I once heard my grandfather tell stories about Emperor shunt he was not at all interested in power or wealth establishing Guang Jang was only to conveniently gather various resources to help himself Advance further in martial arts but when he reached level 100 he encountered a difficult bottleneck as a result he abandoned his two little sons and the family business venturing alone Into the Wilderness to seek greater challenges so even if Ling Yuan was truly found for someone who had long abandoned Wang Jang like him there would be no reason for him to intervene Yi Wu found M's analysis somewhat reasonable so he agreed with her way of thinking however his expression turned serious in his heart you w wondered could it really be like that with Ling yuan's temperament is she capable of making a decision that is almost a gamble in a situation with no certainty at all he told himself she must have grasped something now I can only hope for Elder lie hoping he can transmit some useful intelligence seeing Yu lost in thought m n couldn't help but laugh you always worry too much actually you should relax a bit don't frown all the time be careful or you'll get wrinkles upon hearing that ywo could only scratch his head with a Ry smile I probably won't MIM smiled and continued I know you really want to relax but this is not the time next I will focus on exploring the high level dungeon in the wilderness we may face a battle outside the safe Zone Moi n truly wanted to accompany yo she hesitated for a moment before saying what if you but before she could finish she quickly shook her head and changed her mind it's nothing whatever you plan just feel free to go I will be fully supporting you from behind y Wu was very grateful for M's heartfelt gesture all right by that time I will definitely let you see me become stronger y wo said the two clinked their glasses and drank under the Moonlight yes I'm really looking forward to it mokai replied on the way back Yi Wu continued to ponder recently so much as happened that makes me feel like it has been a long time since I was in the system space to devise plans the Shadow King and twin witch are indeed no longer usable the system appeared with a notification the mission progress of the Shadow King has reached 10% there are 4 days left until the forced relocation the cooling time for the twin Witch is still 4 days Yu pondered for a moment and then said these situations were already anticipated system upgrade the connection level of the Chien emperor to 180 the system accepted the order and replied upgrading the connection of the Chien Emperor a total of 100 million experience value will be consumed the new form of the Chen Emperor account has been unlocked the flame Shadow Emperor upon seeing the new form Yu could not help but gas OMG this looks increasingly Sinister increasingly unhuman is this the dark version of the Chien Emperor the system replied correct this is the form of the Chen emperor that materializes after fully Falling Into Darkness compared to the close combat style that uses a great sword this form focuses on manipulating invisible Shadows this is an all-purpose form combining physical attack magic offense defense melee and long range attacks yiu was extremely pleased with this form and found it very impressive he laughed and then continued to give orders to the system good keep going unlock two more accounts of IIs the system immediately received the order and announced unlocking new accounts acquired new titles master of forging and master of enchanting total cost 20 million experience points after unlocking Yu was curious and asked a what is special about these two titles tell me about them I Vis excited replied all right let me tell you master of forging is a specialized skill for crafting weapon equipment upon reaching this level you can craft equipment that surpasses your own level limitations moreover the efficiency of using materials will be higher and consumption will be lower for a Thrifty person like you this is definitely a must-have he paused for a moment and continued and what about master of enchanting it allows you to use drawings and elements to enchant weapons or defensive gear the special thing is that there are no level restrictions and the success rate is a full 100% here Vis passionately explained this ywu burst into laughter he coughed a few times to regain his composure and said whether it's being Frugal or not doesn't matter anymore I now have a total asset value of hundreds of billions you know y Wu considered two titles with special abilities noting that if he could support the equipment strength of both the team and himself then investing 20 million experience points wouldn't be a waste he nodded in agreement and then remembered to address a matter related to I's friend link the I Vis owned the man account which could only be used once although the account's strength was very powerful it was limited by the deration of usage and accompanying side effects he asked the system if there was a way to upgrade it to remove these limitations after calculations the system informed him that the time limitation could be removed at the cost of 20 million experience points however the side effects could not be eliminated Yi Wu decided to go ahead he thought removing the time limit has enough value and the sign effects can be manageable if I am cautious the system confirmed the command and proceeded with the upgrade upon completion the the man account was reactivated with no time limit however the system warned that prolonged use would lead to the accumulation of considerable anger value necessitating the use of skills to relieve pressure on the battlefield if not negative effects similar to losing Health would occur Yu replied I understand open a new account as well let's see if there are any surprises the system received the command and unlocked a new account at the cost of 5 million experience points the newly activated account was Ace mechanic hxa mouu bringing promising potentials he was the top pilot when the world faced an alien invasion controlling Ace mechanic and single-handedly confronting an entire alien Fleet in the end he stormed into the drive core of the fleet's mothership engaging in a mutual destruction with the Invader saving his home planet y wo felt quite satisfied with this new account he told himself it seems I've opened a hero account but this isn't the combat power I want moreover the positioning ability seems a bit coincidental with the Master's thesis project the system responded defensively explaining no I V Master's thesis project can unleash 100% of the properties encapsulating various mechas but Ace mechanic siuu can unleash up to 300% upon hearing this Yu was incredibly excited he exclaimed 300% in other words it's like increasing the level by three times that's awesome so if I use I visibility to craft a super vehicle and then use Ace mechanics ability to level it up it would be fantastic the system replied reminding him a wish is indeed beautiful but the current account is in a rudimentary State and can only achieve a 150% upgrade to reach 300% you need to continue using experience points to unlock y Wu smiled foolishly and replied to the system I know then he turned to say goodbye to excel long long all right I've gained quite a bit of experience and my combat power has been replenished well next there's something important I need to do goodbye sha long long I didn't have the chance to let you shine before but there will be a time for you to show your worth later shell long long happily responded on the other side Yin Mong was laxi in the B she hummed a few Tunes but suddenly the system rang notifying her that Yu was requesting to connect with her yinan was surprised she didn't expect it to be yiu on the other end of the line he spoke up it's me why the sudden call has something happened Yin hu forgot she was in the bath hearing his voice she awkwardly submerged herself in the water and quietly replied nothing it's just that you called out of the blue so I was a bit surprise is there something you need yiu got straight to the point are you free tomorrow I plan to go to the dungeon training ground that I accepted earlier to challenge it you should come too because you missed leveling up in the new Zer Temple dungeon before your level is a bit behind the others in the team it's time for you to level up when Yin hoan heard Yu's invitation she joyfully agreed without hesitation really that's great I will definitely be there on time tomorrow the next day everyone had arrived at the meeting point as agreed luu Fang was excited this is awesome we get to go dungeon diving with senior to level up Ruan T and tan asked with some curiosity where exactly is the dungeon we want to dive into today is it in the wilderness again Yu replied it's the trial place where I got the key to the dungeon last time we don't need to go to the Wilderness we can directly enter the dungeon here Lu Fang was impatient I can't wait any longer so what are we waitting for letun hurry up and go Yu remained calm as he responded not yet we still have to wait for one more person who are we waiting for everyone wondered suddenly the wind began to whip up violently and everyone looked up Lu Fang recognized that it was the spacecraft of hanmo Corporation Yin hu jumped down from the ship and greeted sorry to keep you waiting everyone Lu Fang was a bit shocked I can't believe it the person senior wanted to wait for his you are you really planning to join us in combat this time Ruan T happily and excitedly said that's great you weren't there the last time in the dungeon and I always felt regretful this time you finally came and we can fight with Yin Juan Yin Hanan while encouraging everyone outwardly yes everyone give it your all but inside she secretly blamed herself I thought it would just be him and me what am I even hoping for one how who was piloting the spaceship seemed unaware of the tense atmosphere he even intentionally teased make sure to enjoy this rare date Yin buan when you come back there's still that hellish training from Lao J waiting for you Yu don't let our little sister get hurt goodbye Wan how's words ignited the Curiosity of Lu Fang and Ruan TN on Lu Fang teas I didn't expect the senior to win over the number one beauty of the Mong team that's really impressive ruin T and tyan chimed in but what about Mo young lady and Kai XI hearing this Yi Wu got so angry he was shaking and shouted Wan how just you wait for me then Yi Wu waved his hand and opened the portal leading to the dungeon he turned back to remind everyone let's go today we're going to clear the dungeon all day long everyone agrees right stepping inside everyone was stunned is this really the trial dungeon it doesn't seem like an ordinary d Instead This Place resembles a competition Arena at that moment the system announced welcome Challengers next I will explain the trial rules clearly trial rules this dungeon belongs to the secret realm form and includes 100 floors every 10 floors an a league highlevel monster will appear by defeating the Beast that appears on each floor you can open the teleportation door leading to the next floor the rewards of each floor will be accumulated and players have the right to stop Midway to receive all accumulated rewards this place has a Time evaluation system for clearing levels based on the evaluation level the rewards will vary including experience points cash and various rare items finally if a challenger unfortunately dies Midway they will be forcibly returned to the first floor although they will still receive the accumulated experience points returning will disqualify them from receiving highlevel Treasures after hearing the rules everyone looked at each other with serious Expressions they all understood that this was not just a simple challenge but also a great opportunity let's get started one person spoke up their eyes shining with determination ye wo wondered can you come back to life after dying in the dungeon I'd never heard of such a thing this kind of setup seems a bit too lenient I'm not quite used to it right now yinon explained the mechanics of the dungeon in this trial type are like that to put it plainly it just means the dungeon has deemed you lost not that you truly died y Wu understood so that's how it is the system asked again would you like to begin the challenge now yiu confidently replied without hesitation let's start the system initiated the challenge first three beasts appeared a level one Beast a level one fish man and a level one wild boar Lu Fang stepped forward to fight using a lethal skill a chaotic group disappeared instantly the time taken to eliminate them was merely 1 second Lu Fang realized something the dungeon has 100 Floors the first floor only has level one beasts it seems that with each floor you pass the level of the monsters will also increase by one Ru Tian tan added the challenges we face now can be easily cleared the real difficulty will definitely arise when the number of floors surpasses our current levels ye woo nodded that's right however the key point of this dungeon is leveling up not suppression we must use the quickest speed to clear the stages to achieve the highest rating therefore efficiency is everything when you can no longer kill quickly I will step in saying that he went up to the next floor with everyone currently they had reached the 10th floor and a minute and 13 seconds had passed by the 30th Flor the time was 9 minutes and 20 seconds on the 60th floor the time was 21 minutes and 18 seconds the skull ghost on the 60th floor was not easy to deal with at all Lu Fang felt a bit frustrated thinking isn't the elite monster on the 60th floor supposed to be taken down immediately how infuriating Ruan tantan also began to worry if we can't kill it quickly then the time will be extended even more Yin huan decisively cut the monster in half with a single strike he smiled and said you two have worked hard now I will take over the challenge l bang felt a bit embarrassed and turned to say I'm sorry everyone I'm sorry senior I almost messed things up Ru and tan also felt guilty we've taken too long on this level will it affect our treasure grade youu looked at them not wanting them to feel awkward it's okay I will make up for this little time later if it's just for the reward I can handle it alone he explained further giving the earlier levels to you two was to take the opportunity to learn especially in situ ations that require quickly dealing with powerful enemies we may encounter similar situations in the future so we need to be mentally prepared everyone happily nodded in agreement got it y Wu turn to remind Yin Juan you need to control yourself don't use skills that drain too much energy we have to clear all day they continued their Journey Through the dungeon by the time they reached 470 the time was 24 minutes 11 seconds when they reached 480 the time was 28 minutes 16 seconds by the time they got to 490 the clock showed 32 minutes 9 seconds at this point though Yin Hanan still had 79% Health her energy was depleted she began to feel tired this focus on quick kills was harder than she imagined the three Elite monsters all hell life force resonance mechanism meaning they couldn't take them down one by one they had to aggressively attack all at once Yin huan said her voice a bit weak I've tried to conerve Mana but now it's all gone Yu supported her reassuring her if you're out of Mana you could take potions what I'm worried about is your mental fatigue no need to rush take it easy I'll handle the later part hearing this Yin Ruan felt that Yi Wu care a lot about her she seemed completely touched by him behind them Lu Fang couldn't help but tease look at how senior is supporting her Ru and Tian Tien chimed in giggling the holding hands now he y woo upon hearing their taunts became Furious and decided to threaten them using the account the flame Shadow Emperor each word he uttered was filled with immense power scaring everyone to death subsequently y Wu unleashed the ability to burn everything to ashes Lu Fang standing aside felt a bit flustered senior are you really going to burn down the competition Arena upon reaching the 91st floor the display time was 32 minutes 9 seconds the monsters appeared and were instantly incinerated by Yi Wu Vanishing completely everyone was left in amazement Lu Fang couldn't help but exclaim is the usage time 0 seconds this is true murder the beasts as soon as they took shape were eradicated truly ruthless as they progressed to the 92nd Flo the time was 32 minutes 11 seconds for the 93rd Flo the time was 32 minutes 12 seconds for the 94 floor the time was 32 minutes 13 seconds with each level Yu Meed only a single second to resolve the threats Lu Fang stood a gape completely astonished I seriously suspect that if he didn't have to pause to transition after each floor the senior could have remained in one spot and slaughtered through 100 Floors when they reached the 100 Floor the final boss finally appeared it was the Dark Lord he roared in Anger you foolish humans do you dare to invade my territory this is truly seeking your own death Lu Fang had just finished speaking when a burst of flame erupted incinerating his opponent right in the hand of the flame Shadow Emperor the system immediately announced dungeon level 100 completed in 32 minutes and 19 seconds congratulations overall ranking SSS the Challenger has surpassed the challenge with the highest rating and received the diamond grade Treasure Chest cheers erupted everywhere everyone was excited continuously praising amazing this is the highest rank the Lively atmosphere became even more vibrant as people eagerly awaited the moment to open the treasure chest L fan couldn't hide his impatience urging open the treasure hurry up and open the treasure I can't wait any longer what good things are inside finally the treasure chest was opened inside lay a wealth of rewards that left everyone in awe 20 million experience points 10 million cas Ash 100 level 100 magic crystals in addition there was a great wizard Spectre a two-handed wizard it was a legendary Wizard with extremely high magic power accompanied by dazzling effects and unyielding close combat capability Lu Fang gazed at the wizard unable to contain his admiration so awesome this is indeed a godsend for the Mage just maximizing the skill points for one technique is enough to unleash terrifying power the vibrant atmosphere spere continued to spread with everyone excitedly sharing the joy with L Fang and his teammates the second item is the Ajax Shield classified as a huge Shield which the Great Hero Ajax use its infinite defensive power can be compared to the most solid walls the characteristic of The Shield is that half of the physical damage from ranged attacks is highly likely to be blocked and it can withstand physical damage from close combat the third item is the sword of the Pure White Knight classified as a sharp sword this is the type of Sword used by the Knights of the Pure White Knight order it is extremely sharp and possesses holy attributes increasing damage by 30% against the evil Immortal race the fourth item is the magic sword the making of darkest blueprint the necessary materials include the sword of the Pure White Knight remnants of light 80 magic crystals of level 100 and 5 million cash after the Pure White Knight order was corrupted they transformed into the Dark Knight and their weapons were also eroded by evil resulting in a transformation the fifth item is the training field key forecast classified as a skill book it can sense the location of the key for the Next Level Training dungeon finally there is the training field Black Rock This is a mysterious Stone and after gathering enough something good may happen everyone has received their loot tanan took the wizard luang took the Ajax Shield Yu also brought the sword to gift to Yin one is it really a good sword do you really want to give it to me y Wu happily replied of course moreover I have also prepared to use the design that just fell out to forge and upgrade the legendary magic sword for you Yin Wong took the sword still unable to believe it she said you actually know how to forge this is really hard to believe but how do we gather the necessary materials for the forging Yu smiled appearing calm that's why I said it's skillful the residual materials of Light which are essential for forging just happen to be the materials that dropped when we fought different a last time I didn't expect they could be used in this case consider it a return of the favor from before Yin hang chuckled thinking to herself you fool what favor there's no need to repay after that yiwu quickly switched his account to mosai the master forger Lu Fang standing beside teased senior is is starting to act all high and mighty again y wed a few lines of code then turned to announce the magic sword darkest has been forged it's complete try it out quickly Yin Wang was astonished as she held the sword in her hand she exclaimed incredible holding it I can feel the boundless power surging the magic sword darkus had finally appeared its mythical passive skill included destruction increases damage by 100% against enemies with dark attributes and non-attribute increases damage by an additional 50% against Immortal races demons angels and humans the effect stacks on enemies with the same racial attributes Yin Wong looked at the sword her heart filled with emotions y wo explain further this legendary magic sword focuses on damage output making it very suable to coordinate with my demon body however each time I use the demon body it consumes a demon Crystal if I run out what should I do Yin hoan replied demon crystals are special legendary grade crystals extremely rare although they do not contain magic power themselves they have the ability to store and enhance the magic power I have accumulated each time I use the demon body I must consume one demon Crystal therefore most of my income is spent on this investment Yi Wu thought to himself I wonder if M gemology master account can transer form demon crystals if it can change the properties of this consumable it would surely save Yin Juan a significant amount of money perhaps I should look for an opportunity to try it later regarding sensory ability the training field key forecast seems to demonstrate that the dungeon does not exist independently from the number of Black Stone fragments it can be inferred that there are still nine other related training places in order to Target the diamond grade treasures we must obtain all of them to Clear the Stage Lu Fang spoke up senior let's quickly start the next round I can't wait any longer ywu presented everyone with a decision now there are two paths to choose from the first path is to continue clearing the trial area although the experience points and cash will not change the items that can be obtained from Diamond level Treasures will definitely not be as good as the first time the second path is to directly absorb the magic crystals to level up yiu explained level 100 magic crystals for me are almost in excess so there are enough for three people to use Lu Fang expressed some concerns and said senior I actually thought about this from the beginning but my conversion rate for magic crystals is only 35% ttin tan followed up the converion rate I have when using them together would be equivalent to mine therefore I think it is unnecessary to waste them like that upon hearing this Yi Wu turned to ask Yin ju what is your conversion rate unexpectedly Yin buan answered with a surprising number my conversion rate is 95% Lu Fang and Tian tyen could not hide their admiration 95% that's impressive she truly is the chosen one even doing nothing just relying on magic crystals she can continuously level up yiu pondered a conversion rate exceeding 85% can prevent the diminishing returns of absorbing highle magic crystals especially since she has 95% this means that as long as she has enough highle magic crystals she can continuously absorb and level up without stopping after a moment of contemplation yiu added I still had some level 160 magic crystals on hand at that moment yinan spoke for me although absorbing magic crystals can quickly level up a level like that is just like a flower vase it shatters at the slightest touch I prefer to continuously break through and accumulate my own experience through real Combat that is the path of becoming strong that I pursue upon hearing this Lu Fang and Tian tyen expressed their admiration their eyes shining brightly no wonder you are the goddess Yin Juan we must learn from you y Wu nodded in satisfaction that's right if we all go through hardships how can we overcome the survival challenges in the apocalypse if that's the case we decide to clear the dungeon next I will activate the continuous clearing mode everyone get ready the group began to clear the dungeon non-stop they continuously surpassed the fifth round the seventh and even reached the 40th time until the sun set when Yu opened the portal to return it was already dark he turned back to look at everyone and asked how do you all feel now Lu Fang collapsed to the ground panting My Level has reached 83 as long as I don't stop the level will continue to rise But ultimately humans have their limits tyen tyan could no longer bear sat down on the ground and vomited I reached level 80 but my body is too exhausted Yin Hanan was also fatigued lying flat on the ground however she stated contentedly My Level has reached 115 but with this level of intensity I hope next time we can adjust it to be more suitable the group lay down to rest their eyes clearly showing exhaustion but they could not hide their joy for the achievements they had made yiu spoke up it's a Pity that it's enough for three people to want to clear it but there will be no more opportunities because the key to this dungeon has used up its limit of 50 times as soon as he finished speaking the key shattered in pieces Yi Wu thought to himself just as I expected the treasures that open up afterward are all trash the fragment of Black Stone didn't drop either to collect enough the only way left is to go to the next trial level suddenly Mio ba appeared everyone has worked hard to clear the dungeon dinner is about to be ready I will bring it up for everyone right away everyone was surprised tantan ran over and hugged Mio baow tightly let me hug you quickly she showered kisses all over Mio baow feeling immediately healed Lu Fang curiously asked senior when did you bring it out yeu colly replied before that after sending the kexa group away I remember that Mio ba was still in the dungeon so I brought it out Mio ba with tearful eyes full of Hope said Master if you hadn't come to get me I would have been stressed out by now I waited in the dungeon for so long when will you come to get me Yin buan wondered are you Yu's new pet you said you know how to cook with your furry pause I trust my own cooking skills even more Mio ba was extremely angry after hearing this she shouted what did you say my cooking skills have made countless delicious dishes the two sides argued fiercely Yin Juan unwilling to back down taunted it's decided I will cook a delicious meal for yiu myself Mio ba infuriated retorted then let's see who cooks better Yin huan walked away with an air of confidence in the end both dishes were presented Mio bows looked dazzling appetizing making one want to eat immediately meanwhile Yin wans was burnt to a Crest feeling embarrassed Yin Juan picked up a piece of the food cooked by Mio ba and put it in her mouth she murmured although this is my first time cooking I don't believe a cat can cook better than I can just after finishing the first bite Yin Huong was astonished and exclaimed this is truly delicious but not even a second later she quickly turned to apologize to Mio ba Mio senior I was wrong please accept me as your Junior I also want to make delicious dishes like this for y wo everyone burst into laughter Mio baow no longer made things difficult for Yin Guan and smiled saying if you sincerely want to learn then I will teach you suddenly the system displayed contact from fatties y Wu pressed reply his voice urgent what's wrong fatties it's not time for our scheduled communication yet what on Earth has happened on the other end of the line a weak voice came through the unstable connection V woo it's not good our base has been attacked we need support yiu was taken aback what are you saying sa G despite only having a few seconds tried to convey the situation the damn specific communication based station attack their Firepower is too strong we're fighting hard your family the connection was too weak and ye Wu couldn't hear everything fatties was saying he anxiously shouted hello fatties what about my family fatties fatties didn't respond and Yu was extremely worried his mind racing with a multitude of questions about his family situation D it I was planning to pick them up tomorrow and now this happens the night before is this a coincidence or has someone been plotting this all along in his agitation unable to remain calm I want to go save my family but Yin Guan rushed over tightly huging him tried to keep him calm vwu don't act rashly please stay calm for a moment the situation out there is very complicated danger is everywhere if you rush in without any preparation you'll die at the very least you need to think carefully about how to respond first listening to the advice y w managed to quell the anger within him she is right the survival principle in this era is to absolutely not act without thorough preparation charging Into the Wilderness in the dead of night would be truly Reckless just now I almost lost my reason I apologize Yin wuan nodded lightly feeling reassured that you would call calm down I don't blame you in such a situation no one can easily control their emotions Yi Wu turned to say I'm sorry Mio ba I'm sorry to you I wasted the dinner that you carefully prepared Mio ba smiled and gently replied it's okay Master food can be made again but kxi only has one you must definitely save kixi Lu Fang wondered who on Earth dared to attack a senior's people y Wu spoke up it seems that that the name is the specific communication base station he tried to ask Yin buan have you ever heard of this name Yin huan shook her head and replied basically I have never heard of it I know about large and famous organizations in the wilderness to some extent therefore I guess the specific communication based station is just a smallscale violent group formed by a few Exiles organizations like this are everywhere in the wilderness yiu was extremely angry and could not understand even though the quality of the members of The Horizon combat team is not that good the scale cannot be considered small even if ambushed it shouldn't result in a disastrous defeat what exactly is the background of this specific communication based station perhaps I have underestimated the Wilderness too much which has led to my family and friends being put in danger he looked at Yin Juan and said Yin Hanan Among Us you are the one who understands the Wilderness the best I hope you can share the real to help me resolve this difficult situation Yin hoan smiled Riley why are you being so polite today don't worry I will tell you everything I know saying that she took out a projection device and began to explain to everyone as you all know after the anomaly several hundred years ago Earth has taken on its current appearance humans have to concentrate on living within safe zones while outside the safe zones lies A wilderness filled with dangers however this does not mean that there are no humans living out there she continued the people in the wilderness are divided into two types the first type consists of concentrated communities of residents to put it simply they are the poor tribes they mainly consist of low-level villagers who depend on Hunting low-level demon beasts and simple production skills to sustain their lives in grooves she continued every day I live in a precarious existence unsure if today will lead to tomorrow another category consists of teams that live in the wild made up of mercenaries Relic hunters and Exiles in places like the Wilderness there are countless organizations of this kind among them there are also quite a few teams of considerable scale however due to the scarcity of resources in the wild they do not have the confidence to confront Us in safe zones at least this holds true in Demon Beast areas she continued all right next is some information about the environment in the wilderness for example the noise in interference that just occurred in the communication the reason is the presence of an undefined type of energy in this area capable of disrupting communication particularly the farther you are from the safe Zone especially over 500 km the stronger the interference becomes communication can only be restored if you are within the radiation range of the specific communication bases scattered throughout the Wilderness she said this undefined type of energy not only disrupts electromagnetic fields and positioning but also turns this area into a noi Zone therefore most people opt to use cars or walk to explore the Wilderness Knights here are incredibly dangerous not only due to the brutal demon beasts but also because of poor visibility even experienced Hunters can easily lose their way thus when night falls most choose to camp in place she said the scariest thing in the wild is the Mist land that randomly appears referred to as the buug land she continued although its occurrence rate is very low once trapped in it people will be restricted by its bizarre rules if they violate the rules it will ignore ranks and devour you Lu Fang was a bit astonished ignoring ranks what in the wilderness there exists such a place the buug land truly fitting the name tyen tingan also wondered is that specific communication-based Station built by humans Yin huan replied seriously I don't know most of these stations were left from ancient times but there are also some that were researched and built by humans later people in the wilderness even rely on this specific communication based station to delineate their spheres of influence Yi Wu standing nearby was in deep thought based on the intelligence available the most reasonable action now is to use the communication from fatties to find the coordinates of the corresponding specific communication based station after that we can visit the site for exploration next we need to focus on searching for clues about the specific communication based station in the wilderness as of now I don't know anything about them and I must gather some basic information first to plan the next steps as for the concerns about nighttime and getting lost they are not worrisome I have mowi map and the eye of positioning after upgrading as long as I avoid entering the missed land there should be no danger at all YW spoke up all right I've made up my mind let's set off Yin West gested I'll go with you even tyen Tian and mioa wanted to follow but Lu Fang immediately stopped them don't go senior this time we're going to rescue someone we must prioritize speed and efficiency moreover this is deep in the wilderness which is extremely dangerous if you come along we'll just be a burden to you the goddess ginan is no exception everyone found Lu Fang's words reasonable inide side and acceptance ti ti reluctantly Ed that's true I thought this level up would finally allow me to be of help miow also felt a bit sad I don't want to hold back my master y Wu reassured Mio ba don't worry Kai XI will definitely be fine I will surely bring her back safely in front of you mioa happily replied okay mi always trusts Master Yu nodded and immediately set off everyone stood watching as his figure gradually disappeared L Fang said his wishes senior you must deal with those crazy fools in the wilderness who know no bounds gin huan thought to herself I right now basically cannot help him if it goes on like this he will drift further away from me I must become stronger Yu had arrived in the wilderness and began searching around the last contact with Fatty's group was 1,000 Camp from the safe Zone have they really ventured deep into the wild thankfully I have Mo Way's map and the upgraded eye of positioning which can maintain this state for a long time this dark Wilderness looks like daylight to me level 65 strange beasts began to appear look I've spotted a moving dinner a level teenager dares to enter the Wilderness at night aren't they tired of living the Beast saw the beautiful wings and thought to itself These Wings will belong to me yiwu swept through and completely eliminated the strange beasts pushing them aside get lost don't block my way he landed on the ground thinking I flew quickly the whole way from the safe Zone to here it took over an hour I hope I can still see familiar scenery but before him lay a devastated land surrounded by countless strange beasts Yu pondered what kind of battle has this place been through have I arrived too late the strange beasts discovered y woo and roared there's a living person fresh meat they rushed in but were all burned to ashes by yiwo beneath the pile of corpses a weak voice echoed help someone help me Yu couldn't believe it and exclaimed is there still someone lucky enough to survive the person was wangu she was dying weakly saying thank thank you for saving me he who took out a blue potion and reassured her don't talk take this recovery potion you'll be fine Wang hoi hurriedly drank the entire vial her Vitality slowly recovered she looked at Yu with grateful eyes and said said I'm saved I thought I was sure to die thank you so much y asked you are a member of The Horizon combat team right what the hell happened here recalling the memory of the sudden attack W who couldn't hide her fear she trembled as she recounted after Nightfall Captain Lan King Yun LED everyone to take shelter at this communication station suddenly we were ambushed by demon beasts in the wilderness such things are not uncommon but while everyone was fighting against the demon beasts a horrifying incident occurred her voice choked her red eyes embraced her head as she cried H woo don't don't come over here yiu firmly held her shoulders comforting her calm down what exactly happened W hoie trembled all over sobbing hooo Dad I'm scared he panicked thinking she must have seen something terrifying causing mental trauma I can't use conventional methods to help her regain her composure I can only then he began to hypnotize her shock in the brain calm down for me she suddenly came to her senses exclaiming ah Wang H was alert what happened why am I crying it feels like my brain froze for a few seconds Yu consoled her don't worry about that let's continue with the previous topic when you were resisting the demon Beast what suddenly happened fear surged in her eyes she trembled as she recounted when we fought against the demon beasts suddenly five people appeared I wasn't familiar with them but I heard Captain l king Yun called them the fragmented Dawn the captain tried to collaborate with them but those people didn't say a word then they directly transformed into powerful demon beasts and summon more demon beasts to attack us our team quickly got surrounded senior land told us to split into three groups he and how shuai would go distract them and I was a signed to escort yanf along with a team with fatties hearing this he hurriedly asked yanf are you talking about my sister what about my family where are a did they manage to escape Wang hoi suddenly said sister family could it be that you are senior Yu upon hearing this she became even more frightened and anxiously replied I'm sorry senior I didn't know we were just about to break through the encirclement when we were attacked by the demon beasts I was knocked unconscious and when I woke up I found myself buried among the dead fortunately you saved me but I really didn't know anything I'm sorry realizing that his actions were excessive Yi Wu let her go and spoke gently no it's my fault for being too agitated so you must know the Escape Route that land King Yun designated for you right he speculated from the noisy sounds in Fatty's phone it seems they are moving away from the information station finding the Escape Route for first and then chasing after them to see if there's anything to discover is a reasonable Choice she gasped and replied yes I know then she pointed in the opposite direction and said earlier we retreated in this direction y Wu nodded started to walk and said I understand now I will go find them you should find a safe place to hide let's ACT tomorrow morning suddenly Wang Drew her sword her gaze becoming mysterious are you going to abanded me after saying this she swiftly cut down a demon beast in front of her then sadly said I understand a small character like me will only drive you down she cheerfully waved her hand and said although my time with Yun Fay was very short we have become good friends so senior Yu you must save yanf Yu broke out in a sweat reluctantly replying to her all right but inside he was terrified he thought to himself I almost lost my 50 m long big knife I was worried that the tradition of large scale art being stabbed in the back was about to be activated again suddenly she collapsed clutching her stomach in pain H my stomach something is moving inside it hurts so much Yu turned his head in panic and asked what's wrong with you she screamed help unexpectedly something exploded and a bright red light Shone directly at them yiu was covered in blood a demon Beast appeared laughing gleefully haha it turned out to be a night walker insect it loudly said the breeding failed this woman is too weak not suitable for nurturing how about we switch to a man instead suddenly a purple light surrounded the demon Beast it screamed in pain what is happening the purple light shot up transforming into a large cross Yi Wu disdainfully replied is this what Wilderness is human life here is so fragile sorry let this dark flame cross be your tomstone he spread his wings and said I promise you I will definitely rescue Yuni and bring them back arriving in the desolate Forest he thought to himself now I have to rely on the base and the large traces they left behind to search first then he landed looked around and said there are signs that a battle occurred here carefully observing the footprints on the ground he realized the footprints are scattered Ed he deduced this scene suggests two possibilities either they successfully dispersed to escape or they were caught by the fragmented Dawn but the probability of being captured is slightly higher he continued to ponder I can't waste time searching based on these scattered Footprints first I need to clarify information related to the fragmented Dawn if I find them I will surely find Yun feay but in this Wilderness I don't know anyone how can I inquire suddenly he remembered that's right previously on the online Network in the central conference I once met a card woman she left me an address in this Wilderness and if the fragmented Dawn also relies on using drugs to transform into demon beasts then that girl who is a pharmacist is very likely to have information related to it he took out the paper with the address looked at it and read Wilderness C30 concentration Zone number 24 let's try our luck there at the C30 concentration area before the thick steel door a cold voice rang out stop this is a restricted area unauthorized Personnel keep out scram or I will shoot on the spot y Wu halted looking up at the Watchtower inside was surely a mid-level concentration area with quite a few people coming and going he reminded himself I cannot act recklessly Yu raised both hands high and called out loudly don't shoot don't shoot I'm not unauthorized red I'm an engineer pharmacist enchanter blacksmith just tell me what you need I can do it all just let me into the city a voice from the Watchtower echoed down full of Doubt huh what's this kid saying I don't like tricksters y Wu quickly replied please I'm not lying to you really but another voice shouted get lost if not we will open fire in the ruat top the tower a man reclined in his chair irritably calling out what's all this noise in the middle of the night can a person get some sleep a subordinate flustered entered and reported Captain there's a kid outside wanting to get into the city he says he's an engineer pharmacist a whole bunch of other things the captain quickly got up from his seat approached y Wu and said to his subordinate hasn't the central water pump in our town been broken for a few days now he claims to be an engineer so let him try to fix it if he really gets it working that will be our achievement and if he can't fix it then take all the money on him beat him up and throw him out after all there will be no loss for us the subordinate immediately responded with enthusiasm Captain you are wise then they opened the gate and Led You woo to the central water pump in the town this was the place one of the group said you claimed to be an engineer fix this water pump for us otherwise don't think about leaving you woo follow behind and replied all right all right all right he examined it carefully thinking to himself in such a big town there is only this average water pump life is indeed difficult compared to the safe Zone it's truly like paradise but now is not the time to lament I need to fix this machine first as he was busy inspecting someone yelled loudly from afar stop yosa the Mater's daughter was holding a flashlight and hurriedly running towards them she kept saying who told this stranger to come and fix it do you want everyone in the town to die of thirst the team leader heard this and hesitated a bit only able to scratch his head and laugh it off missa the water pump has actually been broken for several days this kid claims he is an engineer I think we should let him fix it however yaa still glared at the other party and scolded if he says it must be if he says he is your father would you believe him hurry up and get him out of here for me just then his voice rang out it's fixed here is the water pump immediately the mechanisms of the pump began to operate the group couldn't help but exclaim astonishment ha yoso was stunned unable to believe her eyes how can this be this water pump requires at least a mid-level engineer to fix the teen leader who was just pale with fear now breathed the sigh of relief and said I I told you I said this kid could definitely fix it haha y Wu lightly tapped on the side of the pump looked at the others and continued not only have I fixed it but I can also upgrade the power of this water pump during the upgrade the water flow will also be supplemented with a filtration function however I don't know how much groundwater you have so I advise you to still use it cautiously the two gate guards were so moved they wanted to cry and said this is great finally we can drink clean water another added who we haven't had drinking water for days thank you so much the girl yosa though still arrogant also knew how to be sensible to express her regrets I didn't expect that I could be mistaken too but wrong is wrong I still have to apologize to you I'm sorry but you can't blame me because you look just like a young master who just ran out of the safe Zone without any life experience without a hint of dust on you mistaking you is something very normal upon hearing these words he was taken aback and quickly explained I'm not any young Master at all nor is it because I lack life experience I'm here to find someone the address she left for me is right here concentration area C30 number 24 hearing this yel was extremely surprised isn't number 24 shm Mo's house but you came at the wrong time 3 days ago she went out to pick herbs and hasn't come back since however Yu crossed his arms in front of his chest adopting a suspicious demeanor and interrogating is that so yosa being treated as a liar became Furious and yelled hey what is that expression on your face do you really think I'm lying to you you can doubt my temper but you have no right to doubt my character follow me I'll take you to see he looked at the figure in front of him and couldn't help but feel scared before long both of them stopped in front of a house with a tightly shut door yosa stepped forward and said to him see I told you she's not home right y pong seeing this became frustrated knocked on the door and shouted damn it I have something urgent to discuss I need to find her immediately Yos was startled and quickly reminded him wow why are you yelling like that what do you mean to find her for if you're in trouble why not tell me maybe I can help after all our town ows you a great favor hearing this y w turned to look at her with a puzzled expression so do you know the fragmented Dawn the people I'm looking for are them she quickly replied the fragmented Dawn I think I've heard of them but I'm not too sure if you want to find someone let me take you and meet my dad he's the mayor here and knows a lot of things then thank you ywu nodded an agreement both of them walked Under The Starry Night Sky yosa continued to chat her voice a bit admiring although this might not be the right time to mention it I truly admire you you're about the same age as me yet you've already reached the intermediate level of engineering he asked in surprise I can see you're very interested in engineering so what's your level ysep pause for a moment before answering I'd like playing with machines since I was a child but I learned everything on my own right now I can only say I'm a beginner I'm still very far from being a qualified engineer so can you teach me he was silent for a moment before replying this isn't the right time for that let's talk about it later she mischievously smiled since you didn't refuse I'll take that as your agreement di Yi Wu found it hard to argue back so V just stayed silent after a while they arrived at their destination yosa decisively kicked the door breaking it partially she shouted loudly dad are you home UT taiu was sitting with several others hearing his daughter's voice he immediately scolded how many times have I told you girl when you enter use your hands to push not your feet to kick yosa noticed a group of people and quietly asked why are you still having a meeting at midnight dad he rubbed his forehead looking troubled damn it isn't it because the water pump keeps breaking down we're discussing where to find a mid-level engineer to fix it and at the same time figuring out how to deal with the scoundrel Who Sold us this jump machine if I catch him I'll skin Him Live the girl quickly LED gu wo into the house excitedly saying no more hassle the water machine has been repaired by y Wu already you looked in everyone politely speaking I apologize for bothering you all so late yo Tai Zoo suspicious wanted to confirm really you were not tricking me are you sesa someone immediately reported ah there is indeed water now mayor and moreover this water is much sweeter than before hearing that he stepped forward put his arm around Yu and happily said since ancient times Heroes have emed emerged from youth you are the hero of our town how much reward do you want as long as I can do it I will give it to you haha yiu replied with a serious face I don't need money taiu surprised asked again so what you want yiu tilted his head looked at him and softly said I want information about the Fright Meed Dawn do you have it hearing that yok taiu was stunned for a moment he looked at the people around and ordered you all go to sleep now I have something to discuss with ywo everyone replied in unison yes mayor however yaa his daughter pouted and protested I don't want to why should I listen to Dad I want to stay here Yu looked at her his serious gaze carrying a hint of intimidation if you still want me to agree to the previous matter it's best to obediently listen to your father and step outside first yosa immediately obeyed and before going out side she did not forget to remind all right I will wait outside just instruct me if you need anything Tai zooo seeing the dramatic change in his stubborn daughter was left speechless silently screaming in his heart what the heck this spicy little girl even I can't handle her and yet this guy managed to make her obey with just a few words y Wu unexpectedly asked can we talk now he replied with some concern of course but this fragmented Dawn is a secret topic that few people know about just fixing the water pump is not enough the two Sat facing each other and he casually asked no wonder you're the mayor you really are sharp in business go ahead what do you want me to do yo taiu happily sipped his barley and said I like dealing with someone like you straightforward and to the point my request is very simple I hope you can help me reinforce the walls of the town if you can repair the water pump then I believe this small matter will be nothing for you after that with a grim face yo taiu continued but for people living in the wilderness like us this is a big deal related to the extension of Our Lives I hope you can understand after all you live in a safe area so you probably can't imagine how hard we've tried just to survive y Wu also subtly understood the implication I can understand and agree to your condition but how can I judge that the intelligence you mentioned is not deceiving me the mayor then confidently assured this source of intelligence is real rest assured after all many years ago I was also a member of the fragmented Dawn as soon as the words reached his ears y Wu was taken aback he passionately exclaimed you were once a member of the fragmented Dawn so your information must be absolutely true this is very important to me yo taiu was surprised by Yu's momentum exclaiming the pressure is truly terrifying although I had guessed that he would not simply Venture Into the Wilderness alone tonight I did not expect him to unleash such powerful strength at least above level 150 he smiled kindly reminding stay calm a hero must remain calm although I do not know what grievances you have with the fragmented Dawn my association with them was 20 years ago and I have no relation to them now taiu began to recount what he knew from the past about 30 years ago the fragmented Dawn was originally a major Force ranked fifth in the wilderness they were numerous and committed all sorts of evil Deeds at their most frenzy they even contemplated openly a line to attack the safe Zone taiu continued but when they were about to take actual action a man named muwe charged into the Outpost of the fragmented Dawn all by himself and with his sheer strength he destroyed the entire organization a lone Warrior stood there ready to face dozens even hundreds of others after that battle although the fragmented Dawn suffered severe losses and was no longer as strong as before their main forces either rebuilt new forces or joined other alliances nowadays only a small group carries the name of the fragmented Dawn but the era no longer belongs to them the fragmented Dawn is now just a dim shadow in the wilderness Yu thought of mui and quietly reflected it's him again the senior mu truly a mysterious hero then he opened his mouth to ask further do you know where they current Outpost is y taiu quickly replied I don't know as far as I know they do not have a fixed Outpost at this moment white appeared beside him to report Master the Spectrum shows normal it is not lining this report caused guu to sink into contemplation if the behavior of the fragmented Dawn is correct what is their purpose in attacking the Horizon combat team for money or is there someone behind directing them y continue to ask do you know if the people of the fragmented Dawn are using demonization to fight as soon as he finished speaking yel taiu was stunned demonization I didn't expect that this person has fallen to such a degree that he is willing to abandon his Humanity for power he continued it's truly pitiable then he tensely looked at Yu as if wanting to probe humans desire demonization the most effective method is the demonization drug but such substances are rare in the Wasteland if we could find a source for the drug we might be able to uncover it could it be that your purpose in coming to us is molissa y Wu immediately admitted that's right but unfortunately I didn't meet her when I went to her house earlier previously a centenarian highly esteemed in the town suddenly fell ill she needs a special medicine to recover therefore I entrusted M Lisa to go out and gather herbs currently she is the only pharmacist in the town and the town's people rely on her ye W was truly astonished 100 years old surviving in such a harsh environment is really surprising utai Zoo sadly continued yes I also hope she can continue living after all this settlement was established by her alone y taiu kept recounting the wonderful things about this girl although molisa has a peculiar temperament she often accepts some secret commissions to earn money deep down she is very kind-hearted always providing free medical care and Medicine to the town's people but then he shifted to another topic that aside since you are so actively inquiring about the intelligence of the fragmented Dawn could it be that they have wronged you in some way y Wu did not hide but directly said because my family is very likely to be kidnapped by them this mayor has been home for a while now comforting they really can do this kind of thing but the fortunate part in The Misfortune is that now they are acting as mercenaries so for the sake of money they won't easily kill people so your family must still be alive y taiu replied thank you for your kind words at this moment he simply intended to end the conversation it's getting late now how about you stay here tonight moisa should be back tomorrow then you can ask her y Wu agreed okay then I'll trouble you y taiu then called out to the door asking Sasa take y wo to the living room to rest she quickly appeared and obeyed okay Dad you you watched him prepare to leave and instructed get a good rest tonight tomorrow I still need your help to renovate that City wall Yu confirmed leave it to me I will definitely accomplish what I promised an and yose left together he looked at his daughter giving a sign of approval silently thinking this man I have checked is a highquality person rest assured I can confidently take action now the daughter turned around in surprise to look at him as if there was a spiritual connection between them yosa feeling flustered stepped forward and waved her hand saying dad what are you talking about I just met him for less than 2 hours however he still excitedly replied what's there to be shy about you are grown up now it's time to find a partner decides a good man like him once he leaves this Village there won't be another we have to leave some descendants for our family so I can hold my grandchild at that moment a shout came from behind ye W St startled and turned to look at him asking he what's wrong yosa hurriedly explained it's nothing really nothing I'll take you to your room but y wo remained suspicious and asked the system flying beside him a vis what are this father and daughter mumbling about do they want to sell me I V Vis did not hide it even showing a dangerous expression and replied selling is not quite the case but they are discussing how to make you their son ye W left feeling confused wondering what to do currently there are only 2 days left until the forced summoning of the Shadow King the next day the U Father and Son along with Yu went to The City Gate their appearance caused a stir in the town that kit is the engineer that the mayor invited that's right he's the one who fixed the water pump I heard he's a senior engineer no way how could he have such high skills at level 18 you don't understand he's obviously a prodigy from the sake Zone concealing his level is probably too easy for them Yo taiu turned to Yu and asked this city wall what level of attack can it withstand at most yiu thought for a moment and replied about level 60 since our concentrated area is relatively safe we haven't faced many highly threatening attacks with a level 60 defensive Beast it's still more than enough hearing this Mr yo suggested worriedly but after so many years the durab ility of this wall is nearing its limit therefore I hope you can reinforce it a bit Yu stood in front of the gate reached out and touched the surface feeling the Frailty within the wall he silently thought to himself indeed it is no longer sturdy yeu continued if it weren't for me it wouldn't have lasted through the next attack at that moment Machinery began to start up around them many devices flew up high using scanners to survey the entire gate the announcement sounded material analysis complete inject elements begin enhancement immediately a brilliant blue light emanated from the gate Illuminating the entire area everyone exclaimed in Surprise what is happening the wall is starting to Glow is this the power of a highlevel engineer ah my eyes are almost blinded after a long while the enhancement was completed the wall had reached a defense level of 100 cheers of Joy erupted incredible it's really like magic UT taiu stood by mouth a gape in amazement then said unbelievable even a high level engineer couldn't finish a level 100 Wall in such a short time could it be that you are a master yosa standing right next to him could not hide his astonishment either he comfortably put his arm around Yu's shoulder and spoke with deep appreciation y woo not only did you fix the water pump but you also improved the wall you have solved our two biggest survival problems you are truly a great benefactor of this town on behalf of all the people of concentration Zone 37 I sincerely thank you he continued speaking from now on you can consider this as your home in the wilderness no matter what request you have just let us know we will definitely support you wholeheartedly right girl sua exclaimed yes yes I will also support you with all my might however deep down she thought dad you are overextending yourself but I'm not mentally prepared yet just then a car driving down the road caught everyone's attention they murmured this car is indeed right on time she's back inside the car mola and the three men in the back seat were all injured each had an expression as if they had just lost their food rations when the car stopped yosa quickly walked up to greet her shell Mo you are finally back however Mo Lisa remains silent and walks straight past without saying a word leaving yaoa unnoticed feeling disheartened and standing there in confusion oh dear yo taiu observed Lisa's appearance and didn't say anything but he likely understood in his heart he could only sigh looking like this it seems the mission has failed life is unpredictable what should we do this time yiu attentively looked at her telling himself now is not the time to inquire about the Intel we can only wait and see molisa was on her way home from the gate her body trembling tears silently streaming down her cheeks she constantly regretted and blamed herself I'm sorry I'm sorry my dear I'm so useless in the small dilapidated house the sound of weeping echoed painfully Lisa knelt by the bed choked with emotion I'm sorry I couldn't find that medicine it's all my fault I'm so useless who moo I lay on the bed her pale face gently looking at the child beside her her voice was weak yet filled with love you silly child don't cry anymore you always take on responsibilities wanting to Bear everything alone you've been like this since you were little no matter how I say it you won't change she smiled softly her frail hand stroking Liz's head I have lived long enough living to 108 years in the wilderness is already a miracle moreover I was lucky to meet you my best disciple you are still young but have learned my skills looking at you I see the reflection of my younger self I have no regrets in my life anymore now you should go live the life you want leave this old woman behind two streams of Tears flowed down Lisa's face her eyes were heavy with sadness her voice choked no that can't be I'm still not good enough I still want to learn from you more please don't leave me she burst into tears her sobs resonating in the small space suddenly a strange voice voice interrupted am I apologize for disturbing you at this time you who stood at the door and asked I want to ask a little what medicinal herb do you need perhaps I have it Lisa angry turned around and scolded him who are you who let you in here I've never met you before get out yiu did not show any anger but remained silent then his face darken and his tone became cold who I am is not important what matters is that you are a pharmacist and you must be able to assess the situation clearly this person's condition has reached the most dangerous stage if she is not saved today she may not survive until tomorrow if she is truly important to you then do not worry about these details please tell me the name of the medicinal herb you were missing at this moment listen did not know how to refute him her brother lowered his head and desperately recounted I am missing a rare medicine called Cliff flower this flower only grows at the top of high mountain outside the cliffs but I have searched all the nearby mountain ranges and found nothing not even in the black market how about a stranger like you suddenly appear here and happen to have this medicinal herb he turned to the system and asked is there a cliff flower in the system's inventory the system pondered for a moment and then replied actually there is it was obtained from Li jasai before but there is only one plant very precious then you must want to take it he asked looking toward WS the old woman who was gasping for breath on the bed about to step into the door of death he said this is not the time to be stingy this is an opportunity to exchange information and Save a Life there is nothing to hesitate about he took out the cliff flower and happily asked isn't it a coincidence what do you think this is Lisa was stunned to see what she needed this is the cliff flow I can't be mistaken right how much do you need as long as you agree to sell I can pay any amount he handed the cliff flower to Lisa and said I don't need money I just need you to tell me a piece of information later but right now saving a life is the most important thing we will talk later could she believe her ears this Lisa bent down to the ground to express her gratitude thank you as long as you want to know I will definitely tell you everything I know thank you once again Lisa hurriedly ran off then I will go home to prepare the medicine first he felt a bit worried this Cliff flower belongs to a highlevel herb he continued a senior pharmacist is needed to successfully concoct the remedy with her rank can she do it well if it fails it would be a waste we must go check just as he stepped out the door moui lying on the hospital bed muttered a sentence that left him utterly astonished you have a very special scent on you unlike the smells of this world he turned back and asked are you talking about me but in response to his question came only strange words don't I don't need it looking at the old woman like that he wondered could this be a symptom of a serious illness talking nonsense in a coma it seems time is running out he quickly left the house deciding I must hurry there to prevent any unforeseen events from happening to her and also not to waste this precious medicine in the small house on a table covered with various types of medicine a large pot was boiling vigorously yosa feeling anxious asked what's the matter didn't sh Mo get the herbs she was focused on why haven't we started making the medicine Lisa rummaged through her bag this meanwhile yiu leaned against the door saying it seems my intuition wasn't wrong her level as a pharmacist is still not enough to successfully create the Cure yoso was astonished what Lisa felt helpless she shouted it's all because I didn't study medicine well now I only have a diploma as a pharmacy technician I know clearly that I only have this little qualification but I'm the only pharmacist in this town even though the failure rate is high I still have to try my best but I am still scared at that moment she suddenly realized something turned around and asked wait a minute not only did you immediately see my problem but you also brought such precious medicine could it be that you are also a pharmacist yoa next to her waved his hand he's not a pharmacist or anything he's an engineer he just finished repairing the water pump in the town yesterday and upgraded the city walls today although he's really good the two fields are as different as night and day if you want him to make medicine that won't work unexpectedly Yu admitted it's a coincidence I am also a pharmacist and my level is not low hearing that Lisa's eyes widened in Surprise what Lisa moved closer making y woo Flinch her body almost pressed up against him as she whispered the scent does not deceive people I believe you you are not lying yosa hurriedly intervened hey hey hey are you really going to let him do it although y wo is indeed very talented usually a person cannot Master many professional skills at the same time like that aren't you afraid of wasting the precious medicinal materials that are hard to come by she said the herbal medicine is also from yiu Lisa interrupted compared to my own ability to make medicine I trust my sense of smell more while the two were bickering Yu had completed everything he handed the medicine over and said it's done hurry and give it to the old lady to drink both were astonished their mouths of gape really is it done yosa feeling embarrassed scratched her head and mumbled it seems yiu is not an ordinary person after returning Lisa helped the old lady sit up and poured the medicine into her mouth feeling extremely joyful the the old lady's body began to emit a green light as if she was being healed yosa asked in Surprise is this medicine already effective the old lady gradually opened her eyes um this is Lisa joyfully embraced her unable to hold back her tears Grandma finally you woken up I was so afraid you would leave like this leaving me all alone the old lady smiled kindly Leisa you worry too much you are indeed my foolish child you who Stood Beside watching the scene and curiously asked you two were not just teacher and student but also have a familial relationship right yosel wiped her tears and replied yeah because she is not only cmo's teacher but also the one who found her in the wilderness and raised her she is her benefactor moo stared at the thing in Lisa's hand and finally realized the medicine in your hand if I'm not mistaken this is a Master Level Medicine Lisa didn't understand understand much about Master Level medicine but looking at the medicine map she could also see that it belonged to a very high level y Wu explained that's right the highlevel recipe you gave me actually had a few flaws the treatment effect was not optimal I made some adjustments to the ingredients and ratios of the medicine if the original recipe could help the elderly live for another year then with my improvements this time could be extended by at least 5 years upon hearing this everyone was astonished what yaa and liisa exclaimed in unison filled with surprise how could it be you you can even modify a high level prescription like that to be able to convert a high level medicine into a master level one means you are a Master Level pharmacist he stood there exceedingly dignified y's eyes lit up full of curiosity could it be that your engineering background is also Master Level you are a dual master in both engineering and Pharmacy y Wu lightly nodded as a form of tacit acknowledgement yosa could not hide her admiration but still wondered clearly you are so young how could you have accomplished this this is truly unimaginable could it be actually your age is quite large you just look very young yiu was at a loss for words and did not respond next to him moai quietly sat up muttering it's scenes this is also a destined fate Lisa worriedly supported the old lady grandma you just recovered don't push yourself the old lady became serious next I have something very important to say to this young man you all go outside first she questioned what is it that I can't know Grandma the old lady replied well it's a significant matter I can only talk about this privately with him Lisa grabbed yosa hand and said I understand yela let's go yosa responded okay before leaving yosa glanced that yo she told herself Dad was right an outstanding man like him is rare to encounter and if I miss this chance there will absolutely be no second time but do I deserve him moreover a person as exceptional as he probably already has someone in his heart now the room was left with just the two of them one old and one young Moi spoke thank you for saving me y woo although I once said I have lived enough the truth is I am still very afraid of death especially since I have lived to be 108 years old an old woman like me fears death even more the longer I live even though this world has long since Fallen apart I still want to welcome the new dawn with it y Wu had no aversion to this he calmly said fearing death is a common thing it's nothing to be ashamed of to face death and still remain calm is something not many can do the old lady chuckled at this ha you really know how to talk she continued I said that young people at your age can reach the Master Level it's truly rare thinking back it took me until I was 50 to barely break through y Wu then realize you were also a master pharmacist she smiled with her eyes squinting saying if I didn't have such abilities I wouldn't have been able to live in this Wilderness for 108 years compared to liisa my entire later life was dedicated to researching immortality it's quite selfish isn't it ywu shook his head and replied people do not think of themselves and the heavens and earth will perish moreover in this apocalyptic era who doesn't think a bit more about themselves people like you living a little longer is a blessing for this town you must know a master pharmacist is someone whom even big corporations are willing to invest in to recruit hearing this she laughed heartily haha young people like you are truly interesting over the years I've only met two people like you Yu curiously asked so who is the other one she wondered for a moment before answering he is similar to you also from the safe Zone perhaps you've heard of his name yiu smiled faintly muw why is there a guy like that everywhere Master Mo he also did not hide anything mu is a legendary classmate of our school what did he do back then that made you remember so clearly she recalled back then he was nearly the same age as you but compared to you he was much more enthusiastic and impulsive often doing unpredictable things he once single-handedly eliminated the fragmented Dawn but was also seriously injured nearly losing his breath it was difficult for me to save him in the end that guy wrote an IOU and ran away it really made me Furious yiu said indeed a strange person does strange things but the one who kept me here for a private conversation surely has other motives Beyond these past stories on the surface he seems ordinary but thinks differently I did didn't expect you to be someone like that mui chuckled inside old folks like me enjoy reminiscing about the past with others but I don't have any other intentions just following the guidance of Fate whan to pass a few things to you hearing this his eyes brightened really but if it's money I don't need it right now I'm not lacking in money she laughed haha indeed a straightforward child she took out a glowing scroll the longer one lives the more One Believes In the arangements of Fate she continued before I die you save me just when you are a Master Level pharmacist I believe this is the guidance of Fate wanting me to entrust this blueprint to you this is resurrection consisting of longevity fruit Brokenness Crown Supreme Aura and immortality if the required ingredients are properly combined it will create Resurrection upon hearing this he was greatly excited is this a godlevel potion recipe may I ask so a precious blueprint how did you come to possess it do you really want to give it to me the serious expression on her face replied that's a tale from long ago I don't remember it clearly the only thing I can say is that the difficulty of crafting this potion is very high it seems that with human intelligence it is difficult to comprehend it even with the skills of a Master Level pharmacist I have not been able to grasp the method of creation for many years not to mention those rare materials I have never even heard of them ye woo carefully analyzed and said no wonder it is a god-level potion all the necessary materials are of divine level but where can I find the other three Divine ingredients besides the longevity fruit which fell from the life Forest dungeon I have absolutely no idea not to mention the drop rates at least with this blueprint there is still hope no matter how much effort it takes I will strive to collect the other materials this is resurrection after all ye Wu continued adds for the difficulty in creating something that is hard for human intellect to grasp as she mentioned I can use the all powerful omniscient drug made from the material of the intellect to overcome it although the process will surely be very long I now have a clear Direction the old woman saw him so engrossed and couldn't help but smile you seem quite confident entrusting this blueprint to you is indeed the right choice I hope that this Divine level blueprint in your hands will bear fruit am talking so much makes me feel sleepy you should go find l since you've helped her I assume there's something you need her for right hurry along Yu nodded stood up all right then you should rest she looked at him pondering although your personality is completely different from mu ways both of you are filled with ambition and striving to change this world it can only rely on young people like you as an old woman who has crossed the threshold of the underworld once my survival is but a distant hope I hope you can let me witness the day this world changes Yu wo also had his own thoughts this old woman surely has many Secrets but now is not the time to ask I'll find the opportunity to inquire more slowly later suddenly Lisa's voice rang out vwoo you're out Lisa anxiously asked Master how is she let me check on her he stopped her saying she's asleep now it's best not to disturb her besides I ask something I want to ask you Lisa's eyes lit up and she proudly patted her chest go ahead since you helped me with such a big matter anything I know I will definitely tell you he recounted the situation and after listening Lisa pondered so that's how it is you asked the right person not long ago I just received a commission to buy items for the fragmented Dawn he curiously asked are you making demonization drugs for them Lisa angrily retorted what are you thinking I still have some limits besides how could I possibly make that kind of thing she became serious but I have a rough idea of who supplied the demonization drugs to the fragmented Dawn as long as we find them we won't have to worry about not being able to find the people from the fragmented Dawn he was excited who are they Lisa was silent for a moment before answering they are called The Desperate poison Society with a very notorious reputation in the Wasteland y wo after hearing this pondered and said desperate poison Society just hearing the name feels like a villainous organization yet this name carries a strange feeling as if it sees through something she quickly replied it's not convenient to talk about it here let's discuss it at my house she turned to yosa beside her and instructed SAA you should go home first don't keep Uncle worried after being out for so long yosa smiled and said all right then it seems like you all have important matters to discuss I won't disturb you any longer goodbye now seated at the table they began their conversation Yu spoke up first can we talk in detail about the desperate poison Society now Lisa didn't keep him waiting long quickly explaining the desperate poison society as the ominous name suggests consist of members who are Reckless and frenzy in their organization the main characteristic of this organization is that it only accepts pharmacists moreover the minimum requirement is to be at least a mid-level she thought of a woman with white hair and large Wings behind her then continued these people gathered together to accumulate wealth by trading various potent poisons however making money is merely a means to achieve their ultimate goal Yu ask curiously what is their ultimate goal Lisa slowly said her eyes filled with disgust it is to transform all living beings in this world into the forms they desire to accomplish this they have used demon beasts as subjects for experimentation most of the products like demonization drugs are the results of these studies at this point he immediately asked earlier you mentioned that they only accept pharmacists from intermediate level and above does that include Master's level as well Lisa continued to explain their leader is a Master Level pharmacist besides her there are many other highlevel pharmacists in this organization they act modestly and rarely show their faces only a few people from major forces or those who have Cooperative relationships chicks with them know of their existence a group of oddballs like that when gathered together even in a powerful Wilderness no one dares to provoke them otherwise no one knows what strange things might appear in the country the next day yiu raised his hand to cover his mouth quietly thinking I didn't expect there to be such an organization in the wilderness I've only been in the wilderness for a few days but I already feel my perspective has been refreshed many times previously I truly had a shallow understanding but if that organization is made up entirely of Pharmacists he told himself perhaps I will have a chance he happily clenched his fist envisioning an exciting scenario surely there are many Blueprints and materials there if I can find their base won't I strike it rich seeing his expression Lisa felt a bit puzzled she thought to herself clearly I am speaking seriously yet why is he so excited Yi wo was still thinking about a few things in his mind no no the important thing now is to find the key Clues I will think about these things later then he spoke up if this organization is so mysterious how do you know so much could it be that you are also a member of the desperate poison Society Lisa nervously retorted oh my I am completely different from those unethical poison Masters the reason I know so much is that I have a friend who is a regular supplier of medicinal materials for the desperate poison Society yiwu said seriously I am a cautious person and I approach everything with a skeptical attitude Lisa lowered her voice I'm sorry Yu continued that also means if we can find your friend and use his connections to infiltrate the desperate poison Society then we can inquire about information regarding the fragmented Dawn can you take me and meet him now upon hearing this Lisa hesitated a bit stuttering uh about this Yu noticed her hesitation and asked what wrong is there a problem Lisa clasped her hands in front of her stomach and sent with difficulty no no problem at all since you're helping me with something so big I have to overcome this little difficulty saying that Lisa ran out of the house calling back as she went I will go make arrangements first let's meet in front of the town in 10 minutes upon hearing this Anne agreed okay Yi Wu thought to himself her expression seems to indicate there's something difficult to say is there something going on between her and that acquaintance at this moment both of them had arrived at the town's gate yosa put a large bag of supplies in the back of the car and said lwu this is the dry food for you to eat on the way yuk taiu beside her also spoke up since you're going to rescue someone I won't hold you any longer I wish you success he waved goodbye to them and said thank you well I'm leaving first goodbye Lisa was already sitting in the car looking at him and smiling sesa seems very concerned about you you two have just met not long ago you who looked at her and replied it's a long story drive the car began to roll away the two people left behind were still quite enthusiastic waving their hands and saying drive safely yosel wiped her tears and said to her father dad am my heartbroken now Tido laughed heartily silly girl your youth has just begun after some time they arrived at the company he spoke first opening the company in this Wilderness your acquaintance must have some capability hearing this she replied it's just a pharmacy as long as one's heart is dark enough who can't make money but the price of this guy is higher than the average market price and everyone is willing to buy from him including me y wo helplessly thought to himself no matter what this name sounds poisonous at first glance it also reminds me of an old song that goes red pole white pillar after eating just lay flat as the car approached the company gate a man stepped out to block the way he spoke up oh isn't this m Mo what wind brought you here today quite rare indeed Lisa sat in the car impatiently shouted I need to see your boss let me through hearing that he immediately ordered all right then quickly rais the barriers don't keep the boss and Miz MO waiting an underling promptly opened the way leading the car ahead he replied succinctly understood y Wu turned to Lisa curious and asked I'm increasingly wondering what your relationship with the boss here is if you were just ordinary friends those guards wouldn't need to be so respectful Lisa sighed and softly replied you'll find out soon enough upon arrival one of the underlings opened the car door and bowed his head saying ladies please come in as they stepped inside Yu looked around unable to hide his astonishment ah this is Lisa standing beside him laughed and said surprised AR you the first time I came here my reaction was no different from yours ye woo furrowed his brows and then said oh I think I figured out what kind of person the boss here is deep inside a man was waiting seeing the two of them arrive he shouted oh Lisa you finally came clearly I'd contacted you countless times before without a response yet today you took the initiative to come this means he paused his face very smug then continued you finally agreed to marry me right he was madei and upon hearing this Yu's expression immediately turned unpleasant what Lisa standing beside him seemed unconcerned and replied kurtley don't go crazy on me I'm looking for you about something else mque jumped down from upstairs muttering denying in every way no after a bit of fetc he suddenly stopped looking directly at Lisa no need to hide your feelings anymore just open your heart and jump into my arms M's actions made Lisa a little scared he leaped down in front of her causing her to instinctively step back she raised her hand and slapped him hard across the face then gruffly said what the hell are you losing your mind about in broad daylight I've told you countless times I have zero interest in humans though slapped m still clasped his hands together mouth a gate face full of joy ah is this the feeling of love he ran his fingers through his blonde hair speaking gently no matter whether you like humans or not it doesn't matter as long as I like you that's enough my love for you Heaven and Earth bear witness Lisa went crazy and shouted loudly can't you understand human language yiu Stood Beside her bewildered think thinking to himself isn't this a bit too much information mque boldly stepped forward grabbed Lisa's chin and said in a seductive Tone If you really weren't interested in me why did you come looking for me surely you need my help right Lisa grimaced pushed his hand away and responded get your pig hand off me yes and so what I want you to inquire about the Fright Meed Dawn through the desperate poison Society hearing this he calmly replied so that's it no need to go through all that trouble with my intelligence Network I already know quite a bit about the fragmented Dawn M turned and walked away continuing to speak about recent events they not only crushed The Horizon combat team that was just recovering but also kidnapped quite a few people from that team it seems he turned his head back grinning wickedly and added including the family members of The Mastermind behind the Horizon combat team I Vis besides y Wu gently reminded him Master this guy is not lying upon hearing this yiwu's Aura surged as he stepped forward in his mind he thought so yanf has really been kidnapped the fragmented Dawn I will definitely tear you apart with my own hands Yu's face darkened as he stepped closer to him and said if you know so much you must know where to find the fragmented Dawn tell me their address mque crossed his arms looking arrogant and replied slowly slowly are you angry it seems you are someone important of course I know how to find them but I have a condition he pointed at Lisa and demanded as long as Lisa agrees to marry me I will tell you Lisa was taken AB back and asked what did you just say mque stepped closer to her smirking with your personality you wouldn't outright deny or refute is this man very important to you that makes me a bit jealous but as long as you agreed to me what are those feelings worth Lisa annoyed shouted you bastard yugu stepped in front of her raising a hand to stop her and calmly said you don't need to pay attention to such unreasonable demands moreover I am not the type of person who uses favors to force others to do something against their will Lisa called out to Yu from behind he exuded an overwhelming Aura put his hands in his pockets and approached mque coldly saying as long as it's confirmed that he has the information I need I have countless ways to make him talk M saw y Wu approaching and shouted are you in such a hurry to die someone kill this man for me his subordinates immediately aimed their guns at y Wu and Lisa Yu looked around and calmly said is this all there is Lisa spread her arms to protect y wo and shouted stop don't harm YW she said solemly you don't need to oppose them because of me Yu I understand the pain of losing loved ones very well as long as I can repay your kindness what is a little sacrifice mque was taken aback and asked loudly what has this man done that makes you willing to do this for him Lisa coldly smiled and replied what you has done for me you will never be able to do in this lifetime no me for you to know he joyfully shouted it's fine no matter if you hit me or use words to provoke me my love for you will never waver I viz chuckled Softly and commented though it's hard to believe this guy's spectrum color is the truest pink of love y Wu helplessly responded a lovic man is indeed the most deadly he raised his hand looked at Lisa and said seriously I know you were thinking of me but this kind of repayment and sacrifice against your own will is truly unnecessary therefore I oppose this marriage he was Furious shouting we are a perfect match a pair made in heaven how dare a kid like you oppose us I've never liked you anyway although I spared your life for Lisa's sake if I don't beat you up I won't be able to relieve the hatred in my heart he ordered his subordinates get him beat that Nave character hard the subordinates replied understood senior this guy dares to cause trouble in our territory he must be tired of living seeing this Lisa wanted to rush in why woo before she could do anything M cubbed her waist and pulled her back don't worry I won't take his life before he loses Consciousness he will reveal the information I want after all I am a man of my word Yu Stood Still but his rage radiated like shock waves enough to make the subordinates collapse on the spot the screams echoed he sarcastically prays I didn't expect you to be such a principal person mque was astonished shouting one move to wipe out the elite team beside me Yu stepped closer his cold voice is ringing out just so happens I am also very principled so I will spare you a life plus one mouth he stepped back stammering don't don't get too cocky even if my men can't subdue you I still have ways to kill you may de threw a few vials containing poison towards y wo loudly proclaiming try the specially crafted poison of mine just a single drop is enough to kill you instantly don't underestimate a high level pharmacist like me however before the poison could get close to ywu he intercepted it m Furious shouted what my poison is so easily dissipated at that moment several henchmen arrived shooting while shouting senior we're here to assist what exactly is happening here mque saw them and yelled stop talking nonsense quickly eliminate this guy for me the henchmen responded in unison yes they continued their assault but once again several bullets were intercepted before they could even touch Yu yiu smiled his tone full of mockery is this all the skill you have to DARE open a company in the wilderness how can you survive relying only on numbers he continued to use his techniques shattering everything around him Lisa who stood nearby was also affected having to raise her hands to Shield herself she couldn't help but be astonished at this overwhelming power I can't believe it Lisa thought to herself this ye is not only a pharmacist Master but also an expert engineer moreover his combat strength is frighteningly strong How can there be such a person in this world mque stood in front of Lisa blocking some of the influence and kindly advised are you okay Lisa at this point I'm the man to save you from the explosion Lisa shouted with disdain stop being so self-indulgent even without you yiu wouldn't hurt me yiu put his hands in his pockets his eyes filled with killing intent he sneered facing overwhelming power and not running away and even stepping in front of Lisa your level of infatuation truly surprises me m gritted his teeth and retorted nonsense if I were so cowardly as to let the woman I love get harmed what kind of man would I be I must defeat you he took out a vial of medicine drinking it while gring his teeth were you Lisa I'll temporarily abandon my Humanity immediately his body transformed into a gigantic lion roaring fiercely you can force me into this form and you will die a terrible death hemp you are no exception Lisa seeing this turned to ywu her voice full of worry is this the mysterious form from the rumors mque used it to defeat many competitors winning the drug Supply contract for the desperate poison Society yiwu stared intently at the monster before him cautiously preparing for battle just then a voice rang out boom and a figure staggered into view hovering above his head were several Stars circling around mque who had just been struck by a devastating blow he knelt before yo crying and stammering I'm sorry I was wrong who she looked at the scene before her unable to Hive her surprise letting out an audible gas Yu stepped forward pinching his ear and lifting him up laughing and saying so this is the reason you like molissa even the demon beast in transformation has to turn into this furry creature he was lifted up in so much pain that he cried out it hurts it hurts so much yiu continued that's right I have no resistance to the furry type while Lisa is the only existence I've ever encountered being with her is my lifelong dream hearing this Lisa angrily charged over and kicked him in the head get lost so you do crave her body huh he screamed in pain no that that's not it I really like you he looked at them sighing silently thinking to himself the only one I'm also very curious about mola's cat ears at first I thought it was just a style choice but now looking closely it seems she really has them attached could she be non-human at this moment yiu coldly spoke up all right we should return to the main issue tell me everything you know about the fragmented Dawn M [ __ ] heard this and quickly replied all right I will tell you everything I Know M knelt down and continued in reality the fragmented Dawn is now just a tool every move they make is under the direction of someone else if you are intent on finding a way to break the fragmented Dawn you will absolutely not uncover anything in the end Yu looked down and interrogated souu is The Mastermind directing the fragmented Dawn M immediately replied it's the wuji group yiu curiously asked who is this wui group Lisa crossed her arms and explained After all you've only been in the wild for a few days so it's normal not to have heard of them but for those of us living in the wild the name Muji group is well known they are the biggest and most terrifying evil force in zone c100 no one in the area dares to confront them hearing this yiu immediately asked with such a large influence why would they mess with the Horizon combat team could it be that there's a Grudge mque looked at Lisa and continued it's not that there's a grudge it's rumored that this matter is related to the death of hor Lisa turned to ask horu is dead when did this happen Yu recall past events thinking to himself 1 million before wasn't I able to get it for free m continued not long ago horu Yuan and Yea were hired by the Huang Jen group to kill someone I forget the name but none of the three teams survived he couldn't help but Wonder but what does this have to do with the wui group upon hearing this he quickly replied the manner of death of those three teens was not only extremely tragic but also resembled the person that the wui group was searching for M continued the one who killed them was Lorn y Wu upon hearing this gasped and shouted what the cold eyes of the Chinese individuals turned towards the Intruder ye woo immediately question ancient god Lorn could it be that the wui group is also a follower of the ancient god like the ancient Lord's Advent Society mque explained the leader of the wui group is an agnostic he worships power and looks down on faith therefore it is very likely that he is only interested in the power of the ancient god the wuji group became the largest force in area 100 also relates to the guidelines set by this leader in building his team he likes to collect various forms of ancient mystical power and attract those with special abilities as long as they have a specialty they would not refuse he continued although the reward that wui group has offered to the Horizon combat team this time is not high the actions of the fragmented Dawn are extremely proactive this must be a way to show loyalty yiu was Furious shouting the fragmented Dawn and wuji group you have messed with the wrong person Lisa beside him hurriedly advised V woo please calm down a bit M chimed in great God quickly rein in Your Divine Powers otherwise my crumbling building will collapse Yi Wu restrained his anger saying sorry I couldn't control my emotions for a moment mayi wiped the sweat off his forehead responding it's all right I completely understand your feelings but don't worry too much your family is definitely safe inside y Wu was over overwhelmed with emotions he had confirmed that the one behind the Horizon combat team is the true boss not only does he possess extraordinary strength but he is also very likely to have the power of an ancient god people like that cannot be provoked mque solemnly continued the type of Reckless and Ruthless People like the fragmented dong will usually leave no one alive let alone take hostages if they choose to capture your family this time it must be to lure the true boss out this means means that as long as you don't fall into their trap they will not harm your family yiu smiled and said isn't it just the right time I want to dive into the net as well just give me the location of the wui group's base mque agreed all right no problem compared to underground places like the fragmented Dawn the wui group's base is more fixed after all they are a large force with over 10,000 people cage City also known as the wui group's base is a large stronghold about 1,000 km to the east it occupies four safe zones from the southwest to the Northeast located right on the main safe road regardless of whether you are an individual or a company anyone wanting to reach the large area in the East must pay a toll to Chang kwin if not they can only take a smaller dangerous detour and explore on their own yiu rested his chin on his hand thought for a moment and said is the wui group really that dominant even large corporations in the safe Zone don't seem to matter yet they dare to charge them a toll M nodded that's right because the wui group has an overall strength comparable to that of the large corporations battalions for example Wang Jang is currently cooperating with them therefore it's best not to confront the wui group whatever they want just give it to them after all life is more important than anything else y Wu closed his eyes to ponder M hurriedly waved his hands to to explain of course I don't mean to belittle you although you are very strong it is nonetheless difficult for one person to contend against a large group they are familiar with the Wilderness terrain and have the advantage of home turf if it comes to direct confrontation winning against them is nearly impossible instead of making a big deal out of it wouldn't it be better to turn a big issue into a small one and a small issue into nothing at all Yi Wu coldly replied all right I understand how you think but that does not suit me the matter of the wui group is something I will handle myself now tell me how can I find the fragmented Dawn mque answered typically there is only one way for them to come to you you can't actively find them but I have a way a lure them out they usually take on High level missions commonly requiring payment upfront before they start I will set a price that they cannot refuse and then Yu continued I will pay this amount 50 million is that enough molisa gassed and shouted 50 million you woo are you that wealthy could it be that you were the hair of a large corporation in the safe Zone M was also astonished I originally planned to say 8 million would be enough I didn't expect you to immediately offer 50 million this amount is almost a quarter of the annual revenue of my four companies YW sent calmly don't talk about 50 million as long as it can lure those people out I'd spend a billion without hesitation anyone who who dares to harm my family and friends shouldn't expect to survive mol Lisa and mque nodded in agreement their expressions deep and thought the feeling of Oppression is too strong yuu looked at the system panel calculating in his heart but the forced timing of the Shadow King world is coming soon the Urgent thing is to adjust the Strategic Focus immediately the top priority is to prepare well for that world right now at the drug base There's an opportunity to replenish the medicine otherwise as soon as it's transmitted back those three mysterious highlevel beings will open the door and kill us he turned to M and asked do you have powerful attack medicine I need it urgently M responded immediately without hesitation of course I have some he L Yu to a room and opened the door I don't have good medicine to save people but it's the Insidious cruel attack types then I have plenty almost every type is sufficient as the door opened inside reveal large shelves filled with vials of various colors M pointed at the shelves introducing these are what I've collected feel free to take also there are some other types in the warehouse later I'll take you to choose these things are all collected by me you can take them as for the other things in the warehouse I will take you to choose later yiu said with satisfaction all right I want to buy in bulk please give me a 50% discount Yu propose Lisa standing beside spoke up in confusion why are you still paying even if you have a lot of money you shouldn't waste it like that his life and death are in your hands just take what you want no need to be polite yiu smiled raised his hand and said business is business I defeated him based on my strength not by using Force to coer forcing and robbing is just a momentary action instead I prefer a mutually beneficial cooperation which is more sustainable this is also my life philosophy so you want to cooperate with me mayi laughed happily and shook hands with Y woo Vision this is exactly Vision I have been in business for many years and have never met anyone with such generous and Progressive thinking as you rest assured I will definitely bring all the good Goods to you y Wu instructed especially the Master Level poison please try to get me a lot of it mque replied I don't have many finished master level poisons but I have plenty of blueprints it's just that if there's no one to manufacture them it would be useless Lisa interjected from behind who do you think you're talking to yiu is a Master Level pharmacist mque exclaimed in Surprise What Not only is he strong wealthy but he is also a Master Level pharmacist moreover he is handsome is there any man in this world more perfect than him y woo urged stop the flattery let's get to work mque obediently followed his order after a while the system notified you have received Epic Level poison item one freia perfume when used it causes nearby enemies to enter a frenzy State lasting 3,000 turns indiscriminate of species or gender item two theery bubbles for all enemies in the Target area they will fall into a frenzy State increasing their attack power but not distinguishing between allies and foes every second will incur a loss of Sanity lasting 1 minute if the countdown ends before time is up and Sanity does not return the person will instantly die item three Scarlet Wales when used the target will enter a state of wild dancing until their life ends yiu was taken back contemplating what kind of poison is this but I must say it seems to have some effect system notification forc teleportation in 5 minutes ye continued to ponder only 5 minutes left just then Lisa suddenly opened the door and entered asking D woo you called me here privately is there something important you want to discuss Yi Wu replied um after thinking for a while I feel that there are a few things I should clarify with you for the better that day Lisa unexpectedly asked are you saying that in the virtual space of Wong Jen that day the whole new two I encountered was actually you y Wu answered that's right Lisa question so you came here to demand back that 1 million y Wu refuted I have no such intention y Wu explained everything my actions have drawn you into my personal matters if I let you participate with a mindset of repayment I would feel very guilty at the very least you should know the cause and effect to understand that my appearance at your home was not a coincidence upon hearing this Lisa smiled is that thank you for being straightforward with me but this small matter doesn't need to be concerned about compared to that I worry more about you she frowned because you used the power of the god to kill lol meu and his men now you are being targeted this reminds me of what my grandmother used to tell me she said that the power of the ancient gods is a sign of evil a type of cursed power that Humanity should not touch in history anyone who sought to control the ancient gods ultimately had to face ter terrible consequences therefore I am worried that this power of the ancient gods might have a negative impact on you right she said this time your family encountered Misfortune is there any possibility that it is related to the curse of the ancient gods you w felt this was quite reasonable perhaps this possibility could not be ruled out he pondered even knowing about the ancient gods that old person is indeed not simple after handling this matter I must return to find her to ask for clarity the system announced Mr lie requests to contact you Yi Wu answered the call Mr lie finally reached out does Ling Yuan have new movements y Wu asked Mr lie replied in a panicked voice it's not good Master Ling Yuan may be about to find Guang xen she is contacting suddenly the system cut off the connection the signal was interrupted an alarm sounded commencing force transfer of the master to the Shadow King World his surroundings began to change in the unfamiliar scene y Wu exclaimed in Anger at such a crucial moment why is this happening he was teleported to a place full of monsters Laguna was trying to fend them off and turned around shouting vwy quickly grasping the situation yiu realized he had returned just before the curse was cast he looked at Laguna and silently said I'm sorry Miss Christina suddenly a vile flew towards the Beast it was taken by surprise asking blankly what is this the Beast became frantic dancing wildly YW recognize that it was the effect of scarlet Waltz causing the target to enter a state of uncontrolled dance until the moment of his death Yi Wu urged lagona who was gaping at the incomprehensible situation don't just stand there hurry up Laguna asked is it because of the vial of poison you just threw yiu seized his hand and pulled him along while explaining that's right this is a type of mental toxin anyone who contacts it will dance uncontrollably until they exhaust themselves to death the Beast creatures seeing their comrade hit by the poison began to discuss what kind of poison is it is there an antidote another one said it's impossible to determine the type of poison there's no way to cure it in a short time The Poisoned individual panicking pleaded what do you want to do please save me the other two replied in unison we vow to protect your soul then they cut their poison comrade in half the poison one screamed in pain before collapsing Laguna witnessing that scene couldn't help but feel horrified exclaiming they even kill their own kind it's terrifying y Wu showing no surprise calmly said when it comes to evil cultists don't use the standards of ordinary people to judge they are about to catch up lagona side so quick they are almost upon us in the blink of an eye damn it suddenly Yu stopped Laguna anxiously asked what is it are you planning to risk your life against them but the power difference is too great we have no chance of winning she turned back to look and to her surprise the pursuers are also motionless their posture somewhat strange y Wu slowly approached the two creatures and said of course because they have stepped into the Trap that I set beneath your feet is a layer of water net laced with a extremely potent poison that I just sprinkled free at Perfume manto even with a thick layer of shoes the toxins can quickly infiltrate the body as soon as Yi Wu finished speaking the two monsters naturally rushed to kiss each other passionately Yi Wu further explained the free of perfume puts nearby enemies into a state of Enchantment and loss of sanity this effect lasts for about 3,000 moves ensuring no distinction between gender or race laguma exclaimed in astonishment oh my this smell is really unpleasant but you woo I wonder how you got such a strange poison did you really create it all by yourself Yu replied that's a long story now we must seize the opportunity to deal with them Laguna still looked worried but their personas are far superior to ours I suspect that even if we strike them it would feel like just a breeze on the skin YW reassured him by tossing out a purple vial and said this is simple while they're off guard reduce their defense significantly no matter how thick the blood is it won't save them move forward don't forget to switch weapons seeing the intimate scene of the two monsters lagona couldn't help but vomit the vial that y woo threw at them immediately took effect this was a lethal poison breaking their armor causing the enemies to become poisoned and reducing their defense by 50% while losing blood however this effect only lasts for about 1 minute lagona shouted charge go die a group of people fell to the ground the system announced received 300,000 experience points Laguna was astonished to see his level rise five times in a row he wondered what level are these people without the armor breaking potions I don't know how long it would take me to conquer them Yu smiled and replied this is the benefit of killing monsters above your level Laguna picked up the dropped items and suddenly noticed the key he curiously asked what is this key for the system immediately displayed the information Ling way City key to the Sewer ye woo inquired what's up with this key does it have any origin Laguna thought and explained Ling White City is the second largest city in this country and it is also where the plague broke out now the entire city has turned into a dead City filled with mutated beings the King has ordered the blockade of all entrances and exits to the city but the appearance of this key indicates that someone can enter and exit freely it is very likely that the organization behind the plague has created it the system announced current progress of the main quest is 12% when it reaches 20% players will be able to return to reality Yu pondered just one key can increase the quest progress by 2% it seems very important he said lingy city is definitely the important main quest as long as we continue to push along this line we might might quickly reach 20% however I have a feeling that there are definitely highlevel Elite Monsters Everywhere in Ling way City I'm too familiar with this tactic already at this moment the three black clad Figures were indeed the minor bosses advising players to retreat while reminding them that the main quest location behind had an extremely high difficulty level they needed to upgrade quickly therefore Ling way city was certainly a highlevel and extremely dangerous dungeon with my current AL IAL support account I was afraid that I would be killed as soon as I entered therefore Laguna's upgrade was the most important thing Yu's expression changed looking serious Laguna kill it Laguna was startled her face pale V woo what are you doing your expression is so strange y woo grinned slightly moving closer be good listen to me just absorb this and you can be the strongest in the world Laguna quickly intervened wait y wo don't I don't understand what you're talking about what is this ywu stopped and said don't you know how to absorb magic crystals Laguna shook her head and replied no I'd never seen this before Yu thought to himself so magic crystals are a specialty of our world under the campfire light ywu slowly explained all right let me teach you first do it this way then do it that way Laguna seemed help helpless looking like he understood yet also as if he didn't understand anything at all after a while the two Sat facing each other across the fire Yi Wu reminded him in general just give it a try first although it might be a bit glaring try to focus on the location you mentioned earlier laguma closed his eyes gripping the gem tightly concentrating on Gathering his power then he sigh helplessly I can't do it even if I put all my effort in I still can't sink my power with the strength within the metan Yi Wu pondered could it be that the power of the magic Crystal isn't compatible with this world if that's the case then this upgrade path is not feasible it's quite a headache I must think of a way to overcome this obstacle he stood up looked at Laguna and said you just keep the magic Crystal whenever you have time take it out and try to absorb its power Laguna nodded in agreement Yi Wu continued originally I intended to find another way but for now we have to work hard on leveling up so if you want to level up quickly what method do you usually choose Luna replied if I want to level up quickly I can only go fight monsters or take on High level quests Yu immediately made a plan then let's start with highlevel quests we must level up quickly otherwise if we encounter enemies like last time it will be the end for us Luna responded then curiously asked I understand understand but actually your true purpose is to scout Ling way City isn't it y wo asked again did you figure this out too Laguna speculated if not sooner you wouldn't be in such a hurry to upgrade since I got the key based on your expression you've always been very serious Yu pra you are very observant Yu pondered compared to Ling way C I worry more about the safety of my family alow time there is temporarily pause no matter what I hope to rescue them as soon as possible so I'm sorry Laguna for your matters here I have to forcefully speed up the progress lagona lay back inside then let me sleep for a night and tomorrow morning I'll go take the mission Yu was angry sleep you still want to sleep with that serious face ping pressure on us how can you sleep at this level I can't sleep at this level how can you Laguna cried and pleaded don't say anymore don't say anymore can't I just go take the mission at the mission reception a person with purple hair greeted them Yo you two are back want to drink again tonight ye we declined another time I'm here to take the mission today the purple-haired person warned why so serious but hey the difficulty of last night's Mission has doubled think carefully don't go throwing your life away two people approached the mission board Laguna pondered M there are quite a few level 30 missions Yu interjected don't look anymore those low-level missions aren't interesting he held up a mission paper if you want to do it let's take on a level 60 Mission Laguna exclaimed what y woo this is a regular level 60 Mission I'm not cowardly but this is an elite level 60 Mission not only does it require a team of five but the average level needed is around level 50 this is way out of our league how about we change the difficulty for the rewards yumu held up the paper and replied this is easy saying that he loudly called out everyone here is there anyone who wants to team up with us to take on this Mission Laguna felt a bit anxious and said there probably isn't anyone right now suddenly a bald guy laughed mockingly what are you joking about only a fool would go with you we can drink together but teaming up to throw our lives away is a no-o a pink-haired guy raised his beer mug and spoke up your levels are too low don't even think about that Elite level 6 Mission anymore I advise you to go take a shower and get some sleep don't think too hard Yu replied I was originally planning to take you guys out for some meat if you refuse don't blame me later let's go Laguna saying that y w turned and walked out the door at that moment Laguna spoke wait for me ywo the orange-haired guy looked at Yo's back and sneered sure just remember to remind us to go clean up the corpses for you later haha the skinny guy in the cloak chimed in senior they've taken on that mission already the fat cloaked guy added do we need to follow them the senior replied don't be Hasty let's go later tonight that Yu guy isn't the showy type we should be cautious of him Elite Mission recommended level level 50 number of participants five objective eliminate 15 mutated beasts outside rescue 10 evil people and save the mass special Mission obtain the book of blood there stood a gloy castle beneath the Blazing Red Sky in front of the castle were long rows of grave markers yiu stopped his horse and gazed at the castle then said magnificent just looking at it you could tell this architecture is certainly not simple Laguna what do you think Laguna also halted his horse responding I dare not look you who continued don't be so fearful look at the mission introduction we can base our choices on the difficulty level to pick the easier ones right we certainly don't have to do them all Laguna sat on a stone his expression anxious I'm not a coward but this Elite Mission at level 60 is too far out of our reach standing before this Gap i' see no hope at all so I have no fighting Spirit left Yu replied of course I know you because of this the two of them were currently peeking behind a large pillar looking inside yiu smiled and said so let's start with the simplest task how can you know if you don't try Laguna shook his head protesting you mean to eliminate 15 mutated beasts in the Outer Circle oh my God is this really the simplest task clearly they're all Elite monsters and there are so many of them how can we fight Yi Wu responded irritably don't be cowardly use my method what's the difference for elite monsters just do as I say in the distance many mutated wind beasts of varying levels were moving back and forth one mutated Beast approached lagona causing him to panic and Shout what there are operational methods like this can we actually do this yiu smiled confidently trust me a sudden noise rang out yiu was startled and asked huh is it starting already he quickly threw his sword forward and said loudly no matter how tense the battle gets I unconditionally trust you the SW pierced straight into the head a mutated beast making it bleed and scream in pain yiu hid behind the pillar staring intently at the Beast then softly called come here the mutated wind Beast growled and charged straight at them Laguna anxiously voiced can we really pull just one Beast like this Yu replied Don't Panic wait until it completely appears behind the tomstone then he threw out a highle Holy Light potion while Laguna quickly th thrust her sword into the body of the mutated evil person the mutated evil person screamed in pain at this moment lagona observed several monsters lined up in two rows she said it seems they are patrolling back and forth that's great we won't disturb the others this way we can lure them one by one to deal with them a little at a time your Technique is really impressive y Wu held the potion in his hand and smiled smugly he replied of course I invested a lot of money into this can't be useless in front of the castle swallows fluttered about the sound of their wings mingling with the sound of the wind a voice called out from afar what does investing money mean is it the currency in your country yiu laughed the explanation would be long let's skip it keep pulling the monsters tonight will still be long another mutated evil person fell the soul leaving the body Laguna wiped the sweat from her forehead stepped up the stairs and smiled brightly she said finally finished off the 15th mutated evil person what should we do next Yu looked ahead his voice more serious it seems like new troubles are appearing both stood in front of the large door of the castle Laguna glanced around and remarked the large door of the church is locked where should we find the key or do we have to fight more beasts if this wall is a little lower I could jump over but my limit is only about 3 m high this wall is at least 8 m High y w smiled thinking this reminds you of something the system allows the use of special props in construction learning but certain requirements must be met can the demon use it ye woo wondered according to what the system conveyed most props can be used as long as they fit the current world settings after a while of consideration yiu spoke up if we can't jump over then we can fly over saying that a pair of demon wings appeared on Yu's back look Luna was a maze so cool I want a pair like that too Yu took Laguna's hand preparing to fly up not in a hurry you will definitely have them in the future while flying up yiu thought to himself I feel a bit regretful for having only focused on improving my survival abilities before and forgetting to prepare equipment and supporting props for lagona next time we go out I must enhance him meanwhile red light flashed annihilating many monsters around y Wu glanced around and remarked the smell of blood is too strong it seems like a horrific Massacre occurred here Laguna covered his nose muttering it really stinks Yu spoke up someone's coming hurry and hide saying that Yu pulled Laguna behind a large Rock Laguna cried out his voice full of worry hauh in front of them A brown-haired man was tightly bound to a crucifix around him were figures in Black cloaks holding torches the Flames dancing in the darkness the brown-haired man sobbed his voice trembling with pleading please spare me I was just momentarily confused I won't oppose the ritual anymore please spare me one of the cloaked figures coldly shouted shut your mouth Heretics like you have been infected by evil the high priest will use your tainted soul to evolve Laguna lowered his voice whispering to ywo are they evil people mere Mor aren't the monsters outside mutated from them yiu repli quietly you stay hidden here don't move I will go over there to check the situation Lagoona anxiously said be careful I have a feeling this place is eerily cold yiu used his camouflage ability granted by the demon to get closer in his mind he thought indeed this is Sinister but this mission is even more Sinister than they are these people are clearly not good so why rescue them I need to clarify everything first from deep within the castle a voice echoed the abyss of stars heed The Whispers of your own offer unending blood ahead a large Monument emerged at the top of the monument was a depiction of a God holding a three-prong spear in the middle a bald man was tightly bound his gaze empty below the cloaked figures chanted strange incantations in unison y Wu was surprised and thought what on Earth are these evil cultist playing at wait a minute this book is the book of blood but why does it give me the feeling of directly facing the ancient gods there was a book covered in Golden Light and a notification appeared main quest progress plus one current total progress 133% Yi Wu widened his eyes his astonishment growing clearer this book makes me feel an intense unease could it really be just as I suspected the game bot of lagona has finally made its appearance on a tall pedestal a god stood up speaking in a commanding voice devoted followers are you prepared to offer your flesh and blood a bald man bowed and replied yes I am ready our supreme god as long as it can cure the plague for my wife and child I willing to give up everything for you the god nodded slightly and said I have heard your plea your family will have the chance to live now begin the ritual having said that the god raised a three prong scepter toward the sky immediately strange Vines appeared and lunged towards the bald man the bald man screamed uh ah I see it now in front a strange pillar emerged covered with mysterious patterns from it the vines continuously projected forth accompanied by a resonant voice of the shimmering light deep in the sparkling depths I am about to the book was opened on the pages a mark appeared accompanied by a resounding voice C exist with it the bald man cued his hands his body was now just a skeleton the God spoke solemly the Supreme God will remember your selfless offering your flesh and blood will eternally coexist with God the next one a young man with brown hair gagged with a cloth emitted a stuttering sound you ah the god nodded slightly a condemned sinner it seems you have something to say I grant you permission to speak the brown-haired man tears streaming down his cheeks shouted everyone don't trust this F this evil ritual won't save anyone he just wants to exploit our lives and blood to forge the book of blood summing evil to descend upon the world we've all been fooled below the platform the crowd murmured in rebuttal this sinner dares to slander the Archbishop he's gone mad someone like him has no faith at all he isn't worthy to partake in this holy ritual the brown-haired man shouted in Anger you are the real crazies blinded by Superstition if this continues we all die the god coldly replied silence the Supreme God will not hold the utterances of citizens against them even though his faith has been distorted the God still loves every human equally he turned to the crowd now let us pray for this lost goat May the book of blood purify his wandering soul may he ReDiscover his original Faith everyone began to pray a brown-haired person tears streaming down their face spoke up don't why won't you listen to me are you crazy you're all crazy Yu gritting his teeth in Anger thought it's so annoying why does every world have these kinds of Cults but if that's the case then the requirements of this Mission are very strange why do I have to save these cultists could it be that this Mission has been abandoned for so long that ordinary people have fallen into Cults in general this Mission seems a off Laguna was tightly bound and pushed into the crowd shouting loudly let me go you got the wrong person I am a hunter order Branch priest here to save you Yu was surprised thinking to himself what is happening didn't I tell Lun at the HDE well how could he have been captured not only that but he exposed his identity he has completely been deceived by the missions content this is really a bit Troublesome well regardless of what the mission entails I have to rescue lagona first and then figure it out with that thought Yu grip the holy potion tightly in his hand a man in a black cloak kicked lagona and coldly said Archbishop this person was secretly peeking outside before but his strength is very weak he was caught by us in no time please give your instructions another one also kicked Laguna hard laughing mockingly fool the God spoke got it go down Laguna thought to himself that's not right these people are not good people at all they are completely evil cultists the mission content is all wrong I need to think of a way to save myself the deity spoke you say you are sent by the hunter order Branch priest to rescue us is that true Laguna smiled broadly and replied absolutely true you can verify it through the Hunter's badge in my pocket but that is just my facade in fact I have heard that your church always accepts refugees and heals the common people I truly admire that you are indeed a group of evil people with a noble belief unlike the hunter order Branch priest who has now lost their faith so please allow me to join you the deity responded it seems you are also a person of Faith untie him a voice rang out yes Archbishop y wo hiding behind the door thought to himself fortunately this guy is smart enough to notice something is off if he can take the opportunity to gather some intelligence that would be even better Laguna smiled brightly and said Archbishop I still don't quite understand your church could you introduce it a bit what is your relation to the secret blood Yu was taken a back and thought Oh no I told him to gather intelligence but I didn't tell him to ask directly like that the god laughed hardly and spoke the secret blood ha a church that's just a bit larger after all we will soon surpass them as for the small ancient gods they worship compared comped to the Supreme will which is even more ancient and Grand that we venerate they are hardly worth mentioning ye who was surprised quietly thinking what on Earth is the Supreme will but hearing that name could it be related to the material bearing the Supreme aura that the resurrection potion needs if it is indeed related then I could gather important materials to create the resurrection potion in this world Laguna spoke up Supreme will could it be that book The God laughed loudly responded fool the Supreme will is the Transcendent God the blessing that the God grants us when the red light envelops the page ancient characters appear and the underworld is opened then we can welcome our supreme god the god continued that's right I have opened my heart to you now is the time for you to show your sincerity Laguna trembled and said this what should I do didn't you say you would release me the red light exploded a man in a black cloak shouted Archbishop be careful the god calmly replied oh there's still a lost goat no rush wait for this ritual to be completed and it will be your turn to join us haha y wo held several vials of potion in his hand and spoke I'm sorry I have no interest in joining a cult inside Yi Wu quietly calculated if he wanted to save lagona and Retreat safely the chances were indeed scarce if the situation turned unfavorable he might have no choice but to summon a stronger Force to escape however doing so would lead to unpredictable reactions damn it the curse of the ancient gods that mosta mentioned before is indeed something to be worried about the Men in Black cloaks around him reacted with surprise oh my look at that what's happening to him in the distance a god with a perplexed expression spoke up um what is causing you all to panic like this the gods gaze settle on lagona the vines wrapped tightly around him as if wanting to drain all his life force he spoke his face full of astonishment impossible the Supreme will is rejecting his blood this has never happened one of the clo figures whispered what kind of kiddo is this not far away lagona was entangled by The Vines sweat soaking his face fear flashed in his mind these tentacles are disgusting am I about to be drained into a dry corpse no you woo save me a man with a Long White Beard and a crown on his head stood nearby his eyes full of Suspicion he looked at the hand of God an object created based on the incantations from the book of blood craving Flesh and Blood instinctively he murmured seemingly in disbelief this hand only needs to attach to a living being for a few seconds to drain their blood it has absorbed the blood and flesh of hundreds of people but this situation has never occurred what is so special about this kiddo a person dressed in a hooded cloak spoke to the one standing near the hand of God gently wrapping around him as if to affirm his existence someone else immediately questioned could it be that he is the destined one the one chosen by the gods a purple-haired individual irritable raised their hand to refute nonsense clearly his blood has become so tainted that even the Supreme will despises him a sinner like him should be executed immediately the person next to him nodded in agreement right kill him at once we cannot allow him to tarnish the sacred ritual on the other side a hooded figure with a large orange light in his hand shouted foolish are you all planning to kill someone who might be the death stand one perhaps he will lead us to a new life another person with flames blazing in their hands sneered you are all fools How could a person of unknown Origins possibly be the disigned one the long bearded man holding a weapon suddenly shouted silence the altar ceremony is not to disputed matters concerning this person can be discussed later for now subdue the Intruder first a powerful voice echoed obey to DARE disrupt the sacred ritual you deserve to die stand still and obediently accept the suppression we can allow you to die a little more comfortably at this moment y Wu had been standing there for some time y Wu floated into the air and said surrendering is not my style immediately after they shot countless golden beams toward guu but he quickly evaded their power one of them spoke up this guy has devil wings shoot him down for me y Wu anxiously looked around although he had a couple of enhanced attributes when facing the bullets from many level 50 individuals dodging was still exhausting he decided to take the initiative to attack reducing the number of cult followers first before considering anything else yiu dropped countless vials which emitted a blue light as the vials fell one member of the group shouted it's poison hold your breath chaos immediately ensued and countless voices erupted making it impossible to hear clearly one person said this isn't ordinary poison this is a special one then two people in the group Embrace and kiss passionately which was the effect of the kissing Poison another person exclaimed I can't stop one member was spinning around which was the effect of the dancing poison another kept slapping his face to the point of Tears laughing hardly he said I'm such a fool that's the effect of the intelligence reducing poison finally one individual affected by the poison lay motionless on the ground crying destroy it all hurry I'm so tired ye wo Dodge the attacks from the yellow beams while thinking have they separated I was planning to wait for them to regroup to execute a wide area attack but now at least half of them haven't been poisoned this is a bit Troublesome he still held two mysterious looking vials in his hand a loud explosion rang out followed by a loud shout V wo be careful Yi Wu quickly rolled to evade the attack but his shoulder was still injured he muttered Softly ah I used to burn others with the Chen Emperor it was bound to cause trouble sooner or later when going out to play nevertheless y Wu had fully restored his strength reaching 100% he slowly descended and smiled lightly a level 50 attack hitting my level 18 body really does doesn't make much difference if I hadn't taken the enhancement potion beforehand I might have died by now the soldiers of the bearded man charged forward wildly one of them shouted confidently this time there's no way out right no matter how potent your poison is my numbers still have the advantage just submit to death obediently y Wu calmly looked at them his eyes glinting with sharpness ready for a fight to the death Yu looked at the swarm of soldiers rushing towards him frowned in annoyance and said you want to kill me you have to try much harder than that afterward he laughed and charged forward using the power of yellow light to fire at the soldiers Whaler Guillotine level 40 was available for automatic targeting infinite ammunition had been enhanced with fire attribute damage one soldier severely injured covered his face in pain and shouted what what kind of weapon is this another also Gravely wounded cried out in agony I'm burning this must be the weapon of a demon he's a demon Someone Save Me meanwhile a calm voice rang out this weapon while very strange does not deliver lethal attacks quickly defend yourselves do not rush to attack Yu sword into the air thinking to himself level 40 weapons deal limited damage to enemies at level 50 luckily the people here have never seen Firearms before moreover I just used the skill of restoration learn to enhance the turret causing fire attribute damage and creating an unexpected intimidation effect after that yiu flew forward heading towards the position of the old man with the white beard he thought to himself taking advantage of the fact that these people were still in shock he must rescue Laguna first he held a weapon raised it in front and said the Supreme will will measure the soul of a sinner as deeply flawed as you making you the most suitable sacrifice wait for me to deal with this person and you will be next believe that our supreme god is eager to indulge in your flesh and blood you should feel honored Yu wore a smug Smile as he looked ahead he thought it seems the cult loves to use language to taint the will of others but in the art of verbal combat I have never lost of anyone he laughed hardly provoking him is that so your mouth is always full of phrases like Supreme will supreme god but I think people may not necessarily hold you in high regard he shouted angrily shut up you are not allowed to insult the Supreme will nor are you allowed to underestimate the love of the supreme god for me I have sacrificed hundreds of people for him he cannot possibly be unaware of my reverence I am his destined one ye wo pointed at Laguna who is bound and said with a laugh is that so it seems your old love cannot compare to your new love no one sees your Supreme will as anything more than a dog stuck to him so intimate that you cannot bear to let go have you ever experienced such treatment that person is the true destined one y woo with a pale face blood splattered all over continuously screamed nonsense nonsense nonsense that sinner with a mouth full of Filth dares to defame the Supreme will the deep voice of the deity still echoes in my ears then with a bloody face he continued I am the one chosen by the deity he has not abandoned me he laughed wildly blood streaming down I can feel it I can feel it this is the power of the Supreme will How Sweet It Is how powerful it is the Divine is within my body he has not forsaken me as soon as he finished speaking he furiously grabbed his weapon his eyes shining with Madness today I will personally annihilate your filthy soul I Am The Punisher of the wom beity level one Punisher of the wom beity achieving 100% at this moment Laguna frowned worriedly saying V wo run away don't mind me he is too dangerous if you fight him you will lose your life Yu was struggling to fight a giant man with a Long White Beard wearing a crown he was using the power of orange light launching powerful attacks however a blue energy sphere protected yiu from harm this was the power of intermediate energy lv50 with a shield index of 0% a notification appeared the world of the Shadow King only allows the use of constru ruction props below level 55 Yu stood inside the protective Circle smiling as he said got it that's why I planted two layers of energy Shields the goal is to buy time to escape danger for a moment and take medicine after that he quickly used Master Level speed potion increases evasion rate lasts 3 minutes Master Level steel potion enhances defense lasts 3 minutes Master Level synthetic strength potion boost physical attack last 3 minutes once he was ready yiu grew wings and flew up breaking through the protective Circle he muttered angrily damn it this boss although it attacks slowly has an incredibly large attack range even using potions to compensate for attribute distance I still cannot confront it directly the only way left is to use a kite strategy to wear down its Health then countless streams of power stru towards the roots of the white bearded man notifications can continuously popped up HP reduced by Five Points HP reduced by Five Points he smirked disdainfully and said this kind of damage is nothing completely ineffective golden and orange beans continued to shoot towards him and his roots at this moment yiu was hovering in the air laughing loudly I don't expect this Tower Defense to seriously injure you but this is just the main act he frowned caught off guard when Yu sneered continuing Archbishop it's time to wake up and take your medicine immediately after a vial of potion fell from above creating a Mirad of green smoke the smoke Rose accompanied by flickering lightning the white bearded man held his weapon step forward and shouted loudly intermediate energy Shield level 50 0% armor stat y Wu Grim clearly sensing his power had significantly diminished he sighed now I'm down to level one and my energy stat is only at 50% as soon as he finished speaking the white bearded man charged into attack Yu hurriedly dodged but unfortunately he was grazed by a blow he winced in pain and thought to himself such high damage could it be that the poison I used before had no effect the white bearded man laughed revealing his sharp teeth he looked at y woo his voice laced with producation do you have any more strange tools go ahead and use them I will show you what true desparate is the vicarious Punisher of God level 100 possesses formidable Powers with skills like kissing Poison dancing poison mind-breaking toxicity Eternal dreams and bubble Phantom it has been reported that the Immortals have immunity to most control skills and mental toxins so ye woo must be cautious additionally highlevel Holy Light potions can reduce the effectiveness of the Immortals by up to 70% enhancing the chances of dealing with the boss he lifted his weapon high as Yu used his wings to fly away from him he thought damn I underestimated this opponent too much if normal attacks are ineffective I must change my strategy Yu said to Laguna get away from those tentacles I'm afraid I can't hold on much longer lagona was restrained by The Roots grimacing and shuttering as he said I I've used all my strength but the more I struggle the tighter it gets damn it just give me a little more time Yi Wu flew forward with determination thinking then I can only use all the physical damage poisons and see how long I can hold out he held several vials of colorful poison in his hands and sneered don't you want to see my tricks then try my master level Ultra strong poison the old man with the white bird continuously fell victim to the toxic techniques of Y woo the attacks infused with the power of extreme acid corrosive fire and even the extreme cold Came Crashing Down one after another he groaned in pain exclaiming it hurts even if you are not affected by the control status you still have to endure the physical damage of the extreme poison lagoni looked at the roots tightly wrapped around him gritting his teeth as he said you are really despicable Yu poured all his strength into confronting the boss constantly reminding himself I cannot give up so easily he charged forward shouting let me go yiu sat on the old white-bearded man's body causing the man to stammer out a choked word at this moment Yu's strength had dropped to only 32% and 28% however he continued to fight resolutely a level 18 character often mopped as Shameless and useless now took up his weapon and charged forward with new found strength yiwu felt his strength surged to 100% leaping into the air to avoid the shattering rocks flying around in his heart he thought this is too dangerous this kind of blood exchange battle is truly extremely risky even so yiwu knew he still had some health left to hold on while the enemy was not in the same condition as before the old white-bearded man stood up gripping his weapon tightly his strength had now decreased from 100% to 50% that crept up to 75% he looked at y Wu speaking with a tone full of resentment you a tiny being have managed to wound me to this extent I truly have to look at you differently but from here on everything will come to an end he looked at y woo flying by angrily saying this damn fly wants to escape again Laguna was still dazzled ye wo thought now isn't the time to risk my life against the boss I must save lagona from this battle first he threw vials of medicine at lagona the long white bearded man looked at them with an annoyed expression and warned if you dare to stain the hand of God I will not spare you y Wu soared into the air surrounded by a pink circle he was very weak with only 5% of the strength left with 10% LV he still remained at 18 Yu used the intermediate energy Shield power lv50 with a shield value of 0% to recover his strength he thought to himself damn it I didn't expect the attack power of this tentacle to be higher than even the boss I can't get close to lagona this time what should I do he was Furious using the tentacles to entangle his own soldiers then shouted the fly buzzing around not dying I will definitely tear you apart and sacrifice you to our supreme god evil people quickly enter my body so we can Purge this unforgivable sin together one of the soldiers entangled by the tentacle laughed and said a finally I can get closer to the Supreme will right haha a person shouted God please save us another person tears was up and said please I don't want to be eaten an old man held a glowing orange orb in his hand saying Divine Karma Rectify all sins someone asked has the boss entered the second phase already the boss was already strong and now it has become even more terrifying Yu flew to the sky surrounded by sparkling golden rays of light shining down on him he thought with this system can I use a magic Crystal to summon the hearts of the group of bugs a voice announced cannot diha fought to himself then what about summoning the ancient gods this time there was an announcement allowed however summoning the Lorn World here will lead to unpredictable consequences behind yo a blinding ore light erupted he asked unpredictable consequences immediately countless orange beams surged towards Yi Wu but he quickly dodged his power surged to 80% then suddenly dropped to 10% Yu thought to himself damn it with such a dense Fireball I can't heal in time his power surged back to 60% but then dropped to 20% again a voice called out Le woo be careful Yu shouted damn it let me go Laguna just broke free from the tentacle happily saying we did it however his left wing was still not completely free Laguna held the sword and chopped off his left arm blood splattered everywhere gritting his teeth he said just one left arm don't think you can stop me blood flowed down the vibrant red tendrils lagona turned his head his eyes full of determination and said look I finally did it Yu sat inside surrounded by a protective circle of blue light he shouted I told you to break free not to chop off your own hand quickly drink the potion I gave you earlier and run away I'll hold this boss back laguda stood there two streams of orange yellow light appearing in his hands even though his body was very weak with only about 15 to 30% of the strength left he smiled and said to Y wo how could I leave you behind to live alone even in death I want to die with you I'm not afraid of anything yiu laughed lightly scolding what kind of words are you saying who said anything about you dying but if you're not even afraid of death then disregarding all unpredictable consequences ye who declared we will face everything even summoning the ancient gods Lorn at that moment countless tendrils surged forward a powerful light hitting a man with a white beard he was startled his face showing a hint of worry as he said I can't move anymore why is the hand of God attacking its most loyal follower at this moment he was very weak only retaining about 10% a strange current of energy emerged seemingly determining the fate of the person in front he was called the sparkling depths of obsession if I could merge with him I would become the ruler a Shadow King the sound of Screams emanated from thousands of threads of blood creating a terrifying atmosphere he laughed loudly looking at me and said what are you afraid of Unite with me become part of the Supreme will in that viscous Mass a monster kept moaning pathetically he desperately cried out no Supreme will I have given up all other beliefs have dedicated all the desires you wished for why have you abandoned me here despite struggling he could not escape the blood threads pulling him toward the darkness witnessing that horrifying scene Laguna the one who caused all of this nonchalant lick the blood on his hands no no no I am granting you a privilege it is because of your loyalty that I allow your lowly body to become a part of me he scoffed his eyes filled with mockery you have no right to refuse on the opposite side the one turned into a victim was now left with only an arm that had not been consumed he roared madly no this is not the outcome I wanted clearly I am the chosen one everything of mine has been exploited by you I will not accept this his moans gradually grew fainter fainter V disappeared completely the system notification sounded level increased by three completed the mission GC boss earned 1 million experience and 100,000 gold at this moment Laguna had reached level 33 both health and magic power were fully restored Yu stood behind silently pondering I had only heard of the power of the Shadow King before but witnessing it firsthand is truly shocking if so Luna's plan is about to come to fruition the pressure of survival will decrease significantly from now on however it is essential to quickly clarify whether the power of the Shadow has any adverse impact on Lena Laguna turned around and softly said thank you ye woo at that moment his complexion turned pale and his eyes gradually lost Focus his weak voice echoed you are right with this power I will have the ability to protect you and also Christina before he could finish his words Laguna's body went limp lost balance and fell to the ground fortunately Yu caught him just in time looking at his unconscious form Yu wondered has he fainted he quietly observed Laguna it seemed he still had not fully adapted to the conflicting influences of this power Yi Wu whispered you don't need to thank me I'm sorry it was I who led you on to this path with no way out suddenly the sound from the system echoed you have received the master Alchemy skill book this skill allows you to refine Metals freely changing their properties and forms including converting cheap Metals into precious ones like gold after reading the note yiu began to calculate his next steps this ability is the dream of generations of Alchemists however you w understood that in the current ERA gold is no longer as valuable as before instead magic crystals have become a more precious resource nevertheless in the world of Shadow King gold is still a form of currency for exchanging goods you w thought I must seize this opportunity to stop pile gold buy as many necessary items is possible to ensure Laguna has a comfortable life not having to worry about food and clothing at the the very least I can compensate for some of my shortcomings or maybe buy an extravagant Castle While y Wu was still pondering the system's voice rang out again current progress of the main quest 19% y Wu was surprised 19% that fast could it be that I have inadvertently accelerated Laguna's fate if so do I have the chance to change this fate turning a terrible ending into a happy one a spark of initiative flashed you are not of this world suddenly a deep voice emanated from nowhere darkness cessed and a head slowly emerged you carry the scent of the ancient gods and there is a soul connection with lagona from within the Shadows a being forged from cosmic matter appeared streams of mystical power surrounded his body the mysterious figure spoke I know the wonders of the sparkling depths but I cannot know who you are in response to the questioning Yu casually put his hands in his pockets and replied you don't don't need to know who I am in any case I am not your enemy I will help Laguna become the king of this world while also fulfilling your purpose seemingly sensing something special about ywu the mysterious figure smiled and said as long as you gather all the scattered fragments across the world becoming King is as easy as turning over your palm you have this power and I trust it he extended his hand intending to agree but y Wu immediately stepped back and coldly said wait it's not that simple right now I have two questions I want to know he went straight to the point first what is your ultimate goal second what specific harm will you bring to lagona hearing this the mysterious figure casually replied these two questions are very easy to answer without beating around the bush the mysterious figure declared outright first My ultimate goal is Revenge I need to restore all of my strength and devour the 10 ancient gods that the God of destruction has split apart second the consequence of a moral merging with me is bloodthirst that person will have an endless desire for blood especially the blood of strongman moreover the owner of the blood does not necessarily have to be human it could be a monster an elf or even a giant dragon all strongman in this world can be used by me the stronger the blood I absorb the greater my power becomes one day I will surely escape the confinement of the current world he imagined the scene of himself returning to the vast haunting sparkling depths after breaking the seal through the slaughter of sensient beings a feeling of extreme pleasure hearing this ywu silently felt fortunate he thought indeed it is bloodthirst but at least the silver lining in this Misfortune is that this blood does not necessarily have to be human the feeling of guilt in his heart was somewhat alleviated however on the surface Yi Wu still showed interest in the mysterious figure's plan Devour the ancient gods it seems our goals align so do you know where your fragments are scattered around this world the mysterious figure confidently replied of course these fragments are like the organs of my body I can clearly sense their distribution and existence the largest piece recently is in Ling way City Yu urged him Ling way City what are we waiting for let's quickly wake Luna and set off he was surprised by this enthusiasm himself he murmured so efficient with a strowman like you by my side this kid is really lucky then the figure slowly blended into the darkness ye W stood there watching the figure vanish then said to himself no encountering me may be the greatest Misfortune of his life at this moment Laguna gradually recovered and regained Consciousness unaware of the conversation that had just taken place he innocently asked oh why did I fall asleep how long have I been out I hope I didn't delay anything Yu pulled him to his feet and replied it's fine it's good that you are awake we have important matters to attend to Laguna nodded in agreement okay so where are we going next Lon White City Yu repeated Laguna not doubting at all immediately agreed no problem I feel the power within me surging continuously I am in better condition than ever Ling way C which I thought was Out Of Reach before I am now completely conf confident that I can conquer it right let's go yiu nodded then he cast his eyes on the tragic devastated scene around him and wondered how did this Mission end up like this what should I say to the hunters Yu simply replied no need to worry they provided the wrong Mission details so this result is understandable just as both of them were about to set off three strangers wearing hoods appeared the leader shouted stop was this done by you there parents surprised Yi Wu who are you the man removed his hood revealing a fierce face we are members of the hunter order Branch priest headquarters assigned to oversee this Elite Mission and retrieved the book of blood he raised his voice I'll ask again was this done by you suddenly one of the men behind reported senior the book of blood is incorrect ignoring their domineering attitude yiu seemed unfazed and spoke as you can see the situation is like this I don't know anything about the other matters feeling disrespected the lever drew a spell book and ordered did I allow you to leave what have you done with the book of blood if you don't make it clear don't expect to leave here alive today the two henchmen immediately coordinated drawing weapons and aiming them at y Wu and Laguna according to the systems display information the three were respectively Hui at level 102 Ma kilan at level 98 and Ma Yuan at level 96 the screams echoed blending with the slimy sounds creating a horrifying atmosphere don't run come here what are you afraid of let us merge into one become the Flesh and Blood of the Supreme will inside the disgusting slimy layer the monster continued to wail pitifully no Supreme will I have given up all other Fates devoted every desire that you desire why have you abandoned me here despite struggling to hold on he could not resist the force of the blood thread pulling him back witnessing the horrifying scene lagona the one who caused it all calmly licked the blood still clinging to his hand abandoned no I am fulfilling you it is precisely because of your loyalty that I bestow Grace allowing this lowly body to become a part of me Laguna smirked his eyes filled with disdain you have no right to refuse on the opposite side the unfortunate one now had only an arm that had not been consumed he screamed in desperation ation no this is not the outcome I wanted clearly I am the chosen one why is everything that belongs to me being exploited by you people I refuse to accept this the screams gradually faded giving way to strange sounds eventually the space returned to silence the system voice echoed level increased by three GC boss completed received one million experience points and 100,000 gold lagona has now reached level 33 both his vitality and evil magic have been fully restored Yu stood quietly behind thinking do himself before when I only heard about it I didn't feel anything special but now witnessing the power of the Shadow King with my own eyes I am truly shocked it seems that Laguna's ability to hack has come at just the right time with this the pressure of survival in the future will be significantly reduced however I need to quickly clarify whether the power of the Shadow has any adverse effects on Laguna Laguna turned around and said thank you y woo immediately after his face suddenly turned pale and his eyes began to lose focus you are truly talented for advising me to obtain such great power thanks to this I have the ability to protect you as well as Christina before he could finish speaking his body went limp and lost Balance Falling to the ground fortunately ymu timely reached out to catch him he looked at the motionless figure and wondered has he fainted upon closer observation yiu realized that laguma had not fully adapted to the adverse effects from his new power he sofly said you don't need to thank me I'm sorry I have led you down a path with no way out your fate in the future perhaps will not be as you wish at that moment a voice from the system echoed received Master Level Alchemy skill book this skill can refine Metals allowing for the arbitrary transformation of attributes and forms of metals from common metals to Precious Metals including gold Yi Wu finished reading the notes and began calculating the next moves to transmute gold this is something that many Alchemists have dreamed of since ancient times however gold in this era is not as valuable as magic crystal in the world of Shadow King gold is still used as currency for trading Goods therefore y w thought he should seize this opportunity to stock up he decided to use the gold to ensure that Laguna could live without worrying about food clothing at least to compensate for some of his past shortcomings y Wu contemplated how about buying a really beautiful castle as he was thinking the notification sound rang out current main quest progress 19% Yi Wu was surprised only 19% and the forced mission is almost complete it seems I have unintentionally accelerated Laguna's fate he wondered is there any possibility of changing fate turning this bad ending into a happy ending an idea sparked in his mind suddenly a deep voice echoed from the void you are not a person of this world Shadows gathered and the head slowly emerged you carry the scent of the ancient gods and you have a soul link with lagona immediately after a being made of cosmic material appeared surrounding his body mystical streams of power swirled bringing with them an Indescribable pressure the mysterious figure spoke I know the wonders of the Stars but I cannot know who you are in response to the question Yi Wu casually replied while putting his hands in his pockets you don't need to know who I am just know that I am not your enemy I will help Laguna become the king of this world and I can also help you achieve your goals sensing Yu's extraordinary presence the mysterious figure laughed and said as long as you collect all the scattered fragments across the world becoming King is as easy as turning your palm you have this power and I believe that he extended his hand as if to seal the deal with Y Wu so this matter isn't as easy as it seems Yu walked past him slowly and replied wait don't do unnecessary things right now I have two questions I want to know he went straight to the point first what is your ultimate goal second what specific harm will you cause to Laguna hearing that the figure answered comfortably these two questions are very easy to answer without beating around the bush the mysterious figure boldly declared firstly My ultimate goal is Revenge and to restore all my power to engulf the 13 ancient gods that the God of Destruction has scattered secondly the consequence of a human merging with me is bloodthirst which will create an eternal craving for blood especially the blood of the strong he smiled sinisterly the master of the blood does not limit itself to humanity it could be a monster an elf or even a giant dragon all creatures in this world can be used by me the stronger the blood I absorb the greater my power will become one day I will definitely break free from the shackles of this current world he delightedly imagined the scene of himself being free after breaking the seal through slaughtering beings the image of the sparkling depths gradually expanded in his mind making him even more excited hearing that Yu felt fortunate he thought indeed it's bloodthirst but in this Misfortune it's fortunate that this blood does not necessarily have to come from Humanity the feeling of guilt in his heart lightens somewhat however on the outside he still maintained an interested expression towards his plan Devar the ancient gods H ye Wu chuckled lightly it seems our goals coincide so do you know where your fragments are distributed in this world the mysterious figure confidently replied of course these fragments are like the organs of my body I can sense their distribution and existence clearly the largest piece near by is located in Ling way City yiu hastened Ling way City huh then what are we waiting for let's quickly awaken Laguna and get on our way he himself was surprised by Yu's enthusiasm he mumbled is it really that effective with a strong man like you by his side this kid is truly fortunate after saying that his figure vanished into the darkness Yu looked around and seeing no one left muttered to himself if he didn't encounter me it would probably be the greatest Misfortune of his life at this moment Laguna gradually recovered and regained his composure he innocently without paying attention to the previous conversation asked why did I fall asleep how long did I sleep did I delay anything Yi Wu helped Laguna to his feet and replied with a smile it's okay waking up is all that matters there are still many important things waiting for us Laguna responded enthusiastically saying all right where are we going next to Ling way City Yi Wu answered without any doubt Luma immediately agreed no problem I feel like The Power Within Me is Flowing endlessly my physical condition is at its peak previously Ling way city was a place he couldn't reach but now Laguna was completely confident that he could achieve his goal he glanced around at the ruined and desolate scenery around him then wondered how did this Mission end up like this how should I explain this to the hunters ye we simply replied no need to worry if they provided the mission details incorrectly then they should also consider the possibility of this outcome while both were about to set off three hooded strangers suddenly appeared from somewhere the leader spoke up stop this mess was caused by you wasn't it the unexpected appearance startled y woo he asked who are you in response the leader pulled down his hood revealing a fierce face we are members of the headquarters of the hunter order Branch priest assigned to supervise this Elite Mission and retrieve the book of blood I'll ask again did you do this suddenly one of the men behind reported boss the book of blood as wrong ignoring their aggressive demeanor Yi Wu and Laguna remained calm Yi Wu stated as you can see this is the situation I don't know about the other things feeling disrespected the leader suddenly pulled out a Spellbook and shouted loudly stop I haven't permitted you to leave what have you done with the book of blood if you don't explain clearly don't expect to survive here today his two Lackey quickly coordinated aiming their weapons at Yi Wu and lagona according to the system information these three were Hui level 102 malan level 98 and Mal Yuan level 96 Laguna worriedly ran back and explained please wait a moment we just arrived here so we really don't know know the specific details moreover our level is not enough to fight the monsters here we just wanted to try our luck but we didn't expect to be robbed by someone else first the old man in front with red eyes and a dark chest looked at Yu who was trying to explain what had happened he coldly said is that how it is whether to believe it or not is up to me but we will not easily let this matter go y Wu lowered his head quietly replied we have no other way if you don't believe please investigate for yourself suddenly he threw a powerful punch into Yu's stomach causing him to double over in pain do you think I will believe your words he growled yiu had no time to react he can only endure the blow the old man was determined not to leave them an Escape Route clearly not wanting anyone to survive here fortunately lagona standing behind quickly caught y wo preventing him from falling to the ground y woo Laguna worriedly caught called his name and clenched his teeth as he looked at the old man you scoundrel even if you are a member of the hunter order Branch priest daring to lay hands on him I will never forgive you Laguna's left hand started to transform but y Wu quickly grabbed his shirt he said softly calm down with our current strength defeating them would be difficult but if we do that we will no longer have a way back to the hunter order Branch priest at that time how can I protect my faith and the goddess and in my heart Yu stood up reassuring don't worry I don't blame you nor do I intend to take offense here I already have my own calculations in mind even though I pulled you into this difficult situation I still hope to preserve your last bit of stubbornness he continued his gaze Resolute moreover the punch and just threw wasn't light I hope to use this bit of humiliation to let things pass as soon as y Wu finished speaking another person charged at him hitting him hard in the face the man arrogantly said what are you laughing at not going to talk do you think we wouldn't dare we are exactly the ones granted the special privilege to assassinate by the hunter order Branch priest a common person like you has no one to hold accountable ywu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth still able to muster a bit of a smile he said what good is a privilege if you can just do as you please that sounds tempting I'm starting to feel interested in joining your Hunter order Branch PR upon hearing this the group immediately charged in without Mercy one of the men mocked let's see how long you can keep your mouth shut the older man in the group looked at laguma and coldly said if he refuses to speak then you should you are from the hunter order Branch priest and I don't need to remind you of the rules do I if I find out you are hiding something or lying the harshest punishment from the congregation awaits you he raised his transforming hand laughing with a chilling and contemptuous tone haha I never expected that the only Hunter order Branch priest I ever believed in would degenerate into such chaos he bit hard into his hand until blood flowed his eyes filled with determination forget it I will rely on my own methods to rebuild the hunter order Branch priest not just for myself but for this entire world Laguna stood there filled with remorse he thought to himself I'm sorry you woo I know you plac so much hope in the hunter order Branch priest but right now they are not worth your sacrifice for me he splashed blood onto the bodies of the hunter order Branch priests subordinates those guys could only raise their hands in panic to Shield themselves but that did not prevent the consequences what the hell what is this weird stuff sticking to us a tiny creature suddenly appeared from the blood smear on the shoulder of one Hunter they began to spread grotesquely transforming your bodies ah on me why is something disgusting like this growing two members of the congregation were completely controlled by these things their leaders shouted in panic damn it what the hell is happening quickly use the recovery potion to save my life then come to rescue you all Laguna quickly grabbed the man's shoulders from behind he coldly spoke don't rush to leave didn't you want to use severe methods to punish me come here I'm looking forward to it the man felt terrified before Laguna's power he stammered this kid could it be he brought the book of blood without waiting long Luna immediately tightened his grip seized the man's head and bit hard into his neck blood splattered everywhere causing the man to turn pale with fear uh how is this possible at this moment the man could only manage to stutter a few words but still tried to appear tough as he weakly threatened you dare to confront the hunter order Branch PRI you can't escape Yu spoke from behind his tone call me it powerful the ones who should run are you you provoked someone you shouldn't have Laguna let the man down his face was still smeared with blood but a relieved smile appeared on his lips as he looked at Yu he asked are you all right Yu sighed and replied I'm sorry I tried to hold back but I just couldn't at that moment the system announced lagona has leveled up by two levels received 800,000 experience points 880,000 gold coins and a past medal from the hunter order Branch priest headquarters the two looked at each other then said nothing more a battle had just concluded but it seemed the real fight was still ahead Yu stepped closer sighed and said I have been shortsighted I should not place my hopes in the teachings of the hunter order Branch priests they have become corrupt and lost their righteousness laguda nodded in agreement that's right so what you're saying now is not a joke yiu continued his eyes full of determination I will use my own methods to rebuild the hunter order Branch priest even the whole world The Power Within Me is surging and I have complete confidence in that Laguna asked so now we have to continue right you need to constantly strive to strengthen your own power yes Yi Wu nodded letun go to the next station he mentioned the location and the two headed towards Ling way City Ling way City indeed on The Late Night of the following day they arrived at Ling way City while flying Laguna remarked Ling way city is really far away but I have managed to grasp the skill of flying previously it took a lot of time to travel by horse but now it's only one day to get here Yu landed safely looked at Laguna and said the truth is I have involved you in this if I were to fly at full speed alone it would only take me half a day the two Stood Still gazing at the gloomy Fortress before them lagona said seriously I can't sense any signs of life within the city at all perhaps this place has become the domain of immortal monsters should we continue to fly over or take the entrance to the Sewer as planned ye W remarked if the haunting fragments fall into the city there's a high chance they will merge with some kind of evil to absorb blood and maintain life therefore it's better to be cautious so the two decided to go through the sewer suddenly something caught Yu's attention he called Laguna back Laguna do you feel anything unusual the sound of galloping horses echoed a group of people appeared led by cers seran and Miss Christina from the hunter order Branch priest both were surprised to see the scene and Christina immediately spoke up Laguna y woo what are you doing here Yu thought to himself the hunter order Branch priest investigated the situation at the Twilight Abyss though quickly it can't be this must just be a coincidence but if so what can be their purpose for coming here at that moment a notification from the system interrupted his thoughts the progress of the main quest has reached 20% prepare to return upon hearing this yeu cursed in Anger damn it at such a crucial moment the system is messing with me he glanced at Laguna Christina and the surrounding context everything became hazy and full of implication however Yu understood that for now there was still something more important to do Lisa anxiously asked what's wrong Yu who just called Yu gently shook his head replying it's nothing just an old friend suddenly M entered the room his face beaming boss I've contacted the people from the fragmented Dawn the time and place for the deal have been confirmed Lisa was astonished what your efficiency is that high Y Wu remained calm responding to mik thank you this time I've made the decision myself after waiting so long it's finally time for me to take my revenge Yu filled with determination asked may tell me the time and location of the deal I want to personally go check it out M quickly interjected a bit anxious wait senior you can't go alone the terms of this deal require me to be present the fragmented Dawn operates very cautiously if they don't see me they won't show up you w thought for a moment before nodding all right I will cooperate with you but I want to ensure there are no slip-ups Lisa suddenly chimed in I will also go with you too mque frowned immediately objecting no way the situation this time is extremely complicated I can't let you the girl I love take such a risk Lisa coldly replied her gaze full of challenge huh who is your girl stop being so self-absorbed I don't need you to worry about me ye woo heard the two arguing and couldn't help but speak up I also think it would be better if you don't get involved in this matter you don't understand the reason behind it and yet even he is saying such things answer Lisa's questions will you after all this is a feud between me and the Fright Meed Dawn you don't need to be too involved otherwise it could affect your future life moreover you should also go back and take care of your grandmother she just recovered not long ago shouldn't you be with her Lisa was convinced and had to agree you're right I should go back now y woo you must be careful mque was completely astonished by how y wo handled the situation he thought to himself what just a few words and Lisa obediently listens I've talked until I'm blue in the face offering a price several times higher than the market to buy her materials and it couldn't move her with the instincts of a wild beast I must hold on to this man tightly boss my connection with Lisa depends entirely on you now y w commanded let's set off the other person immediately complied at your command when in the system space Yu asked system when is the next Force movement and what is the current status of the Shadow cane account the system immediately replied the next Force movement will be in 10 days currently the shadow cane account has returned to usable status however the system announced due to limitations on the progress of the main mission only 20% of the initial strength can be displayed equivalent to about level 200 in reality at the same time the expenditure has also decreased by 20% in addition the twin witch account has returned to a usable State Yu pondered 20% of the strength equivalent to level 200 also means that the level limit of the Shadow cane and the chaien emperor is 999 y considered level 200 is sufficient to deal with those wild enemies but it is still insufficient to fight against a boss at level 300 when will the system be able to end the forced mission to restore normal status the system said when the progress of the main mission reaches 50% the restriction on Transportation can be lifted allowing the Shadow King account to utilize its full strength furthermore the expenditure will be reduced by 50% regarding this ymu remarked this is surprising news now laguma has gained the Strategic strength of the Shadow K and there are no longer any issues after that simply overwhelming the opponent should speed up the progress of the main mission enough to respond to the next adversary but there is still one unknown factor previously Mr lie called to say that lyuan is about to find Wong Jen this is happening faster than I expected what method has Ling Yuan used to find Wan Jen what relationship is there between her and Wan Jen how powerful is hang Jen but someone called Captain M shouted captain the call startled y wo he turned and asked what is it MDI looked outside his tone serious sorry to disturb your rest we've arrived at the meeting point but I don't see them anywhere Yu calmly replied there's nothing to worry about didn't you usually say if they didn't see you they wouldn't show up let's go get out of the car and wait a subordinate nearby couldn't help but complain w why did the fragmented Dawn choose such a hot area for the transaction action the surface temperature here is almost 65° another person in the group irritably said no one can handle a heat why blame me why haven't they shown up yet suddenly from the distance two figures were gradually approaching one person in the group recognized them and said look are those two people from the fragmented Dawn another person was a bit surprise and spoke up only two people came that's strange an older woman in the group re assured no need to worry if it really comes to a fight just the two of us are enough the girl in question was demon s an officer of the fragmented Dawn and the younger girl was Nana ye who couldn't help but be astonished that girl is Nana why is she here the system reviewed and evaluated although her hairstyle and outfit have completely changed through the scanner her body structure is identical to Nana Yu felt that something was not right but Nana's condition is clearly not stable what exactly has happened the system continued the scan results show that her body has signs of forced alteration her main Consciousness has been suppressed she is now like a puppet being controlled the device controlling her is likely that mask upon hearing this yiwu's anger flared there are actually people who can modify and simultaneously control Nana the opponent must have achieved the level of an advanced engineer from the fragmented Dawn or the infinity whoever whoever it is Must Die M was frightened by Yu's reaction he calmed himself and said captain please stay calm according to the plan it would be better to wait until I gather some intelligence before taking action against her y Wu immediately smiled warmly at the older woman from the fragmented Dawn he said ah so you are the famous Queen s from the fragmented Dawn I have heard of your captivating Beauty like a cherished Treasure of the world meeting you today truly moves me she laughed her expression self-satisfied haha your little mouth is really sweet but unfortunately you do not have the qualifications to become my favorite pet under my whip where is the money he began the negotiation that's really unfortunate but I heard that Queen is here has always acted alone now she's brought along a girl as her assistant could it be related to The Horizon combat team that you ambushed before she scoffed your information travels fast that's right she is the person I chose from The Horizon combat team Queen s explained but she is not an assistant at all she is merely my play thing at that moment ye W bushed charging forward and catching her off guard you Mai couldn't stop the Furious person in time the heavens intended for me to gather some intelligence first Captain Brothers step back a little getting caught up in this fight could cost us our lives a strong Blow from y wo caused demon s of the fragmented Dawn to feel pain he was really angry raising his fist in warning Nana is not anyone's toy she is my family from behind Nana suddenly launched a surprise kick at Yu but it failed as he managed to block it yiu sternly said please be patient for a moment longer Nana a cheerful Lively girl had now become a pawn in the hands of the fragmented Dawn The Emptiness in her eyes made y Wu vow to himself I will help you regain your smile as soon as possible Nana remains silent after the recent kick her eyes sparkled with a fierce red light and she growled in annoyance suddenly she lunged forward with a straight punch aimed at ywu he reacted quickly managing to block the blow while thinking to himself I can't let this drag on I must find a way to resolve this quickly or Nana's body will suffer serious damage she continued to attack relentlessly each punch and kick forcing him to both defend and strategize right now I need to find a way to make her stop before we can talk unexpectedly Nana's eyes flashed emitting rays of light that shot straight toward gu Wu's back he turned around in surprise but instinctively jumped to evade the attack the beams struck the ground creating a chaotic scene nevertheless Nana did not relent she raised both hands channeling all her strength from her Palms more rays of light shot out Yu recognize that the situation couldn't continue any longer he seized his incredible speed dashing in front of her in an instant he touched her forehead with his index finger and exclaimed you fool while charging up for an attack may be powerful the time it takes can leave you easily defeated being restrained by him she gradually lost her Consciousness and fell into his arms seeing her weak figure he showed anger and silently swore just sleep a while whoever dares to harm you I will never let it go Queen s watching this scene from above showed her delight and said your punch just now was too strong I really liked it you have the qualifications to become my pet now but before that suddenly she paused for a moment and commanded you should still play with my toys first however before that as her words ended nna's eyes suddenly lost control emitting a strange light that made her scream in pain a a seeing her like this worry was evident on his face he shouted loudly Nana his body burned with anger unable to hold back he rushed forward with a fist full of Rage his face could not hide the fury as he yelled you want to die his speed was increasing rapidly suddenly he was shocked to see Nana blocking in front of her she smiled triumphantly teasing don't say such harsh words I haven't played enough yet how could I easily die even though he had foreseen the situation he could not control his speed and punched straight towards Nana however it seemed he reacted in time dispersing the force of the attack around she witnessed his actions her eyes briefly showing surprise thinking to herself this guy intentionally used his hand to disperse the power in all directions huh she continued if one of those strikes lands who knows we might both be smashed to bits she suddenly laughed mockingly family ha haha ending her contemplation she scoffed and said no matter how strong you are once There's a constraint it will expose a fatal flaw let it all out my toy tear her family apart with all your might level free ha as soon as she finished speaking she pressed a strange device in her hand instantly power erupted from her body leaving her days and she screamed in pain aha at that moment her health bar was nearly full but her status displayed a strange level three gaining a massive influx of energy she charged straight at him with an incredibly powerful punch to the stomach sending him flying from the impact he grimaced exclaiming so fast upon Landing he checked and found his health bar down to only 60% looking up he saw her diving down from above feeling perplexed not only has her speed spiked dramatically but her strength has also increased significantly that last punch took away 40% of my health moreover both Nana's Rank and state have started to become chaotic what on on Earth has this woman done to her she was still brimming with power as she descended with a punch ready but he easily jumped back dodging what could only be described as a fatal blow he jumped up looked at her punched the ground then with a moment of contemplation said right now I cannot save Nano without causing her harm he stood firm on the ground unharmed with a confident Bright Smile I'm sorry it's all my fault that you have to suffer like this nana I will take you home now she looked at him realizing he had no scratches at all then exclaimed and declared are you slapping yourself here your transformation time has ended your death day has come after saying that she teased a bit commanding now play with him for me it's fine if you play until he dies haha she obeyed the order and rushed up but her State seemed unstable tears streamed down her cheeks she thrust straight through him but strangely he was unharmed he just hubbed her tightly smil smiling gently with deep affection reassuring next will be a bit painful you have to endure it okay Nana suddenly a notification appeared the host has switched to the dark witch account yauna it turned out it was all Just an Illusion she was shocked to find herself Frozen in the distance another person witnessing the whole scene couldn't help but be confused exclaiming what is this is this an illusion or do you actually know magic it turns out that he has activated the dark magic skill and the notification system States frosting skill this skill grants the enemy a frozen State unable to act continuously losing health for 2 minutes he spoke up the more I know the more ways I can make you die tell me how do you want to die upon hearing this she panicked and frantically pressed something in her hand screaming damn it how can this freezing spell stop my control move you damn thing move suddenly an energy source flew in causing her arm to disappear stunned she screamed ah my hand when did three young men terrified hiding in a corner heard her scream and witnessed the entire event they gaped a young man with blonde hair sweating profusely thought to himself this this is the outcome of provoking y wo crushing a member of the fragmented dawn like it's nothing I'm so glad I didn't confront him otherwise I'd definitely be dead with no remains meanwhile she was still struggling holding a siren in her hand she was about to stab it straight into her left chest at the same time with a determined look in her eyes she declared war damn it let's see if I don't use this Beast enhancement potion can we still have some fun it seemed that after stabbing the person she suddenly sprouted wings at this moment she had completed her transformation standing in a majestic pose the level of the super demon s was now LV 145 a number that was exceptionally different compared to his he spoke in a very calm tone declaring now we can match each other in terms of intense play I will not let you down he asked again his expression serious is that right it seems you have used dark magic in a celestial force as if in response Annie's imposing demeanor suddenly faded now all that remained was the image of her struggling under the weight of a gigantic Celestial body she exclaimed with difficulty her voice trembling in astonishment this this magic is her face was drenched in sweat unable to Bear the weight she began to plead her tone desperate wait wait I was wrong the one who altered your family is someone else I can lead you to find him for Revenge please spare my life I will definitely spend the rest of my life serving you comfortably so you can feel a taste like never before I beg you let me go her words suddenly came to a halt unable to withstand the weight she was crushed to death he stood from afar his gaze cold and indifferent as he said in this life my enemies are not few but for women his eyes gleamed with killing intent as he continued are you the second one the ice that enveloped Nana gradually melted away however he was somewhat puzzled as he looked at her because Nana had not yet woken up and was no longer under control what on Earth is happening he held Nana in his arms pressed two fingers against her forehead and added moreover even the abilities of an advanced engineer cannot awaken her his gaze was filled with concern I viz looked at her and explained it is not that the abilities of Structural Engineering are ineffective rather the toxin in this mask is suppressing Nana's body refusing to obey the commands of its Master upon hearing this he immediately removed the mask his expression revealed clear fear as he asked toxin a physical toxin that affects a mechanical body analyze what kind of toxin this is the system promptly obeyed the command scanning and checking data however it is currently impossible to analyze the specific structure of the toxin because important information has been deleted by someone it added it can be confirmed that this is a Master Level controlling toxin effective not only on humans but also on mechanical life forms he contemplated this indeed a Master Level pharmacist possesses the capability to eras crucial information about the drug making it impossible for others to research it counter actively he continued so the only answer right now is likely the deadly poison Society having come up with an answer he quickly raised his hand forward and called out to M mque come and check this poison is it possible to know its specific origin hearing his call the young man quickly approached and replied I'm here Captain he seriously held the m mask in his hand frowning as if recalling someone and then informed this type of poison is something I've never encountered before however I know of a tip created by the leader of the deadly poison Society classified as a legendary Ultra toxic level called avadas he patiently explained further avadas this is an ancient language meaning absolute obedience once you are hit by this poison no matter how strong you are you will obediently behave like a dog letting others control TR you upon hearing this he felt a bit puzzled and asked but does this poison work on machines at the same time he marveled this poison seems more powerful than the one I use to control Spirit beings mque began to frown and continued as for that I'm not sure I am a supplier of medicinal materials for the deadly poison Society so I might understand them better than ordinary people but if we want accurate information we have to personally seat them out as if predicting the actions of his senior the younger one hurriedly stepped forward his face full of worry and called out wait wait a minute senior he didn't care and continued do you want to go find them the young man with orange hair looked a bit worried and exclaimed I know where their base is but do you really want to betray the deadly poison Society they are our biggest Financial backers offending them is no different than cutting off our own business path the bald man beside him both fearful and in agreement added that's right besides we also have to face the Revenge of those lunatics I want to die he listened to the conversation of the two and was at a loss for words turning around he pointed at them fading righteousness and shouted look at the way you two are acting I've been with them for so many years do I still need you to teach me but the times have changed if they dare to offend senior ywu their only ending can be destruction if you trust me then continue to follow me if not get lost I still want to continue to dine and enjoy with senior hearing this the three were frightened and hurriedly responded We Believe of course we believe every Judgment of the senior is incredibly accurate otherwise how could our company have achieved the scale it has today he was quite satisfied with the attitude of the other man and affirmed you made a very good choice rest assured I will definitely not treat you badly in the future I will buy all your medicine in drawings the man heard this smiled brightly and replied thank you Captain the young man behind also chorus thank you Captain Yi wo once the promises had concluded the conversation shifted to the main issue May gased him but Captain why didn't you leave that woman behind who knows you could have gathered more intelligence he upon hearing this rubbed Nana's head and responded she made me think of killing her I couldn't gather anything at that moment but it's fine I have my ways of obtaining information the man listened and admired as expected of the captain I underestimated you at that moment I Vis was focused extracting the fragmented memories left behind by Nana the events of when she was captured and led into D C50 gradually appeared moreover they were shouting loudly hurry up don't dawle the next scene was when they led her across a rough terrain and split up the leading man said I will take these people back to K City the others can deal with them as you see fit Yun Fe glanced at Nana calling his name from behind and tried to calm himself Nana don't worry about us my brother will definitely come to rescue us until then you must take care of yourself the third scene is when she is blinded on the operating table the doctor is holding a siren with a delighted smile continuously praising I never expected to encounter such perfect experimental material it's truly a blessing from the heavens she struggles to shout ha um um the final scene is just before she closes her eyes sh G lying beside her desperately calling Nana wake up quickly absolutely don't sleep don't let him control you she hears that but because she is too tired she can only respond pudgy brother I'm so sleepy after checking the memories yun's face darkened clearly uncomfortable and he angrily shouted I can't kill all these bastards his eyes flashed with killing intent his voice cold assuring I won't be Humane the mque standing beside him began to sweat his eyes trembling hurriedly soothing Captain calm down calm down Resolute in his heart ye W spread his wings hovering in the air commanding nana will be entrusted to me take her back to the C30 concentration area for mola to take care of first after I obtain the antidote I will return he heard this and immediately accepted the order no problem leave it to me you just focus on your revenge with no more burdens he spread his wings and soared straight into the sky he flew really fast carrying with him a heavy sense of nostalgia and contemplation Nana's final memory flooded back a heart-wrenching image that occurred not long ago the fat guy they very likely had also been injected with a similar poison I must hurry at that time in area c-58 where the Relic space lay deep underground the secret base of the fragmented dawn three young men were tied up on the examination table they were all exhausted but only sh G continued to curse what do you want to do to us be smart and let us go if not when Yu arrives he will wipe you out none of you will survive hearing this the scientist grimaced from his headache and said loudly how long are you going to keep cursing that's enough you should stop now he then ordered someone gag him on the status panel appeared information about kisong Yan level 80 senior engineer of the fragmented Dawn he smugly looked at sh G and mocked him saying Your piglike Enthusiasm is admirable why not make you the next test subject haha the Lackey hearing the orders immediately covered the man's mouth sh G felt uncomfortable and could only emit a few muffled sounds suddenly footsteps could be heard from outside as three figures entered one of them asking what's going on the experiment hasn't started yet Mr C was startled and turned to look the newcomers were three high ranking members of the fragmented Dawn lowy LV 120 kuang LV 115 and yo ulv 110 low key looked at Mr C and said senior we've been waiting impatiently surely you understand the consequences if you don't start soon immediately afterward yell you smir casting a glance at sh G and said can you persuade the senior to leave this handsome glasses wearing guy for me I want to play with him Quang responded nonchalant actually it would be more painful for him to be a toy than a test subject Mr X frowned his expression turning dangerous as he replied everything is basically prepared but this type of surgery is the first time I've done it we need to inject monster serum first and then proceed with mechanical modifications a few more tests are required low key losing patience stepped closer to sh G staring intently and said no me for tests just do it straight away these three are merely test materials if it fails we can just throw them away with his mouth covered sh G could only groan in despair seeing this Yao Yu unexpectedly stepped forward pressing a knife against his throat and threatening shut up for a bit she continued the other two still had some attractiveness but that fat pay has no value other than being a test subject the cold woman said from now on there's no need to talk to him anymore cut his vocal cords he felt a little scared upon hearing this only able to remain silent Zen chain responded that's not acceptable even though he's fat and screams a lot he's still useful thanks to his disturbances during your experiments we have been able to buy a lot more time cly Fang unexpectedly asked ha I did expect you to reveal the entire plan you think you don't have much time left and that's why you're confessing to lighten your heart Zen Chen replied holding one to a glimmer of hope maybe that's it we've done everything we can next we can only pray that y w arrives in time hearing this he laughed mockingly you people are thinking tube simplistically haha your senior y wo can't possibly reach here even if he knows what's happening he'll go to k City first to rescue his family you guys are merely pawns that can be sacrificed at any moment suddenly the laboratory shook softly causing everyone to panic someone exclaimed what is that an earthquake yo Yu saw the current situation and felt puzzled asking hemp could it be that the guy y Wu really has arrived lowy had a bad feeling and immediately ordered qu Fang you go up and Scout a bit to see what's going on Kang responded understood before he left he turned back confidently to reassure don't worry even if that y wo really comes I will personally tear him apart suddenly his voice trailed off as something rushed towards him and struck him causing him to cry out in pain him in front of everyone around from the cloud of smoke a figure gradually emerged y Wu walked in nonchalant and asked who just said they wanted to tear me apart the group following y wo cheered joyfully vwoo you finally made it we're saved this time delaying was indeed the right choice Loki's expression was somewhat puzzled he looked at Yu and sneered you were the boss behind the Horizon combat team ywo instead of going to kigo City to look for your family you came here to save these useless trash are you an idiot yiu smirked and replied not so fast everything has its own sequence killing a few of you won't take much time y Wu continued the Infinity of waiting in line to die is what we get y you arrogantly mocked your level is low yet your tone is not small but how did you find our a secret base could it be she suddenly stopped as if realizing something so that's it you are the one who caught the high-priced fish behind mik at that moment Yu's body was surrounded by a powerful energy he coldly replied your intelligence may be a bit slow but it's not absent that SM lady was killed by me now it's your turn Lok Kei did not hesitate and immediately launched the first attack shouting the one who wants to die is you however he was instantly sent flying backward Yi Wu maintained his calm demeanor seemingly unconcerned low key provoked roared Dan it I underestimated you for my next move I will use all my strength he activated Wild Heart creating a dense energy layer around Yu can you withstand my Wild Heart but in an instant that energy layer was shattered Yu provocatively remarked is that all come at me together I'm in a hurry Yao Yu standing behind immediately lunged forward as if to fulfill Yu's wish however he quickly dodged with ease she was astonished what you can keep up with my speed Yu casually asked me immediately after he swung The Sword in his hand slicing towards Yu coldly saying the attack I hate the most is the one that stabs from behind she was in a moment of panic secretly thinking too fast I'm done for I can't Dodge the attack range of his giant sword yo Yu was immediately hurled out crashing hard into the reinforced steel barrier low key standing on the other side was extremely worried murmuring yo you I use the guardian of Steel technique and could only avoid a fatal blow this guy is truly a monster if I have time to worry about others I might as well focus on myself without further Ado Yi Wu immediately swung down towards low Kei the two quickly fell into a life or death struggle from a distance yiu coldly said you guys can take a hit pretty well but the next attack can you withstand it the man outside watched the scene fearfully exclaiming damn it how is this guy so powerful the intelligent said he only had the strength of just over a 100 but this performance is even stronger than a senior couldn't be our intelligence is wrong this situation is not good I need to wait to senior up right away in the meantime the group of SE G was still outside cheering one guy shouted vwu strength has improved a lot in such a short time he is elevated to this level his rate of progress is truly an unsolved mystery of the earth another person chimed in no need to be surprised anymore go for it ye woo killed those clueless fools suddenly an immense beam of light radiated around them ye woo immediately deduced this is are they finally demonized low Kei transformed into the wild desert Beast grinting his teeth as he said D it forced to reveal this form again but with the three of us surrounding and attacking you can you withstand it behind him yoyou also transformed into the poisonous feathered Sky her eyes filled with hatred although becoming a monster will cost me a lot of time to recover my beauty right now I just want to tear you apart K Fang transformed into the Moon that Roar his voice filled with rage making me look foolish embarrassed like this I will shre you and your pet to Pieces an immense source of energy fused together and the three roared in unison die the consequence of angering us is nothing less than shattered bones and torn flesh ye woo despite being considerably affected still stood firm shuffling lightly if you have the strength keep going I can still endure the group was stunned unable to believe it one exclaimed how is this possible our ultimate move only made him lose 30% of his health low Kei silently turned around his voice trembling what else can we do this guy is entirely a Monster Run quickly however just as he was about to step away a chain suddenly pulled tight around his neck low key exclaimed in panic my neck since when the remaining people were not spared either low key shouted save me you bastards this thing can't get free at all the three of them began to Struggle No please I'm not ready to die I I was wrong I shouldn't have said that please spare my life we surrender I can tell you the exact location of your parents I beg you spare me but at that moment Yu had activated a skill burning everything the entire space was engulfed in chaos and fragmentation wow this explosion from yiu is comparable to a small nuclear bomb on this side two people were listening in that's the story another responded senior it seems lokai is about to reach his limit I can only take a risk forcibly inject him with an untested drug I hope he can the explosion expanded rapidly in an instant it spread to this location the encompassing space fragments shattering everywhere this is it senior he's awake it seems the enhancement transformation was successful yay Jon level 170 in Demon Beast enhanced state mechanical enhancement Life Enhancement enhancement level the people below began to shout so terrifying we just parted ways not long ago I feel completely unable to see through him anymore they said is this really the current strength of Yi Wu Yi Wu is so cool the system announced received 15 million experience points 5 million money level 120 magic crystaltimes 50 you who looked at the Desolation at this moment feeling a bit awkward is this all there is it seems that the fragmented dawn has no supplies left or is there a secret treasure guarded by the boss of the system is everyone okay Sao G slammed his fist into the ground and said I'm sorry you wo I'm sorry we let your trust down not only did we fail to protect your family well but we even needed you to personally come and save us it's really embarrassing I have no face to see you again at this moment Yu step forward to comfort him I don't blame you after all I casually use the power of the Gods to lure the people of the infinity into Danger Don't blame yourselves any longer sa G felt relieved and said with a smile woo it turns out you had already inquired about the truth behind it you truly are amazing but in the end this is still due to our strength being too weak otherwise we wouldn't have been captured by the fragmented Dawn gu Wu's gaze was unmistakably filled with killing intent he coldly said let's talk about increasing strength later the important thing now is that those who have harmed my family and my brothers will face my Relentless Pursuit and extermination starting with the name behind me at some point Dragon had appeared and launched an attack Yu look down on him thinking this boss isn't wasting time with words he attacks right after appearing completely going against the norm he responded coldly I don't need to waste my breath on someone about to die y Wu immediately recognized the person in front of him he thought to himself isn't this the senior from the fragmented Dawn a level 170 strength quite terrifying he didn't reveal himself when he ambushed us before Yan ized his weapon transformation skill Yu observed seriously what kind of weapon transformation ability is this I need to be cautious yijan quickly lunged forward starting the battle and his strength could match Yi Wu's however yiu remained calm Whispering Your astonishment is a bit premature this is just the beginning in a short amount of time yeu turned the tables smiling I haven't even used my full power yet YJ couldn't Counterattack and was immediately sent flying he had to use a shield to protect himself but still slid along the ground panting Yan admitted you don't need to show off you are very strong even stronger than me no wonder the infinity is interested in you yay Jon once again charged forward using a phantom doppelganger he roared I'm not completely without a way to defeat you behind him everyone couldn't help but exclaim holy crap this boss looks so bulky yet moves so agilely could it be that he's proficient in all classes don't you all notice the focal point is not here the atmosphere feels a bit off this boss completely gives the impression of trying to outsmart the hunter in front of yiu who is really the boss deer before long Drive-In was quickly taken down yiu remained calm sneering your doppelganger in my eye of positioning is nothing more than completely exposed immediately one of yij Jan's swords was broken he was continuously pressured by Yu's powerful attacks as he fought yiu reminded him you can't defeat me if you obediently provide information regarding the infinity and the antidote to the poison controlling nana I will consider granting you a comfortable death y Jan trembling all over struggled to get back on his feet and replied if you want to obtain information from me then you must be disappointed right after that he covered and coldly said I am merely a tool working for money but I will not lose my ethics and basic professional principles the group behind was astonished oh my God how did this guy suddenly become covered in blood like that it seems he has an extremely strong regeneration ability we must kill him in one blow y Wu on the other hand felt extremely intrigued who are you trying to deceive with such abilities are you really content to be a tool I see your Ambitions must be cons considerable y Jan also did not stop provoking using the Beast frenzy technique with full metal attributes want to know why defeat me first then we can talk Yi Wu quickly used magic to dispose of all the demon beasts he calmly replied no I'm not the least bit interested in your Ambitions however I am indeed a bit curious about this special ability of yours Yan standing next to him looked very displeased but had to admit for a moment there you are stronger than I expected however he suddenly laughed loudly appearing extremely pleased it seems that our battle will last a long time sharing this secret with you is no problem consider it a bit of fun yij un's expression turned cunning the reason I can infinitely regenerate is thanks to ancient nanomechanical cell technology injecting this material into the body will transform flesh and blood into a mechanical life form with infinite recovery capabilities but this does not work for everyone yon laughed maniacally his face filled with Madness I have obtained an immortal body and infinite life even if I can't defeat you now I have time one day I will reach the Pinnacle of power we all need to fight to the death your strength combined with these nonanal cells will make us invaluable by then we will join forces and all of the Infinity the major corporations in the safe zones will be nothing but ashes beneath the feet of the fragmented Dawn suddenly a hand tightened around Yan's throat yiu coldly looked at him so it turns out your power secret is just to see who can live longer than the other y wo laughed a mocking laughter from a certain perspective this ability is indeed quite unmatched if allowed to develop slowly you could indeed transform from a fugitive into a ruler but unfortunately you have poked the wrong person yijan felt his body gradually losing all strength he struggled to say you can't do anything to me the damage rate of Your Flames can't keep up with the recovery rate of my cells ye we changed his tone becoming provocative is that so you remind me of the last time in some dungeon I met a man with bizarre abilities it was because of him that I earned the title the man you should not meet in your life do you know what that means y Jan felt as if his entire body was being constricted unable to move yiu continued his voice cold it means that no matter what bizarre abilities you have meeting me only leads to death yian struggled to scream it's too hot I can't stand it anymore my cell regeneration speed can't keep up what kind of fire is this no way I I will disappear but you will all have to pay the price Yu looked at yay JN his gaze shifting significantly he chuckled softly interesting but I still prefer the way you were at first proud defiant cold and reticent a notification appeared gained 10 million experience points 8 million money level 150 magic crystaltimes 30 the achievement the man you should not meet in your life has been upgraded to two stars Yu frowned murmuring to himself what is this two star achievement just killing two special bosses so if I reach Seven Stars will there be a special reward then he received nan no machine remnants broken Dawn Warehouse Key Ring of luck Pandora's secret y wo exclaimed inwardly oh my God this is the legendary prop specifically made for the Moss account even this time even when facing mechanical enemies I can use the learning combat construction the true technological prowess of the great two is really strong Sao G suddenly shouted you guys look at your hands when did they turn into metal y Wu also noticed this is the system announced War warning in the current environment the nanomechanical cells have gone out of control and the host has been lightly infected with nanomechanical toxins if you stay here too long your body will fall into an irreversible metalization State please leave promptly y Wu immediately commanded hurry and get out of here to the surface everyone began to run chaotically is this the cost that the boss warned about they need to eliminate all the nanomechanical cells underground to prevent them from spreading to the surface everything around began to explode in that case such a powerful organization like the fragmented dong will finally Retreat from the stage of History who told them to provoke ywo dared to confront ywu no one has a good ending Wang Jang is the same the organization the fragmented Dawn as well and perhaps the infinity will not escape this fate could the mutations in our bodies be due to being infected by non mechanical cells and being Metalized Yu finally appear that's right but we are Metalized not because of direct impact but simply due to mild poisoning this state is similar to being petrified although it's not impossible to recover if we can find the antidote we can definitely cure it say sh G breathed the sigh of relief Foo that's good while I enjoy working with Machinery I wouldn't be willing to turn into a machine however that antidote will certainly be difficult to find y Wu immediately threw out a few High magnetic bracelets the these are the high magnetic bracelets I just manufactured wearing them can temporarily attract and fix nanomechanical cells slowing down the diffusion rate throughout the body Zing Chang also became cheerful in such a short time you have an approach you live up to your reputation yiu began putting the bracelets on everyone the duration of these bracelets is limited and I must quickly find the antidote not far from here there is a modified Mountain vehicle I've repaired you all should go to the seat 30 concentration area and wait for news from me with Nana sa G and the others quickly agreed understood are you planning to go to the deadly poison Society I've heard that organization is very mysterious you need to be careful no worries ywu is so cool that he can definitely turn danger into safety let's hurry up and not delay yiu search for the antidote y Wu noticed everyone had left so we called ad viz according to the address of the deadly poison society that made deep provided earlier it will take at least 5 hours to reach there at full speed considering the next battle yiu decided to conserve his strength I Vis immediately responded isn't this simple master the Pandora secret artifact you just obtained is designed to meet your needs saying that a cubic object began to shine AG Vis continued leave it to me master I will create a very cool flight armor for you Pandora Phantom machine Yu praise the appearance is indeed very cool what about its features I VIIs answered right away the maximum speed of the Phantom machine reaches 10 m due to its Compact and refined design it can avoid disturbances from the magnetic field in Wild areas flying for a long distance will not exhaust your stamina but it will consume a large amount of highlevel magic crystals as energy Yi Wu felt more pleased and replied I have plenty of magic crystals just charge ahead he immediately gave the order let's go now Target the deadly poison Society the system announced understood the target coordinates have been entered into the GPS system and the fastest route has been selected for you master estimated time is 1 hour on this side the car was still moving apparently there was no one following fortunately I had left a secret Escape Route to successfully flee otherwise I would have to bury myself along with those guys he was extremely cunning thinking although I had lost a large part of the experimental materials as long as I had this box of nanomechanical cells I was sure I would be able to start over first I have to go deal with the deadly poison society and then suddenly the car seemed to crash into something what is happening in front of them was a group of monsters what luck meat had unexpectedly come to the door he tried to escape shouting no don't eat me this chicken skeleton of mine has no meat at all not even a little bit delicious the Bull's Head is absolutely the old bones smell of old bones crunchy but not worth the teeth suddenly several targeting systems appeared what is this an explosion immediately occurred causing the demon beasts to scream loudly yiu suddenly appeared I didn't expect to let this old man slip away the faithful encounter has come and it cannot be stopped are you also preparing to go to the deadly poison Society he lay on the ground stuttering you you are finally he realized the fact that this guy appeared here indicates that yayon has been defeated even the successful injection of the nanomechanical cells cannot save the situation he continued what kind of monster is this y wo although he has managed to break the siege of the demon Beasts for now falling into his hands may not guarantee a good outcome either if you want to survive there's only one way the man immediately knelt down Panic written all over his face hero I was wrong please spare my life it's all my fault for ating the wicked fragmented Dawn in such foolish Endeavors but they pressured me please believe me and forgive me ye W thought for a moment his Instinct for survival is quite strong I Vis standing beside him reminded even if he is lying as long as you target the container full of nanomechanical cells of his he surely knows something ye immediately changed his attitude he said if you want live then tell the truth what is the origin of the nanomechanical cells if they invade the body how should it be dealt with he began to confess all right all right I will tell you everything I know the technology of nanomechanical cells was born in the early days when the earth Network era began to transform at that time a group of mad scientists researched this method to combat natural disasters and Demon beasts they wanted to transform the human body into a mechanical form thereby achieving eternal life and self-healing abilities like machines he paused for a moment then continued however this research was not yet completed when the demon beasts attacked leading to the death of most of the research team this technology has since been lost he continued only a few years ago a person from the deadly poison Society accidentally discovered an underground laboratory in area c-58 inside he found leftover semi-finished products of nanomechanical cells after that they sold this method to the fragmented Dawn while combining the pharmaceutical knowledge of the deadly poison Society with my research Al Lo is not completely stable yet they ultimately succeeded in researching and developing complete nanomechanical cells he continued nanomechanical cells are a type of biological cell with autonomous instincts If released into the natural environment they will instinctively seek out and attach themselves to living cells engulfing and converting them into mechanical cells if you want to completely eliminate this type of cell the only way is to use a special toxic substance this method utilizes a special toxin with high corrosive acidity to destroy mechanical cells within the body this is also the method that we and the deadly poison Society use to deal with failed transformed mechanical entities however this special toxin is only possessed by the deadly poison Society you listened and immediately smiled very good you explained it in great detail I am very satisfied he nodded inquiring so can I go now Yu cly replied of course he hurriedly hugged his suitcase and ran off not forgetting to express his gratitude thank you thank you for sparing my life but at that moment Yi Wu unexpectedly raised his voice to stop him wait a moment that way is not where you should be going he was confused looking left and right then asked so where should I go y Wu displayed a cunning expression hell with just a snap of his fingers the entire body of the man burst into flames ye W turn to leave murmuring deceiving me he said so what who gave you the courage to harm Nana do you want to live go down to Hell and repent the mech began to speed through the Wilderness ahead is a vast Forest but the trees here seem to be dead divor of any Vitality suddenly a large Tower appeared in front that is the stronghold of the deadly poison Society this Tower exudes a distinctly eerie and dangerous feeling there is no cover around the tower just getting close will instantly alert others clearly yiu needed to prepare for a major battle Yu had the mech stop suddenly a woman stepped out she looked at ywo and spoke are you ywo my name is Donna and I am the overseer here as commanded by the president I have been waiting for you for a long time yiu asked in Surprise what does your president want with me did you all predict that I would come Donna smiled gesturing for him to follow please come inside the tower the details will be explained by the president personally at that moment I Vis reminded Yu what should we do Master this woman is indeed not lying there are no signs of hostility from her ye we thought for a moment if didn't choose to go directly to war then he would just follow along and see what the deadly poison Society was selling plead lead the way Donna walked ahead and guided him inside all right please go this way inside a group of people were very excited to see someone enter look over there it's that man it has been years since I have seen a living man he's really handsome I wonder if he can survive tonight it would be a Pity to die like this cover your eyes I can't see anything thing Yu was a bit surprised looking around before speaking why are there only women here I heard that you are not Disciples of sister THU a mid-level Alchemist Donna immediately explained they are all orphans or slaves that the president has taken in they have grown up here and rarely have the opportunity to go outside so don't find it strange as for the rumors Donna's expression changed immediately and she spoke in a more serious tone that is just fake information that y Del deliberately spread the actual situation is known to very few people these children all have decent talent in alchemy the deadly poison Society provides a place for them to survive and they study hard in return it's a good cycle the two Stood Still For a Moment Yu suddenly spoke up that's right but you all show your true selves without hiding anything for me to see so clearly is there really no problem the gear continues to spin if you know I want to come you should also be clear about the purpose of my visit I know so much are you not afraid that I might take your entire organization of course we dare to let you in so we are not afraid of the possible consequences this is also the Judgment of the president believing that you will soon understand the two of them stepped into the elevator in the past 50 years you are the first man to meet the president with so little information later please maintain the decorum I cannot guarantee the etiquette ye W thought 50 years it seems this President is also so quite old now all intelligence related to the deadly poison Society has been overturned facing an uncertain situation taking one step at a time they stood in front of the door and donam began to introduce I brought you here the president is inside waiting to invite you in yiu responded respectfully thank you the door slowly opened and he remarked this space is too large this ancient bathtub looks a bit ostentatious did I come straight to the the bathroom a woman slowly emerged from the bathtub so you finally made it here Ames her body completely unclosed step forward as a strong man like you I'm sure you have encountered many women by now why are you still surprised when facing a woman's body guo's face immediately darkened he thought to himself I originally thought the president was an elderly person unexpectedly she is so young and beautiful this is quite surprising Ames lift Yu's chin staring intently as if trying to scrutinize something then chuckled softly you have a sweet mouth and you're even more handsome than I imagined if you don't mind let's continue this conversation like this Yu shivered slightly and replied firmly I don't mind I'm just worried someone else might feel uncomfortable and won't be able to get through Ames laughed waved her hand to put on her coat and said all right then I won't make it difficult for you anymore y Wu immediately changed the subject so let's get to the point what is your purpose in bringing me here besides the attitude of the butler dawned just now it seems like you won't know me very well Ames leisurely settled on the sofa her hand gliding lightly across the table her tone nonchalant of course ever since you cured the old lady in area C30 we have been paying attention to you Yu was taken AB what he stepped closer his eyes filled with suspicion I didn't expect that even in the straightforward C30 area there would be people who betray and agree to be your eyes and ears Ames raised a glass of red wine took a sip and gently replied betrayal sounds too harsh it's just about making a living in the wilderness what can be more important than survival information is inherently Limited in the wild the more information one holds the easier it is to survive ye who sat on this side deep in thought that's true but if you specifically mention that old woman and also refer to the fact that you all are Master Level pharmacists it seems there is some relationship between you Ames did not hide her feelings calmly replying of course she is my biological sister y was taken aback almost unable to believe it what are you joking that old woman is 108 years old and you look no more than 20 wait a minute Yu continued as if recalling something before Don also said I was the first man she had encountered in 50 years could it be am smiled faintly her gaze filled with mystery that's right I am already 120 years old I viz immediately interjected her expression changing drastically oh my God she's not lying Master but she must have used some means to maintain this I have checked the liquid in her bathing and drinking water is not ordinary fluid Yu's face darkened his voice lowered so you treat me specially only because I saved your sister Ames began to explain 60 years ago she betrayed me from that point on I no longer cared about her life or death the only thing I cared about is Ames was becoming increasingly aloof her illness can no longer be cured she is destined to die even I have no way to change that but you could prolong her life by five more years like a miracle I am very interested in this kind of ability y Wu finally realized indeed she has a scheme so what is your purpose Ames did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point I can help you remove the non bionic from your body as well as provide an antidote for that small bionic her condition immediately left y Wu in shock Ames continued you have to stay here and marry me ywu seemed unable to believe his ears what Mary Ames nodded her gaze serious that's right marriage is also part of my plan she went on to explain relying solely on my strength the progress is still too slow the Betrayal of my sister and the longevity lock always leave me anxious worried that one day I will suddenly leave this world leaving all my efforts in vain Ames moved closer to yiu her eyes Resolute but if you join me everything will be different not only will the efficiency in achieving our goals increase but the process will also be much more interesting so what do you think are you willing Ames was incredibly pleased with her plan as long as you partner with me everything I have will be yours Wealth Beyond measure endless resources as for women I have plenty available I Vis immediately blushed Master she's really not lying the money isn't important but there is a huge stock of rare medicinal resources here there are as many as 3,000 women isn't this the 3,000 concubines isn't this a treatment fit for a kingly level seeing ye W's expression I this hurriedly replied with an embarrassed smile I was just joking just joking ywu turned around his expression serious her conditions are indeed very tempting but I must decline Ames was taken aback and then became angry why this is the only time in my life that I offer conditions to a man and these conditions are something no one can refuse yiu maintained his calm demeanor her conditions May entice most men but unfortunately I belong to the minority that still can refuse not to mention that your intention of monopolizing is fundamentally a fanatical and extreme mindset I currently have no interest in Saving or transforming the world when paths don't align they cannot walk together a forced marriage cannot bring happiness you should look for someone else Ames was so Furious that she was trembling the wrinkles on her face became pronounced she shouted you imputed brat do you know the consequences of refusing me don't be angry don't be angry an angry woman will age faster and besides you are already 120 years old be careful not to expose yourself am said before immediately grabbing a vial and taking a sip she quickly reverted to the appearance of the beautiful young woman she once was it seems I still value you although your abilities are limited your intellect pales in comparison to the one I desire however it doesn't matter from my resources I can provide you with some nanobodies I will have time to gradually transform you Ames continued these are failed products from the process of transforming nanomechanical cells at that moment the people in the room began to attack you woo one after another a sneered do you think these things can affect me quickly Reveal Your trump card I am no longer interested in chatting am stood to the side watching the spectacle with a look of delight I never expected you to be so knowledgeable but being too clever can sometimes backfire I don't think these raged egg soldiers can deal with you I have a different purpose together Yi Wu was confused a different purpose everything seemed to be changing your body is beginning to tremble your heart suddenly constricts and your limbs start to feel numb could it be poison Ames was extremely delighted Can You Feel The abnormality in your body yet because from the moment you stepped into this Tower you have been affected by a toxin I concocted this type of poison cannot be detected the training soldiers just now were merely to force you to exert yourself vigorously thus accelerating the activation of the toxin in your body Ames moved closer her gaze full of calculation now you can only obediently listen to me while I arrange everything yiu tried to step back his heart filled with vigilance this kind of strange poison is indeed formidable even I couldn't detect it and the effect is very similar to the poison I once used on Lin Vin my Consciousness remains clear but I have completely lost autonomy over my body I must check the system to see if an antidote can be created IV's voice echoed in Yi Wu's mind the test has been passed based on the materials and existing blueprints an antidote similar to this can be begrudgingly created however the effect will be very slow taking at least 2 hours to completely eliminate the state of poisoning yiu gritted his teeth a flicker of worry in his eyes as he looked at Ames two hours is too long by the time the antidote takes effect I would have already been thoroughly consumed by her the bodies of Ames and ywu were increasingly pressed against each other Ames smiled softly her voice warm yet filled with danger if you lack experience then just leave everything to me very soon I will make you feel ecstasy to the fullest by that time you will willingly stay by my side forever y wo silently cursed in his heart damn it my limbs have lost all sensation even my tongue is about to lose the ability to speak if this continues I will have to suddenly L he realized something wait don't I still have my ultimate move switch to the advanced engineer account in the system then use Pandora's secret immediately Yu's body transformed into a metallic amalgamation Ames was incredibly surprised and asked what do you want to do this Mel yiu did not answer only looked at ANS and coldly said I'm not the kind of man you can play around with look here this is my final tactic to deal with you what do you think how's my my body no chance y Wu used the ability of real Iron Man and she said you she was so angry that she could hardly control herself how can this be you would rather hide in that crumbling coffin than follow me for a woman this is truly a huge humiliation I absolutely want you to pay for it I viz immediately reported master your actions have clearly provoked her y wo awkwardly said yeah although I don't want to hurt a woman's heart but 120 years old this old senior should be a bit magnanimous right a swarm of mechanical puppets appeared again it seems that the same tricks no longer work on Me Ames immediately reminded right now you're under a potent poison and the situation is not like before moreover my puppets are completely different from before go now let them feel your enthusiasm you over here broke out in a cold sweat my limbs are not under control right now how can I operate this Mech I Vis then reminded don't worry this Mech only needs to be controlled by thought I will directly assist you through the control system hearing that you we seem to find a way out there's nothing to hesitate about anymore regardless of whether we can do it or not we must endure for 2 hours until the medicine takes effect completely both sides rushed into battle this time the number of enemies was significantly greater than before youu suspect it is she trying to implement a swarm tactic I Vis immediately warned Master check show that the virus in the Control Card of the mechanical puppets is trying to merg to interfere with the system those puppets are still trying to invade youu calmly reassured no need to panic immediately eliminate the invading mechanical components on the back AZ received an automatic repair notification so that's it this Pandora secret is originally a product that combines nanomechanical cells and Magic it has the ability to shape shift at will automatically repair itself and regenerate truly worthy of being a legendary level equipment so cool Ames seeing this became Furious and shouted you can actually create things like this bring it all to me I don't believe your repair speed can keep up with the large- scale virus Invasion yuu began to adjust his method in his heart he thought these people even if I experiment on them to the point of death will ultimately have to become my tools the toxin used to control Mana should be similar to them no wonder he is a cruel person living for 120 years ye W entered a combat State coldly stating I will set you free Pandora Six Paths of reincarnation at this moment Ames also trembled she muttered indeed I did not misjudge you you are truly a rare man in this world if I cannot have you then no other woman should have you yiu felt uncomfortable and thought to himself heavens this 120-year-old sick person is really unbearable Ames immediately summoned her power shouting loudly trash gather together and become my strength am's body has now completely changed you are mine even if I can't win your heart your body belongs to me I must personally transform you turning you into my exclusive possession I viz warns Master be careful the poison in this siren is much stronger than before absolutely do not let it Pierce you Yu responds understood the continuous attacks feel tense this type of poison can even dissolve steel has this person finally shown their true skills I this size we are in a passive position now Master at this point any attack or defense will also harm ourselves we must give up close combat and switch to fast range attacks aim starts to mock ha this time you've realized the distance between us haven't you but it's okay as long as you will be mediately listen to me I guarantee you won't be harmed when Pandora appears a super alloy war tank am's expression turns sour transformed into a war tank how foolish do you think you can make any impact in this small space but the continuous attacks Force Ames to open his eyes what following the wall and attacking in circles he seems to be continuously assailed still struggling while dying don't you want to become my possession if so she said in the end I have used all my strength I warn you if you continue to be stubborn don't blame me for being merciless falling from over a 100 met even steel would surely shatter bone and flesh ywu still refused to yield immediately waves of explosives were launched if all fears stem from inadequate Firepower then let's use unlimited Firepower to determine Victory or defeat at that moment Ames had also consumed quite a bit of energy y Wu was for it to escape I have poured all my Firepower into making her lose 55% of her health she truly lives up to her reputation as the Master Level pharmacist maximizing the capabilities of the drugs and nanomechanical cells to the fullest but now Ames lay collapsed on the ground this is the end without specialized nanomechanical cells you are no match for me anymore I am not someone who enjoys killing the innocent just hand over the antidote for the nanome mechanization and control of Nana and I will spare your life after all you haven't harmed my family am slowly sat up her voice cold the end it's not over yet she looked at me her gaze sharp I agreed to fight you not to lose but to conquer you myself don't get me wrong I am not the strongest strategist of the deadly poison Society if I cannot defeat you then prepare to see my ultimate Masterpiece my secret weapon another large explosion has been discovered Miss Annie goes to battle grandly yiu began analyzing the situation Annie isn't that the name of En Chang's older sister could it really be the same person using skills to greatly increase the opponent's attack and movement speed each strike dealt additional damage Yu struggled to crawl away to dodge but the opponent's sword was too fast in theory her strength is not far off from an enemy of level 180 however her construction account lacks the ability to fight Beyond her level and her body is extremely toxic making it impossible to transform into the Chen Emperor further complicating the situation what makes it even harder is that she could not use true Vision to confirm if the opponent was indeed an Chang's sister she can only get information from her at that moment Yu was heavily injured from the attacks your secret weapon is truly formidable where did you find someone as powerful as her Ames smiled and replied did you think she had such great strength from the beginning if I hadn't picked her up from the dungeon she would have long been a corpse the truly formidable aspect is merely my ability to enhance her haha y Wu continue to inquire picking from the dungeon what does that mean am sat on the sofa calmly replying you've been beaten to the point where you have no strength to resist yet you still have the Leisure to ask such meaningless questions forget it it doesn't matter if I tell you after all you'll forget everything later on anyway Annie be gentle don't kill him she continued a few years ago while I was picking herbs in the valley I stumbled upon her she was only around level 60 clearly on the brink of death and kept murmuring about her little brother revenge or something I found it quite interesting so I brought her back to the healing Tower and used the latest ancient Nano techniques I had just learned to repair her damaged body as a result when she woke up not only did she not thank me but she immediately left to find her enemies for vengeance the deadly poison Society is not a place you can enter freely she continued later on I made her my main test subject but even I didn't expect that her frail body could endure a type of experiment that would be hard for most to withstand because of this she became the strongest asset of the deadly poison Society at present YW heard this and immediately thought the valley isn't that where en Chang's sister went missing I can't believe she is really en Chang's sister and I met her here where is senior and Chang now looking for the sister he will never be able to find again at that moment a laughter rang out pulling y wo out of his thoughts the life index of the host is checked and is below 10% activating the mech to automatically restore blood volume and the special skill to keep the host alive emergency evasion emergency evasion 100% chance to avoid the next attack Yu breathed the sigh of relief that was dangerous just a moment distraction nearly cost me if she is truly en Chang's sister I can't bring myself to kill her Ames standing beside him observed y Wood's expression finding it increasingly interesting she teas what's wrong your flustered demeanor now is so different from when you fought me even though my secret weapon is powerful you weren't this cowardly could it be you know her Yu knew he couldn't hide it anymore so he admitted that's right she is the sister I mentioned the one my friend has tirelessly searched for over many years to find her my friend even went so far as to make a Packa with a demon beast but in the end the monster turned into a heartbreaking tragedy Ames mocked not only pitiful but also very stupid he wants to rely on the monster for power he could just buy the monster pills produced by the deadly poison Society without needing to make any contracts with those lowly demon beasts is your friend really that foolish but am's expression suddenly turned gloomy however if you follow me I wouldn't mind restoring Consciousness and freedom to Annie letting her return to reunite with her brother y Wu right away ywo continued to curse Ames directly hell who would believe you she's very Wicked if I were that Nave I would have reincarnated hundreds of times by now Ames grew increasingly interested that's indeed the case but now you have no chance to turn the tables either get beaten half to death by Annie or Surrender obediently accept your fate and destiny with me you can avoid the pain of being torn apart make your choice at this moment Yu became cheerful again and said only a child would choose like that I don't want either Ames was once again provoked why are you still so stubborn at this point it seems that unless you suffer some loss you won't come to your senses Annie come here for me suddenly Ames changed her mind and stopped the attack perhaps there was some calculation going on in am's heart you wondered what is going on I clearly wanted to say to hit him hard but why did the words turn into an attack order could it be that I misspoke no it absolutely cannot be even if I misspoke I cannot say anything contrary to my will ye W suddenly realized wait could it be that Ames finally recognized the issue did he play tricks using a virus to control my mind Yu could not deny this correct congratulations you answered correctly she began to slowly exit the mech and continued did you forget that I am also a Master Level pharmacist if you can use poison to control me then I can also retaliate in kind back in the previous Arena I had infused poison into the ammunition it has all been brought into this space however the range was too large causing the effective time to be delayed but now the time has come Ames became increasingly Furious impossible my body has undergone training I am already immune to all poisons in the world he will continue to explain perhaps but coincidentally I have taken out something she smiled and said my heart poison of the GU king is not a product of this world so your immunity does not work against it Ames immediately wanted to rush over her whole body tense no I don't believe it let me show you my antidote how could this happen Yu thought it seems that the king's heart poison and am's body is mixing with the toxins enhancing its potency and making it even harder to cure on the contrary a pure body like LM Vin can break free through blood transfusion Ames grimaced fine even if you successfully control me what do you plan to do next kill me or destroy the deadly poison Society ye Wu smirked regaining the upper hand no need to choose from now on I will take over the deadly poison Society entirely through you it will become mine in a way youve achieved your wish you should be happy Yu glanced at AMS then smirked don't frown and scow like that why get angry pretending come on smile a bit ases Furious flushed red y Wu continued to tease smile and then hand over the two antidotes ames's expression was icy all right I will have Donna bring the antidote over here Donna just walked inside looking like she had been waiting for a long time here is the antidote you need yigu was startled but still thank you however the toxin that controlled the host body has been completely eliminated allowing the body to recover and move freely Yu turned to look at Donna and asked why do I feel you're not surprised at all I've defeated Your Leader already I haven't seen any of you come to the rescue before Donna smiled and replied the leader instructed from the beginning that no matter what happened we must not interfere the leader orders are absolute no one is allowed to disobey upon hearing this ye wo understood so you've obediently followed orders right aren't you afraid I will really deal with your senior Donna remained calm and answered because we have all taken The Obedience drug an order is an order regardless of the outcome yiu turned back to look at Ames she is indeed ruthless she resorts to such measures for her own subordinates Ames remained extremely calm I don't force them they all volunteer ered Yu continued to inquire volunteered huh Donna nodded and added that's right in this apocalypse rights and freedom only belong to the strong she continued weak beings like us who want to live a little longer can only unite into an indestructible hole Don explained further every person here before being accepted by the chief belonged to the lowest tier in the wild food chain they died of hunger died of illness were eaten by demon beasts or were enslaved to death by other humans such dangers happen every day no one knows when it will be their turn therefore everyone accepts the slow acting poison of absolute submission rather than live in fear it is better to let a strong leader take control especially the chief Ames feeling uncomfortable interrupted stop talking you sound as if you are begging for my life I don't need that Donna lowered her head apologizing the subordinate has spoken too much I hope you can forgive me Ames turned back angrily saying youve gotten what you wanted what else do you want my head yeu chuckled looking a bit embarrassed why do you think I'm so cruel I'm not a Demon Lord who kills people you all still have great value to me I won't let you die so easily Ames hesitated reluctantly saying if you say so then I suppose I must obey your command she continued her voice cold but it absolutely does not come from my sincerity understand that for me next erase the control over Annie so that she can regain her Consciousness Donna felt a chill run down her spine and replied yes at that moment Annie slowly awakened murmuring where is this it seems like I just went through a very long dream she dropped the sword in her hand looked at Annie her eyes flashing with astonishment you are I remember you now am sneered her voice filled with disdain ha I didn't expect you could retain some memory from before truly deserving of being my strongest weapon enraged she lunged forward to attack shouting weapon not bad now I remember you conducted inhuman experiments on my body I will kill you am Stood Still not in a hurry to evade calmly saying kill me are you going to do that to the benefactor who gave you life and strength a second time she did not stop her voice full of Rage who is that don't interfere with my business Yu Ste forward blocking her way saying sorry I can't let you casually kill her because she still has value Annie shouted furiously get lost she has turned me into something that is neither human more ghost I cannot forgive her ye W still tried hard you must live because this is related to the life of your brother and Chang am stood behind watching her anxiously what I used to be a weak level 60 girl girl and now I have become this powerful you still want revenge for gratitude Annie immediately stopped her actions and Chang how do you know this name Yu finally felt more at ease and lightly explained an Chang is a senior at my school also my close friend after you were schemed by renon and his accomplices to go missing and Chang in order to find you did not hesitate to compromise with demon beasts since then he has gained monster strength but this caused the a safe Zone to be attacked by demon beasts Annie became increasingly anxious pressing for answers so what is he like now where is he is he in danger Yi Wu tried to reassure her an Chang has found a clue from renot he knows I disappeared in the valley after killing renat he quickly left probably heading into the dungeon to find me and he became emotional so that's how it is Reno was killed by Anjo for me this child even did something foolish like that y w continue to provide more clues the whereabouts of this senior can be found gradually but the key issue is that his monster transformation was carried out using special methods the conventional way is likely insufficient to help him revert back to human form therefore this is the reason why you shouldn't kill Ames she is an expert in the study of monsters once we find Anjo perhaps only she can help him recover Annie also became calmer indeed what you said makes a lot of sense all right for the time being let's spare her life Ames frowned discomforted what does the life and death of your brother have to do with me I only absolutely obey Yu's orders Annie turned to leave speaking to yiu thank you for telling me so much thanks to you I can understand the current situation and what is still lacking now I intend to go find Ango immediately so I must say goodbye you here Yu suddenly stopped her wait a moment searching blindly like this yield no results he continued the time since Angel went missing is quite long if he was in the dungeon and didn't come looking for you there is a high possibility that he has gone elsewhere but where should we search he said the world is so vast people searching for people people also die it's better to stay here and wait for me to finish my job then we can go looking together my way has at least more chances than yours Annie turned around and smiled although I don't understand you you and Angel have a close Bond and you were thinking for me as well thus my intuition makes me believe that I should just follow what you said hearing this Yu also turned to leave he said then there's one last thing you need to do Annie felt uneasy and immediately asked what else do you want to do Yu's gaze suddenly became bright he said quick open the warehouse door let me see what Treasures are inside in a Wilderness Ling Yuan led the Groot forward finally the damn poison on them had been resolved he spoke up and asked what's the situation now one subordinate knelt on the ground reporting according to your instructions Wang Jen's mother is in the foggy land Additionally the village Chief is being controlled the trembling subordinate pleaded please I was forced too I was controlled by y wo another person replied coldly we have investigated clearly this old man has been secretly colluding with Y Wu revealing our movements should we kill him or not Ling Yuan frowned her voice cold don't worry it's not time to kill you yet wait until I find Wong Jen you still have value to lure y waku she took out a blood red stone it's flickering light like blood let's go on the Misty land the day I find Wong Jen will also be the day Yu dies she directed the group behind her the target is right in front of us everyone let's move into the Misty together and find Wong Jen suddenly a few people in the group were confused one person shouted I don't want going the Misty land I'm here make money not to seek death another chimed in that's right the Misty land is a one-way trip I'm not stupid enough to risk my life with you all immediately a sharp sword flashed by the man holding the bloodstained sword coldly swept his gaze whoever dares to disrupt the Army this will be their fate the remaining people turned pale no one dared to speak one person trembled and said yes yes we absolutely won't go against your orders and lingu on hurry we must enter the Misty Land Before Sunset the silver-haired man frowned slightly his voice thoughtful although you say that the Misty land is really very dangerous do you have any way to neutralize those dangers Ling Yuan said I know that the foggy land is truly dangerous not because of the beasts but because of the unknown taboos before setting out I had prepared but each Taboo in the foggy land is different we can only take one step and then figure things out as we go after all we are many people and there are many other groups here to test their strength pausing for a moment Ling yuan's gaze became Resolute no matter what I am absolutely certain I will not turn back until I kill y woo everyone gradually entered within the atmosphere became tense the unknown taboos were truly terrifying as the danger lay precisely in the part that was unknown one person whispered just one word one character even one wrong expression or movement can become a taboo breaking it means immediate death regardless of whether one is of high or low rank Ling Yuan commanded his tone unwavering check immediately the man designated panicked and shouted why is it me oh my God I'm so unlucky I heard that here just making a move can lead to death but disobeying the order also means certain death why is everything a de sends suppressing his fear he stepped out into the forest and shouted if I die I die who's afraid 28 years later I'm still a hero everyone held their breath and watched nothing happened the man wiped his sweat breathing a sigh of relief looks like talking is okay just now I was scared to the point of almost choking he exclaimed I still thought I was about to be reincarnated again on the way apart from not seeing any human figures even the magical beasts did not appear the forest was so vast that there were no sounds of birds or insects it was truly Eerie suddenly tendrils sprouted up entangling the bodies of those below with thorny Vines someone shouted help boss the basic slashes had severed the thorny Vines Ling Yuan immediately ordered everyone do not curse or openly blame this place from now on unless necessary do not speak there is a mountain ahead is that the high peak but the distance is too far I can only hope that before everyone is exhausted we can reach there other magical beasts contined to attack although was anticipated that this path would be very difficult it was unexpected that the army of thousands was now reduced to less than 100 the number of people decreased by more than 90% however in the end we reached our destination Ling Yuan was exhausted his body worn out he murmured this debt must ultimately be paid in blood ye woo looking around she pondered is this really the place we have been searching for all this time why is it a statue where is Guang Jen could it be that so many brothers have sacrificed in vain Ling Yuan immediately used the compass in her hand no I have found him a stream of blood pierced directly into the statue the Stone statue unexpectedly emitted a voice this is Huang Jen who has Disturbed my deep sleep Ling Yuan stepped forward her voice full of respect it is I Guang Jen Guang Jen moved closer tightening his grip around Ling yuan's neck his gaze sharp how do you have my blood where did you get it from the people behind Ling Yuan panicked she immediately ordered do not come over Ling yuan's eyes filled with tears stammering it was my mother who gave it to me she said that with this I could find my biological father Wang xen widened his eyes in surprise in my lifetime I have possessed countless women but only one bore my blood could it be that you are a Ling's child Wang Jen's hand gradually loosened from Ling yuan's neck he stood tall looking at her closely you would she indeed share some resemblance I believe you the boy from behind rushed forward worried l you on are you okay Huang Jin finally softened you have risked your life to plunge into the foggy land to find me surely there is something you wish to ask speak what is your purpose in coming here Ling youan coughed and struggled to speak not long ago the Hang Jen conglomerate you built with your own hands was destroyed by someone else even your two sons have been killed she continued this time I want to ask you to come down from the mountain to revive the Huang Jen group and avenge your son who is also my half brother hu Jen maintained a calm expression revealing no emotions they have already been destroyed he said coldly in any case when I decided to leave I left everything behind in this era the weak have two choices either be protected by a strongman or be killed by a strongman if there's anyone to blame it's only those two useless sons who weren't strong enough to survive he turned his back to the sunlight his gaze distant in this lifetime I only pursued one goal to become stronger therefore I have challenged almost all the dungeons I found in this Wilderness I have killed all the monsters and even the human strawman yet I still feel unsatisfied 10 years ago I entered the land of fog a place known as no one returns in the face of death's proximity day after day I gradually grew bored so I petrified my body to stop time from wearing down my lifespan hoping that one day of strong being here would wait me up looking at the girl he said I didn't expect to be awakened by you out of respect for you as the daughter of a ling I will not kill you Ling youan still tried to hold on if that's the case there's no need for you to accompany me to take revenge in the 10 years You' have been away the safe Zone has changed a lot and there are also very powerful people emerging the one who destroyed the Huang Jen group is one of them although he has just matured he possesses great strength not inferior to yours Guang Jen listened and was very pleased is that true if you say that I'm quite interested so what is that young man's name y wo quite interesting let's go I will deal with Y wo the one whose strength you say is not inferior to mine Yu is finally returned Nana said master I am sorry I couldn't protect my sister father mother I apologize to everyone a gentle voice replied it's okay it's fine this isn't something you can be blamed for it really is good you was finally found his family and friends Sao G and the others became excited one person in the group spoke up this time the poison in both us and Nana has been eliminated we can enter the next combat phase give the order y woo I can't wait to create a commotion in K City hearing that another person laughed are you kidding me except for Yu and sister Annie anyone among you who goes over there will surely lose their lives what commotion in Ko City Y wo suddenly stood up and spoke there's no need to be so pessimistic although everyone's current strength is indeed insufficient as long as we can level up quickly it's all good say G hearing this brightened up and eagerly asked leveling up quickly I remember you mentioned before that level isn't the issue so what exactly is the operation like Yi Wu did not answer immediately but walked over to Nana holding the vile of medicine in his hand he said Nana you should drink this first Nana looked up in Surprise and asked what is this master I feel a very fragrant Aura coming from inside Yi Wu explained this is a nano robot cell that I obtained from that old man however I have improved it based on his research reports to enhance its stability although this is harmful to humans for you a robotic life form it is the best enhancement tool SAA G nodded in agreement upon hearing this that's right that old man injected this into Nana before at that time her explosive power was truly Unforgettable to me Yi Wu smiled reassuring Nana drinking a sip will be a bit uncomfortable but afterward you'll feel its effects Nana did not hesitate took the vial and drank it right away she smiled and said it's fine I absolutely trust my master immediately after Nana's body began to change a surge of powerful energy spread throughout her making her feel as if she had been revived she gently said this feeling is so familiar just like the last time I set foot on the mother Planet it seemed that a source of energy had just flashed by Nana had become stronger more powerful and more confident she felt satisfied graceful and realized this was truly her authentic self everyone around admired and praised her so Lov I want to touch a little Yu suddenly asked mother planet is this a new camouflage setup Nana's expression darkened she nearly blurted out something but managed to stop herself in time both of the men standing beside her appeared to be very pleased they looked at C the girl who had just grown up in the blink of an eye isn't she a robotic life form one person wondered although her level had not increased the aura that the girl exuded was similar to a strongman at level 100 this was exactly the phenomenon of devour Evolution that people have mentioned before in the Legends of the old era before Earth o the Earth had once been invaded by alien robotic life forms although Humanity had defeated them a prominent characteristic of these beings was their ability to devour metal to continuously strengthen themselves if Shel possessed these traits her future was certainly promising Nana thought could it be that the old man meant to have to search for various new planetary systems with with spaceships could I really go back to Earth although Humanity won the battle if I could find the remains of the Vanguard ships it would definitely be a great help in leveling up my abilities however she was unsure how to broach the subject with the master Nana continuously shook her head but in her heart she called him master in fact I don't care about his thoughts I just want to take advantage of him suddenly you would asked what is n doing I this began explaining the spectrum is a bit chaotic with all kinds of colors perhaps due to her growing age the thoughts of a young girl are something even I cannot see through Yu continued don't just focus on watching Nana grow up everyone has a part in this moreover with so many ancient magic crystals besides they are all at the level of 120 oh my that's really extravagant I'd have seen large scenes before but today I have truly never seen anything like this ancient magic crystals of this quantity and level are worth at least hundreds of millions y Woo you're casually bringing them out for everyone to absorb and convert into experience points this is really the kind of wealth that suits y wo it's nothing I still have a whole vein of magic crystals Yu said everyone quickly go absorb the experience value the Father and Son exchanged glances at my age perhaps I should pass on the contrary yosa can give it a try don't hesitate any longer y Wu just got the entire harm of the poison Society if you don't make an effort now there may truly be no more opportunities I understand yosa replied on the side Lisa was also yielding I don't need it either thanks to you if I can live a few more years I would be very satisfied Liz go ahead remember to repay y wo the old woman smiled very kindly at that moment so thank you for not killing my foolish sister although we have long gone our separate ways she is still my sister after all y Wu suddenly asked no need to thank me I have no direct emity with her but if you are sisters why don't you look alike what happened between you two back then she continued it's a long story we will talk about it slowly after all there are more secrets about him than about his own sister everyone continuously leveled up then ywu took out a key after leveling up how could there be no equipment next let's what good things are actually in the warehouse yiu is always the best it feels like the warehouse over the years has been entirely working for you Keo City Underground prison hurry up if you take any longer I'll throw you into the poor area for the cannibals to play with please don't I beg you to spare me the guards continuously tortured a girl it's so annoying be careful you might ruin her face and then we can't sell her if the boss finds out he'll kill you I know I know let's go once we finish this job I'm definitely going to recoup my losses bring back all the money I've lost today the atmosphere was tense the sound of footsteps faded away but the silence lasted only a moment the chaotic sounds continued to Echo throughout the camp are you scared one person whispered this happens every day here no one knows when it will be their turn the girl HED in a dark corner trembling with fear in this place there were only two types of people the useful and the useless the useful ones would be considered slaves and sold off the useless ones would be tortured to death or thrown to an eighth level monster as bait I don't want to the girl shook her head vigorously tears streaming down her cheeks Kai xay gently embraced the small body reassuring her don't be afraid it's okay we will definitely be rescued yanf was still deep in thought he remembered King Yun his older brother who had been taken away earlier I wonder how he is doing now don't worry about me you two must believe in yiu you will definitely come to save everyone lastly I'm sorry I couldn't protect you Yu's parents sat there trying to comfort him with our abilities there's nothing we can do all we can do is pray yiu will definitely come before that we need to keep our spirits up and protect ourselves moreover I have a feeling your brother is on his way to rescue us inside the man looked extremely upset he mumbled what a joke this is K City the headquarters of wuji group who dares to come here to rescue anyone what is wui group anyway even I a businessman from a safe area ended up locked up here just to save a bit on travel costs they only know how to act arrogantly in the remote Dam Area if they have the ability they should come and face off against the elite team from our Eastern region wuji group basically doesn't dare to do that suddenly the door swung open the man panicked don't take me I haven't done anything the guards began hurting everyone outside one shouted get lost we're not looking for you yes yes the man nodded frantically looking like he was about to cry at that moment another guard approached tightly grabbing K's arm and dragging her away the people behind watched in fear Young Fay hurriedly ran after them shouting let her go don't harm the child if anything happens just take us instead the guard turned back his voice menacing step aside having said that he unhesitatingly kicked yanf away yanf fell crying out don't hurt them I will go with you okay the guard looked at yanf with a sneer then said now that's obedient Yun Fay painfully clutched his stomach after the kick just now thinking to himself brother hurry here if not Kai XI will be in danger in the distance about a kilometer from K City a car was speeding towards it mque sat inside the car laughing loudly the big boss is really amazing my old car has been upgraded in a Flash like this we are about to reach K City YW spoke up you're the most familiar here with the deity k please introduce everyone a bit mque nodded and began to explain all right K city is divided into three areas based on color attributes the white zone The Gray Zone and the black zone the white zone this is the public area open to the outside it is the most bustling place with a large number of people passing by in this area there are hotels training centers casinos and even a black market The gry Zone this is the area of illegal activities that the government tacitly accepts here activities such as slave trading hiring assassins and dealing in high-grade drugs not circulating in the market take place this area is managed by the subordinates of the wui group The Black Zone this is the wui group's top secret area with the main entrance guarded by heavy troops inside is a strict defense system it is easy to infiltrate but hard to attack attempting to break in is not a wise choice the best way is to infiltrate gradually and disrupt internally youw not slightly and continue to ask for more details so what do we need to prepare to enter the black Zone hearing this yiu said the intermal layout is completely similar to the safe Zone mque added with another good piece of news the architectural design of K City surely references the layout of the safe Zone but the scale is still not comparable furthermore the prison that holds slaves and criminals in the gray Zone only allows VIP clients to enter but I happen to be a VIP Monopoly so we can enter openly and aboveboard Y W assign the tasks clearly now I will distribute the missions once we enter the city I nana mik will acquire the Divine Spirit to proceed into the gray Zone to find out the location of Yi and the others the remaining members will stay in the white zone simultaneously Gathering intelligence and designing a temporary stronghold for support SE G nodded responding I understand then Yi Wu pulled out a small device the size of a palm and explained this is a high accuracy wide area transmitter that I created it has the capability to communicate over a large range without needing a communication station and is also unaffected by electronic jamming devices now everyone put it on and get ready for combat everyone replied Unison clearly preparing to embark on the mission as soon as they reached the gate a soldier stepped out to guard it inside two others holding guns were looking down and signaling to stop the vehicle the captain ordered show your pass according to the plan that had been laid out mque would be the first to enter he introduced himself it's me mayi seeing a familiar face the soldier greeted him so it's mayi have you struck at Rich again M chatted cheerfully to lower the solders guard thanks to you when I get back I'll treat everyone the drinks the soldier didn't say much and ordered the Groot to proceed inside Yu watched as the group stepped in one by one and he felt a persistent question in his mind he spoke up actually there is one issue that has been on my mind I would like to hear your thoughts on it mque mque replied please go ahead Captain he who continued in the past when I was still in the safe Zone I always thought that the Wilderness was a sparsely populated place difficult to survive in but ever since I entered the Wilderness my thoughts have changed he paused for a moment before continuing even though surviving in this environment is indeed very tough people like you molisa mayor yo and even americ from the poison Club are actually stronger than many major squads in the safe Zone I am very curious if everyone has such strong abilities why don't they move into the safe Zone to live more comfortably mque smiled and replied it's understandable that the captain would think like that mque said in any case the rumors about the Wilderness beyond the safe Zone greatly differ from reality this is precise L why survivors tend to be different those of lower status or those who cannot survive in the wild are eliminated those who can survive and grow to higher levels have undergone life and death challenges therefore they do not care much about the hardships of life when hungry they eat when sleepy they sleep to them freedom is the most important thing it is said that in the early days the battle teams in the safe Zone often recruited people from the Wilderness however those with real strength of look down on the rigid machine likee life in the safe Zone they believed that those living there were no different from cage beasts as a result a situation was formed lower tier individuals cannot enter while higher tier individuals do not want to ye W kned so that's how it is every young citizen in the safe Zone must have a job to create value if not they will be expelled outside whether choosing Freedom or living in comfortable circumstances those are all reasonable choices for each individual mque agreed that's right boss we have arrived at the entrance to the gray Zone I will go negotiate with them mque stepped closer and said boss it's been a long time since we met another person stepped forward a joyful glint in their eyes as they spotted mque isn't this boss M what good Goods have you brought this time of course mque replied then pulled out an invoice this gray area is not only strictly guarded but also shielded from energy moreover antimagic devices are installed everywhere don't worry my Lord their defense system is just at a normal level from what I see we can definitely stor in and defeat them directly you would gently tap mayi on the head as a warning the weak do not triumph over the strong don't underestimate the enemy moreover we haven't obtain the important intelligence so don't act recklessly he silly thought almost couldn't hide The Arrogant appearance of the robot mother Planet I have to restrain myself Nana patted her head and smiled yes yes Nana understands mque reported the great Lord has completed all related procedures just wait a little longer and we can proceed Nana curiously asked great Lord what is this skill Yu looked at his glowing hand unable to hide his surprise all right how come it's like this m a bit worried spoke up to remind them according to the regulations of this gray area using magic is prohibited everywhere is equipped with anti-evil devices if detected it would be quite Troublesome Nana was very calm don't underestimate the master these low-level devices are ineffective against us Yu also understood why M said that your concerns are valid but my skills far exceed these equipment there is no need to worry about being detected initially it was because of the rush and insufficient preparation that I was discovered by toet lock but this time I will crush all my limits suddenly a sound from the system rang out please use true I currently processing the information of the map please wait a moment among the crowd a mysterious figures suddenly appeared looking up at the sky youw seem to notice something the level of this person displayed a question mark he recalled the previous Arrangements Yun Fe and father mother are indeed in the gray prison they are fine good Yi Wu sigh in relief but why has King Yun been taken to another place in the gray area more importantly why is kexi in the black area where the highest level is there must be something wrong moreover the dispersed individuals did not receive timely assistance Yu's face became serious no matter how difficult it is to provide rescue you must definitely save everyone out safely inside a prison at this moment a figure walked over pointed and shouted all three of you stand up for me feel honored because there are distinguished guests who want to spend money to buy you Yan Fe did not believe what she just heard what I definitely won't go with these people who are you even if I die I will not go with you the man immediately shouted if you don't behave do you still want to suffer he dragged Yuni in front of a strange man this man was cloaked in Black making it hard to see his face Yes master but be careful this girl is very Fierce yanf stood in front spreading her arms to protect don't come any closer don't hurt my father and mother in the tense moment Yi Wu unexpectedly smiled and took off the hat from his head seeing that everyone still had their spirits up he felt relieved Yun F's older brother was stunned and just as he spoke he quickly covered his mouth again he really came I knew it no matter what happens he won't abandon everyone but when he realized that y Wu had disguised himself as a slave buyer yanf immediately understood that things were very dangerous she told herself to stay calm suppress her emotions and absolutely not to cause any more trouble for her brother saying that yanf suddenly lunged forward grabbing Yu's clothes what do you nameless people really want to do our lives belong only to ourselves don't even think about manipulating us rather than being sold by you I would rather take my own life ye woo thought it truly lives up to being my sister even in danger she remains calm don't worry everything here is under my control Nana and some others are safe now at that moment yanf burst into tears their parents also came to embrace the two siblings Yi Wu said I'm sorry yanf father mother and everyone have gone through a lot of suffering I assure you this will never happen again yanf choked up but brother there are all those high ranking guards everywhere how can you get in ywu smiled this is simple while everyone was away I've grown much stronger the resonance in my mind has leveled up now I can use language or sound to numb and control the enemy the higher the level of the enemy the longer and more of them I can control as Yu spoke a soldier suddenly shouted loudly get your face down on the ground right now don't just stand there and look he continued to yell are you admiring and envying it too bad you don't have a brother as remarkable as this indeed someone has come to save you is this what it feels like to have family Yun Fay turned to Yu her voice worried brother what should we do next K A and King Yun have been separated and taken away if we leave now and get discovered they will be in even greater danger father continued Yuni is right if this place is under control we can stay a little longer but you must go save kixi and King Yun first yanf replied I've thought about this but I don't want everyone to suffer here any longer you all must leave here with me I have already determined the locations of Lan King Yun and kexa after that I will go rescue them he paused and continued the guard shift change here is every hour perhaps it's been long enough now the others upon hearing this felt moved they they originally thought this girl was just being humorous but now they realized it was the truth someone else spoke up you're quite impressive but I have heard all of your plan if you don't want everything to be exposed take me with you to escape otherwise I will make a big deal out of this and don't expect to get away yanf frowned and coldly replied on the contrary I am very interested to know how big of a deal you intend to make the man was taken AB back and angrily said so you don't want to take me along fine if worst comes to worst we'll all die together someone there's someone who wants to rob the prison I want to report there's someone who wants to rob the prison he shouted loudly but before he could finish someone struck him straight in the chest he spat out blood his eyes went vacant and he collapsed right there the one who attacked said someone there is a traitor colluding with the guards to rob the prison everyone else don't just stand there let stir up a riot together he said this guy clearly has the ability to take all of us away but he only wants to save his own family let's cause a riot don't let them Escape why is it that only their family gets to be saved while we are locked up here it's either waiting to die or becoming slaves a little girl sat curled up in the corner crying into her hands what should we do now yanf asked anxiously just then a small vial was thrown by yiwu containing a type of neurot toxin this toxin could cause temporary amesia for about an hour you all suffer in our place for Freedom that's normal I arase your memories temporarily for Freedom that's also normal don't blame me Yu said coldly after all I'm not a saint serves you right for becoming an enemy of my brother no one will have a good ending however yanf was still worried but brother even if we can escape from this prison we won't be able to stay by your side or it will affect Kay XA and and King Yun don't worry yugu replied I've thought this through originally I planned to finish building the stronghold and then everyone would go there but now the safest place is right here this is the key to the baby Beetle World Yu said that's right I have let baby Beetle prepare to pick everyone up everyone here is the safest on the outside it seems like we are separated but in reality it is not like that at all the door moved and opened I understand what you mean Yu you must save Ki and King Yan let our family truly reunite but you must also pay attention to your safety father mother I understand trust me we will meet again soon next is the scene of Lan King Yun in the gray area although it is unclear what has happened to him I silently thought wait for me I will come immediately on the other side lamb King Yun was being brutally tortured the whips continuously lashed at his body and his blood was now reduced to a small amount you can scream louder if you want because your screams only excite the whips even more but one beating him was Liu one of the eight generals of the wui group Lan King Yun was beaten mercilessly li who mocked him while saying the boss has assigned me the task of interrogating you however I am not interested in old people or children on the contrary a strong and powerful man like you is very interesting Lan King Yun gritted his teeth and endured refusing to let himself collapse under this brutal torture li who said softly don't be afraid to scream don't try to hold it in your pain is my greatest pleasure King Yun thought to himself I knew I would face harsh punishments but I never imagined falling into the hands of Liu the most Twisted person in the wuji group even though I've ended up here I can only blame my bad luck but don't think for a second you'll hear a word from me and you definitely won't get the screams you're hoping for you're quite persistent aren you he sneered I have countless ways to make you talk if it weren't for my Superior wanting to enjoy the show I would have used every method already but if you keep refusing to tell me Yu's whereabouts I'll have no choice but to ask kadu and your mother damn it go after me if you want but leave them out of this he shouted li who responded ah now you're starting to worry he laughed Darkly this is the reaction I wanted to see in fact the more you react like this the more I want to find them you don't have to go through all that trouble didn't I come straight to your door a cold voice interrupted ye woo he gasped in shock why are you here is it really you y woo you saved me the effort by walking right into my trap but you've spoiled my fun to make up for that you'll have to join us and play along you have no right to refuse I have no interest in a man like you so I refuse Yi Wu responded coldly I already said you have no right to refuse the man sneered then swung his whip violently towards Yu however yiu effortlessly caught it with one hand what I do not want to do no one has ever forced me to do yiu said his cold gaze fixated directly on the opponent you are very good I like you the man said his eyes shining with desire compared to L King Yun you excite me much more now the fire of Desire Within me has ignited like never before Yu smiled faintly and replied I don't care whether it's lust or whatever at your level in front of me you're not even qualified keep spouting that trash the angrier you get the more interesting I find it as soon as he finished his sentence Yi Wu delivered a powerful kick sending the Man flying over 10 m blood sprayed from his mouth is that what shocks you it's not easy to encounter an opponent who can wield my fire ye Yu said the man chuckled softly but that smile quickly faded when Yu struck him again crashing hard against the opposite wall blood continued to flow staining the ground the fire of mine he gasped but before he could finish his sentence ye wo slammed him violently against the wall you are indeed strong but you're just a foolish person with a bit of strength ye wo concluded his eyes filled with contempt he tried to calm down regaining some strength and said this is the territory of wuji group The Noise just now has attracted attention the guards are on their way here even if you grew Wings it would be hard to escape y Wu scoffed replying do you think I don't know that fortunately I found a treasure in the warehouse this space has been isolated by me no one outside knows anything he was astonished yelling what are you saying space killing array how you have that I don't believe this can trap me he slammed hard against theall all but y Wu remained calm and said it's useless even if you turn this space to ashes the people outside would notice he angrily roared you bastard I will go all out against you yiu shrugged coldly replying I'm not interested in you you should just take your leave he shouted if you kill me that will also be a dead end no matter how powerful you are you can't take on the whole wui group we still have many unbeatable secret weapons once we unleash their full power the entire world will be in our hands yiu interrupted you don't need to say anymore saying that Yu decisively ended his life is this world truly that of wui group Yu wondered but he knew one thing for sure that person would never have the chance to see notification system experience gained 500,000 reward 1 million The Killing intent radiating from ywu had severely harmed the man in front of him the items obtained include a sexy leather whip a sexy leather case a sexy outfit only to be worn by the right person as for the sexy mask these are all props that have fallen how bizarre throw it away it's really unfortunate that it fell into the hands of this pervert thankfully you arrived in time otherwise who knows what would have happened Hing Yun breathed the sigh of relief well let's not talk about this for now since you took the initiative to strike it means you know the cause and effect clearly right hin Yun nodded his expression serious that's right everything is related to the secret weapon the wuji group that li who just mentioned that weapon is an ancient one that the wuji group possesses y Wu asked surprised correct King Yun replied firmly what the wui group also has an ancient are you sure can the wui group be trusted where did you hear this from y woo question his voice betraying his confus confusion King Yun lowered his voice his gaze probing I overheard a conversation between Liu and others they spoke of a secret weapon some kind of experiment however I do not have clear information about the ancient because I have very little int tell but one thing is certain only the wui group knows the true appearance of the ancient even the eight great generals only know of its existence the wui group has been in secluded cultivation for more than 10 years only issuing orders through communication to tools to direct the eight great generals King Yun continued if they really have an ancient based on the power of the gods they could easily dominate The Wild regions and the entire Southwestern area but up till now they have never taken action King Yun said perhaps there is some condition binding them but that is not important what matters is the reason they captured kxa it's possible that kayak is related to the wuji group's secluded cultivation and ancient matters I need to go to the Zone to rescue key XA you should set up a temporary point in the white zone and gather with your teammates first this is new equipment I've prepared for you and a magic Crystal used for leveling up take the opportunity to absorb it to increase your strength when the time comes I will send a signal to act understood you are still as thoughtful as ever the other person replied if the reason is due to the wui groups secluded cultivation the black Zone must surely be in a lockdown state it will be extremely difficult to get in even if it's difficult I must go KU XI is waiting for me y we said with a determined gaze in Kao City in the black Zone inside a secret laboratory in a tall tower synchronization rate 80% synchronization successful Fusion progress has reached 30% energy conversion is stable gradually increased transmission power to the Limit he truly could not imagine previously the highest synchronization rate was only about 50% but after adding this girl the rate increased to 80% this is completely inconsistent with science but it has indeed happened this is tan K one of the eight generals of the wuji group he said anyway in the era of the earth o era there are many things that are unscientific there's no need to clarify further continue to stabilize the fusion rate until it reaches 100% the wui group's intention is to directly seize the body of the ancient T can said at that time there will be no one in this world who could stop us the wui group will stand at the peak of the world a warning could someone have infiltrated is Liu already dead what is happening could it be that yuu has entered K City and dealt with Liu already for a man with ancient Powers This Is Not Unusual at all but just at that moment the final M dish should be served at the dining table the person I have set my sights on will not Escape my magic immediately mobilize all the cameras in the black Zone understood continuous alerts appeared what is going on tens of thousands of cameras in the black zone are all malfunctioning what about the communication system with the outside is there any report about the Intruder boss it's not just the cameras even the communication system with the outside has gone down we have been completely isolated I never expected that my proud defense system would be paralyzed this quickly y Wu truly has skills I underestimated him no matter how strong you are you cannot break through the main gate of the tower because it requires the marks of the eight great generals to enter chin K said as long as I withdraw into the tower and wait for the wui group to complete the fusion it will be fine but to take precautions I must say that we cannot connect try again even the private communication signals have been hacked Tian Kon was surprised can you really Reach This level I absolutely will not allow anyone to surpass me in the art of survival I will not spare you mque said no wonder you are a master of manipulation you easily control so many guards like this for the master this is a piece of cake these two soldiers are completely under his Poison's influence this door is indeed very solid perhaps only with the full Firepower of the flame Emperor could we barely break through but in a situation where we are unsure of what lies inside it's better not to act recklessly Master do you see that this place seems to be for inserting something indeed it looks like a classic mechanism with eight slots could it be related to the eight generals of the wui group definitely what do you know about these eight generals youve asked of course in kosi no one is unaware of them each person has their own force and specialized field li who whom you just defeated is in charge of the gray area although they operate as a whole their boundaries of Power are clearly defined no one easily crosses those lines additionally their naming and division are said to be based on an ancient mystical Theory but the specifics are unclear ye thought it seems we have to face each one of them in turn this significantly delays my rescue plan I wonder how the situation with kakai inside is but right now there's no other way Nana said Master we can split into two directions that way our efficiency will be higher she continued Master we can split into two action directions like this to increase efficiency if I unleash my full power I can surpass level 20 in combat Nana do you want to act alone those damn bastards I must avenge sister Yan FEI and father mother don't talk as if they encountered something major it took great difficulty to have such a strong body of course I must seize the opportunity to become stronger even faster to to grow to a level where even you cannot catch up with me master that's not my intention Master if you are so determined I will UST this to you but you must pay attention to your safety if something goes wrong absolutely do not prolong the battle do you understand Master rest assured Nan understands My Level has increased quite a bit however there are too many people in this city who know you if you are exposed it will be inconvenient for future operations and support there will be many things I will lead your help with in the future I understand then I will stay here to wish you both Victory go in Just 2 hours Nana had completed the battle outside the upscale bar in the gray District mirrored Moon two security guards wearing black glasses were checking the customers wanting to enter the bar this place serves independent Travelers only VIP customers are allowed inside the diening sound echoed the excited screams the upbeat music and the girls dancing on poles endlessly their bodies swaying to the Rhythm you dance beautifully look over here give me a kiss let's have another drink ha if you insist Madame Ki level 125 with her sultry figure waved a fan smiling as she asked is everyone having fun tonight oh it's you miss KY the owner is here too we're having a great time yes as long as everyone is happy I welcome you all to come on often I will gladly provide the best service while attending the guests a red-haired girl rushed over her face filled with worry Mom it's not good KY frowned what's so alarming in front of the guests and you're acting like this the girl bowed her head in apology I'm sorry but the VIP guests in room 3001 have had too much to drink they won't listen to advice and they're bullying the girls Ki nodded all right Lead Me there as she entered the room Ki saw a group of Ruffians their hair slick back and standing on end wearing armor teasing the young girls stop resisting just obediently do as you're told one man said I'm paying so much money and I can't have any fun do you believe I'll smash this joint of yours please don't a girl softly pleaded Ki stepped forward smiling politely dear guest I hope you can stay calm today is the day you just became a VIP member right the gangster asked so what who are you Ki calmly replied I am the owner here let me introduce you to the rules of my place we only serve drinks we do not sell our bodies if you want more services you'll have to see if you have the charm to win over our girls using money or Force to coorse is strictly prohibited the gangster smirked sneering sharp tone women like you pretending to be pure isn't it all about the money when you go out to work I'm big now money is no issue as he spoke he pulled out a stack of cash waving it in front of Ki is this enough seeing the insulting action ky's face darkened she replied rules are rules if you truly have needs in that aspect I can arrange for you to go to a place in the red light district the gangster suddenly became more aggressive I don't want that I'm tired of the red light district today I want to try the taste of girls in the gray area he stepped closer stroking KY chin his voice gleeful looking closely your beauty isn't bad an aging Beauty still has her Allure how about Ki coldly said please respect yourself having said that she twisted his hand that had just touched her his scream of pain echoed my hand is broken let me go seeing their boss being hurt the gang members rushed in one shouted loudly youve got guts daring to hurt my boss kill her suddenly a red liquid appeared on their for fore heads everyone don't move the liquid on our forehead is red wine in my establishment no one can force my people to do anything against their will now I give you two options one sit down and slowly enjoy the wine I'm offering two continue causing trouble and then enjoy the full body disposal service at that point your bodies will be picked up by someone else taken for cremation and stuffed into jars one Thug turned pale his voice trembling the ability to control liquid here could it be I remember now you were one of the eight generals of the wuji group with the ability to control liquid Ki but it didn't expect you to be the owner of a nightclub another one panicked boss we messed with the wrong person he immediately turned to KI flattering we will drink drink right away we apologize for not understanding the rules and offending you please spare Our Lives each of us will immediately make a lifetime VIP card to make amends for our mistake Ki smiled brightly well then that sailed I wish everyone a wonderful evening wonderful extremely wonderful the owner can take her time even though Ki could easily kill them all she chose not to she truly was someone who could see the bigger picture in Yu's hand was a half finished glass of milk she said hand over your mark I can choose not to make things difficult for you that would be good for everyone Ki said you are Yu this isn't really a place for chatting Yu replied I understand she leaned back on the sofa her gaze scrutinizing it seems you are indeed the legendary Yu I didn't expect you to be so young and handsome if you've managed to find your way here I assume you've dealt with the fire already you're preparing to head to the black Zone to rescue people right y Wu answered since you already know what's going on I won't beat around the bush to benefit yourself the most I'm sure you know what to do kangi laughed haha of course a person like you who can easily take down Lio I'm not foolish enough to confront you directly all right I can hand over the mark to you but before that since it's rare for you to visit me wouldn't you like to try our Exquisite wine it's a service that one has to pay a hefty sum to enjoy come on in at ky's command two beautiful women brought over the wine they approached G woo one of them cing hansome let me drink with you or we can do something even more interesting yiu frowned looking confused hey isn't this place supposed to be one where that kind of business doesn't happen why is it like this Ki Shrugged smiling I never said it was forbidden it's just that violence and money can't be used to coerce anyone she said my children willingly do this for you so isn't that a good thing she waved her hand to Signal now there are important matters to attend to you girls can step back for a moment the two girls sigh in confusion he mom really is Ki poured wine lifted her glass and her cheeks were starting to flush take the seals actually I don't care about fighting with you men I just want to protect my little corner of the world so that the children under my care can live a short peaceful life in this apocalypse this is indeed the right choice she paused for a moment her gaze contemplative after I deal with wui group I can fulfill your wish you really are bold to dare to do this upon our first meeting however I have two sincere pieces of advice first Gathering all eight seals to enter the dark area is already impossible one of the eight generals tan K has long been in the tower of the dark area you won't be able to meet him second while we are talking here the other one of the eight generals has arrived you should prepare yourself mentally Yu's face became serious his sharp gaze shot at her did you notify them KY replied that's right if you can't defeat them then don't talk about defeating the wui group if you want me to bet on you at least you have to show a little real strength if you can truly defeat them I will tell you only I know the secret method to enter the central tower in the black Zone he sneered haha I can't deny it you are indeed a formidable woman want to test my strength no problem just when I was troubled about having to search for them one by one wasting time let's go together the crowd buzzed hey everyone look over there oh my God is it real or fake this is the first time I've seen five Gods appear at the same time the generals are all stepping forward the first person was Jen Le the man riding the lion was Jen sha the tallest one was dun the only girl in the root was zidi and finally there was sunfang one voice spoke up dripping with sarc ASM if it weren't for the Urgent situation who'd want to work with that gay guy another snapb don't let me in with that li who if you do I'll really kill you the first one chuckled derisively a transgender and a furry lover I see the two of you really are quite similar the blue-haired girl interjected with disdain in her eyes you're not much better you filthy men always immature and pointless like this he turned to smirk coldly don't provoke me zedu or the consequences won't be pleasant he said now is not the time for internal strife among ourselves if you want to make some moves while master wuji group is in secluded cultivation you'll have to wait until after we kill y woo but if the wuji group investigates you must bear the consequences yourself spare me the wrath of Master wui group is more terrifying than hell especially since before going into secluded cultivation he instructed us on many matters and requested that we were together to deal with this do you think this is just making a big deal out of nothing because of a kid coming from the safe Zone if you truly think so then you will definitely be the second to die because Ki said li who had already been taken care of by that guy of course li who was the weakest Among Us so it's not surprising he was taken down first but that proves we cannot underestimate that kid he not only handled broken down but also infiltrated our headquarters without anyone knowing such strength cannot be taken lightly not to mention that he holds the ancient in his hands if we are careless we could all die at his hands zenui said that's why Ki asked us to take action together to ensure that kid has no chance to use the ancient she truly deserves her reputation as the best strategist Among Us her intellect far surpasses that of you filthy men Nana said stop you guys are the five generals under wui group right don't even think about taking another step Nana coldly stated for my master I will make sure you disappear here one of them laughed loudly where did this kid come from it's hilarious Nana said wife are you too laughing at I'll kill you all first Nana frowned her expression tense although she spoke ruthlessly she knew very well that the level of these individuals was not low if it really comes to a confrontation I definitely won't be able to defeat them the only way left is to draw the hatred towards my master she thought one of the generals looked at Nana carefully and then burst out laughing aren't you the mechanical one that broken Dawn captured before you've changed so much I almost didn't recognize you Nana conly replied that's right but now I am the upgraded version today I came to seek revenge because you captured sister Yun FEI and my parents prepared to die Nana recalled her master's teachings when surrounded you must focus on one person she fixed her Gaze on the Beast Rider and shouted all right let me play with you the guy smirked you guys go ahead I'll deal with her first then chase after you but remember don't fail miserably at that moment another person named Annie flew down from above stop he looked at Nana then turned to the others who is this how can the defense of K City be this week Nana maintained her icy glare the others can go but you cannot I I have questions for you the red-haired girl have her sword resting against Zid we's throat looking for me do I know you she asked with a contemptuous tone are you making a fool of yourself in the wild I've never heard of a strong man with your identification number this rank of yours is most likely due to some special equipment you use isn't it zedu tried to stay calm but couldn't afford to underestimate the girl's confident attitude although she had only come to find him it was clear that she possessed strength those around her looked at her with wary eyes if you've dared to confront us you must have some skill one of the group whispered to his teammates we don't need to compare ourselves with her let her deal with Zid do it herself another person remarked with a smirk very good we can avoid sharing the credit for once the sword remained pressed against zidu neck as the red-haired girl coldly stated no matter what you ask as long as you're the one pointing a sword at me no one can walk away alive have you realized that the pressure mounted and zedu tried to think of a way to cope since you brought five people here you must have found an arena to fight in zenu asked trying to buy some time if not fighting here will ruin this place the red-haired girl nodded and pointed into the distance of course there's a fighting arena not far from here it's very spacious called the combat stage perfect for a battle good I'll head there first you can come after zenui stepped out the door his mind racing what could she be plotting although I could use poison control to force her to reveal have enter the hidden area it might be more efficient to settle everything in one go this fight whether I want it or not will eventually happen Yu stepped into the arena where everything stood out prominently the audience was dense and the Lively atmosphere made him smile involuntarily this place really knows how to stir excitement y Wu thought to himself while he was observing sulet unexpectedly blocked his way this isn't a place for a kiddo like you get out of here the large man in front of him shouted loudly yeu just smirked slipped past without saying a word on the stage two competitors were fiercely confronting each other Pascal nicknamed Thunder Emperor and Kango known as Overlord were continuously delivering powerful punches is that all you've got are you already out of breath Kango mocked dodging a punch and counterattacking Pascal refused to back down his punch sounded like roaring Thunder but Kango only scoffed your punch is just a tickle for me the audience was cheering wildly each Roar shaking the arena suddenly from the main entrance a colossal Force surged in two guards were sent flying like ragd dolls crashing hard onto the ground the crowd Buzz what's happening something suddenly went down a commentator yelled amidst the SW squiring dust a figure emerged it was a teenager with a cold gaze and an imposing Aura he slowly walked into the arena capturing everyone's attention who is that teenager what does he want y wo confidently walked in looked around and said this place is not bad quite spacious and there are many Spectators the competition later is sure to be very interesting the two others saw this and approached their expressions full of hostility one of them spoke up this dares to disturb our match is he tired of living it seems that the matter of determining the winner between us will have to be put on hold we need to deal with this disrespectful brat first both pointed at Yu their eyes filled with disdain facing that overwhelming Aura Yi Wu unexpectedly pointed at the announcer and said hey you why are you just standing there hurry up and announce the betting oh by the way I bet 5,000 that I will win the announcer was confused but still still spoke into the microphone what is this an unprecedented situation this young man not only dares to challenge two Champion contenders at once but also bets on himself is he just a rich kid who likes to waste money or is he truly a mysterious expert below the crowd buzzed with discussion is this a joke who would bet on that Kido this is interesting but I bet one you on that he wins let's see another person laughed loudly this is really funny this must be a setup by the organizers but it cannot be denied the entertainment level has suddenly increased they discuss kid you don't know the heights of heaven or the depths of the earth it seems we have to let you taste a bit of suffering to understand reality don't worry we'll act quickly and we won't let you suffer for long the teenager smirked faintly got it got it but you guys should take some stamina recovery potions first to avoid being accused of me bullying you then let's all attack it once consider it a warm-up before the main event one of them shouted want to die fine I'll oblige immediately two of them teamed up to use the skill's dominating power and Thunder God strike charging towards the teenager the final battle had begun these two were originally competing for the championship yet they unexpectedly joined forces to attack the newly appeared teenager however the attack was quickly neutralized by y Wu with ease one person in the crowd exclaimed in astonishment what he easily blocked the attacks from both of them unbelievable Yu coldly steep forward grabbed the heads of the two and slammed them together the sound of their whales echoed they were completely overwhelmed like toys in the hands of the teenager the crowd began to buzz who on Earth is this teenager oh my am I seeing things is this real there's someone this powerful in K City fortunately I just placed all my bets on him someone daring enough to step into the arena like this must be extraordinary it's a Pity I don't have much money on me otherwise I would have struck at Rich by now half an hour ago Jens Shan said I have expelled zidi and now there is no one to disturb us that's good after all I am one of the eight generals and I didn't want to be accused of bullying the weak so I will give you 5 minutes to attack I will only defend not retaliate once said there's not turning back having finished his sentence Nana charged forward throwing a punch towards him of course after that she relentlessly punched and kicked continuing to assault him the surroundings were engulfed in the fire of her attacks he said I can't deny it little girl you hit hard but with this little force of attack you won't defeat me now the 5 minutes are up indeed 5 minutes were up but Nan had only managed to take 75% of his health she was frustrated damn it he smirked wickedly now it's my turn to strike his riding tiger swept at her sending Nana flying dozens of meters away buried in a pile of condensed excrement Nana huffed buried not even close to a million light years away if I can't defeat you now I won't stop fighting until I do she focused her mechanical absorption enhancing her own abilities let's see whose punch is harder your strength is much greater than before but still not enough both of them hurled their punches towards each other at the same time but Nana's punch only managed to take away a small amount of his health Nana's enhanced arm had shattered at this moment she was struck through several houses seeing this he shouted Ryan don't give her a chance to breathe n gritted her teeth sensing something unusual in her body damn it I still haven't absorbed enough metal I need more suddenly she realized ha my blood is healing itself could it be because the master injected nanomechanical cells into me they are automatically repairing the damage to my body she looked around and recognized where she had just been thrown this is a weapon shop I'm being smashed into a weapon shop again isn't this a perfect opportunity if so I won't hold back anymore at that moment Ryan had run over n smirked you arrived just in time let me take my anger out on you so my worry about lacking Firepower has been completely cured now n had now upgraded into a Female warrior goddess equipped with new weapons a minute of her fiery attack caused Ryan to lose 60% of his health Ryan screamed in pain meanwhile Nana suddenly thought earlier the master gave me leftover nanomechanical cells I just thought of an interesting idea after injecting Ryan with the drug the two returned to the site of the previous battle Jen Shan immediately asked what just happened that made such a terrible noise have you dealt with that annoying little one yet Nana laughed coldly and replied Ryan no that is its past life name now it is no longer Ryan but black Moonlight Jen Shan said what you dare to transform my Ryan into a life form damn Machinery unforgivable absolutely unforgivable Nana shouted angrily I will use all my strength to kill you he spoke while changing shape transforming into the giant form of the mountain however he could not attack the pet line from before nna smirked this is getting interesting black Moonlight bu him for me black Moonlight roared with a thunderous sound and then charged at his mechanical form ran quickly shouted don't force me damn it I underestimated you I never expected that someone so young could have such a cruel mind Nana scoffed her eyes full of mockery what if I have a cruel mind no matter how cruel I am you will never understand stand even in death he trembled and shouted stop it Ryan Don't force me to take action against you no matter what he said the tiger continued to bite and tear above the Flames from black Moonlight kept erupting causing continuous damage Nana growled don't dream anymore your Lion now belongs to me there's no saving it die taking advantage of his moment of distraction Nana immediately lunged forward and slashed several times at him he gritted his teeth and roared you dare to underestimate me I am not the same as before the eyes of black Moonlight were now filled with killing intent aiming straight at him Jen Shan tried to fly up to evade But ultimately was still bitten to death by the tiger zidu said although her feelings for her pet go beyond my therapeutic abilities that cannot conceal the crime she has committed she can only blame herself for wronging the wrong person in any world choices are always more important than efforts if there's nothing worth discussing I advise you not to waste your energy trying to hinder me after all what do you want to ask I will give you a few minutes as the pharmacology professor of the first district Academy you must be familiar with the name Anjo right Miss zoui perhaps you shouldn't mention that name in your school Zed we was surprised do you know my past it's not strange at all a few years ago when I joined the wui group I never hid my identity many people in K City know about my background she continued and Joo of course I know him he was the student I lik the most back then but indeed fate is playful he worked hard to become stronger after much toil and hardship he finally chose to appear in front of me have you met and Joe of course she replied that kid knelt before me crying and wailing begging me to help him grow stronger quickly I still remember helping him find his missing sister as if it were just yesterday and he even asked for help to be become stronger Annie said could it be that his monster transformation is related to you she nodded that's right moreover I was the one who guided him to make a PCT with the monster transformation that kid agreed without a second thought to find you hearing her speak like that the red-haired girl was Furious pointing her sword straight at zenui why don't you keep chopping the red-haired girl coldly continued I'm not that foolish killing you right now would cut off the clues about Anjo if it's your favorite student then why did you push it into the abyss Zen wood chuckled because I care I want to see just how much it can grow back then I had the monster transformation drug test panel from the deadly poison Society but this drug had many flaws I didn't want to waste a promising seed so I guided it to use monsters to quickly become stronger but I never expected it would take lives in the safe Zone as a condition to reach an agreement with the monster truly worthy of being my proudest student the greatest Masterpiece of mine the red-haired girl squinted her eyes coldly asking so where is it now zindy smiled and replied after it killed those who harmed you it came to see me once then set off to Sunset Canyon what happened afterward I don't know upon hearing this the red-haired girl sneered then you're useless saying that she swung her blade and sliced zedu too however from the severed body of zedua a mocking voice echoed is it starting now unfortunately it's useless no matter how many times stronger you are you can't kill me because no matter how sharp the sword is it cannot slice through the power of the poison swamp flowing within me zidu seemed to be resurrected but could not touch her body useless useless she growled at this moment the red-haired girl was diligently slashing but there were vulnerabilities all around her feet the toxins from her body were so strong that they formed a swamp at her feet is this swamp created by the fragments of your body why can't you escape Annie exclaimed in Surprise zenui emerged from the swamp laughing coldly surprised huh but perhaps I'm more surprised than you this deep swamp of mind is laced with deadly poison but why even though you've fallen into it does your blood not decrease at all is it because of the suppression level however even if I can't kill you I can trap you in this swamp for life slowly tormenting you slowly transforming you and then handing you over to the wui group he will surely be very pleased the red-haired girl replied confidently you want to transform me truly a twist of fate you no longer have a chance do you know why I am immune to your poison the red-haired girl smiled coldly because as has transformed me countless times the poisons of this world no longer affect me hearing this zenui angrily screamed is it possible that she saved you and then transformed you damn it that poison Club Bunch got here first how infuriating the red-haired girl remained calm looking straight at him that's right she deserves to die not only did she transform my body but she also gave me chaotic energy I never intended to use this energy in my life but to kill you I no longer need to hold back the purple poison on the red-haired girl is spreading zedu is gradually becoming poison this is the deadly toxin created by Ames it hurts so much my body feels like it's being burned zigu screams her whole body trembling the red-haired girl has changed the situation completely taking control she looks at zedu with a challenging voice although I can't cut through this swamp or escape with A's deadly poison spreading in the end will you sink to your death first or will I be poisoned before that zedu struggles to hold on her gaze full of helplessness but if you are willing to give me more information I need perhaps you still have a chance to survive Zen is unwilling but knows she has no other choice she says I already told you after angel came to find me I sent someone to track him to Sunset Canyon but in the end he was defeated and went missing by an unknown level Beast I really don't know anything else please please give me the antidote zigui begs her voice trembling the red-haired girl coldly laughs thank you for your information now if you still want live you can go find ases for the antidote zedu clutches her throat gasping are you tricking me she simply shrugs and replies succinctly so what if I do as she leaves she thinks of Anjo feeling a sense of sadness taken by an unknown level Beast where should I look for him now at this moment I can only fully rely on Yu seen change at the arena the three old men have also appeared but wa there's a new situation the three suddenly appear in the arena none other than the three generals Jan Le diun and sunfang it turns out the true purpose of this young man is precisely them youu stood facing the three strongest opponents among the generals he showed no sign of fear and calmly replied I have been prepared for a long time come on all three of you at once I don't have time to waste this challenge left the audience in the stands astonished this this guy is really insane he thinks he can take on all three of the strongest just because he defeated two 100 level guys another person mocked that kid is as good as dead he just made me lose all my money earlier hurry up and die meanwhile sunfang one of the three generals laughed triumphantly holding dual swords as he stepped forward it seems no one wants you to survive fine let me satisfy everyone's expectations to kill you just me alone is enough sunfang immediately charged his movements as quick as Lightning he aimed directly at Yu with a powerful attack but Yu promptly raised his shield to defend sunfang sneered your defense is decent but with your weak physical attack how can you withstand me as soon as he finished speaking Sun Fang's body suddenly Unleashed a powerful Whirlwind swirling the murderous intent towards yiu wind Yi Wu murmured lightly his gaze turning sharp sunun Fang stepped out of the tornado his voice filled with arrogance that's right my ability is wind as for you you will die in this gust as soon as he appeared zun Fang used a powerful overwhelming move but how would the young man counter it Yu stood still at the center calmly using a shield to protect himself was he relying on the natural system to counter the physical system seeing this sunfang laughed loudly do you think that's enough I never said I only knew how to attack physically immediately Yu's body erupted in Flames the fire from his body merged with the tornado making it even fiercer yeu smirk coldly wind belongs to Wood which breeds fire your wind will only make my Flames burn stronger is this Fanning the flame stop this beginner's play now against absolute strength this means nothing at all saying that Yu use Fanning the flame to enhance the power of the fire causing it to blaze fiercely he continued to provoke call your buddies over with this level of power you can only offer up your life surrounded by the fiery tornado sunfang found himself in a dangerous situation the blazing fire made him scream it's too hot I'm dying from the heat stop it however it was too late Sun Fang's Health dropped to 60% he bitterly thought to himself I was careless this y Woo is indeed not an ordinary person Soo against him I have no chance of winning but my body is trapped by the fiery tornado I can't escape suddenly another surge of power appeared extinguishing Yu's Flames completely the ability of some extraordinary warrior with formidable might next the Thunder of the great desolation suddenly struck directly at Yu this time the attacker was xen LE the treacherous blow caused yiu to bleed leaving him with only 85% Health the host stared in dis belief exclaiming oh my what did I just see this young man not only managed to suppress Lord Sun Fang but also easily block the attack from both Lord Jen Le and Lord dickon it seems the three great generals are about to strike together I wonder how he will cope with that in the stands people began to murmur excitedly who on Earth is this guy facing three great generals all by himself and not appearing to be at a disadvantage I'd never heard of anyone so for minable in K City where did he come from another voice interjected filled with frustration I don't care who he is I'd rather lose all my money I just want to see him die three great Lords kill him for us two old men sitting nearby showed clear signs of astonishment is it real or fake he just took a direct hit from Jen Le and is still fine this kid must be a monster it's truly infuriating this guy is not just good at making a show I believe has calculated everything very carefully to deal with someone like him we need all fre you work together his entire body ignited he held the staff saying don't hide your strength anymore use your ultimate move if not the other man then transformed into a monster the opponent replied in a challenging tone of course I will tear you to shreds the announcer's voice echoed heightening the excitement here it comes this is the complete form that the three great generals can only achieve when they unleash their full power something seen only in Legend this overwhelming strength lives up to the reputation of the strongest triangle among the eight generals as he spoke while adjusting his hat he realized the situation was spiraling out of control but the scale of the upcoming battle could very well exceed the capacity of the Arena we kindly ask the audience to temporarily leave the arena for safety don't worry we will still be broadcasting the spectacular images live right here stay tuned the audience sensed that something was wrong and began to flee in panic hurry up and go one person shouted this duel is too dangerous staying here you might not live to see it but some people hesitated feeling regret a battle of this level if you miss it you may not have the chance in your entire life one person said anyway every day I lick blood off the blade let's see what happens if you want to see then watch the greatest show I want that kid blood to flow like a river a woman in the room held a glass of wine took a sip and slowly said for the first time I see those three being pushed to this extent so what will you do next y wo Yu replied that's what makes it interesting I'm serious here otherwise it would disappoint the audience yiwu's entire being seemed to be a blaze the temperature in the surrounding area noticeably increased he frowned slightly and thought to himself that kid's abilities are too counteractive given the current situation I can't possibly win on the other side a large-bodied old man charged Trey ahead he shouted don't be afraid this is no longer a matter of Elemental counters don't you see I'm also on fire let's follow the plan immediately all three harness their combined strength under the pressure of the move the Earth shatters the ground split open with a large crack Yu quickly soared into the air but was still bombarded by the opponent's skills well done now it's my turn I'm going all out as he spoke he prepared to use extreme cold wave to freeze his opponent however before he could execute it an unexpected object shot towards him to attack Yi Wu quick-witted used Earth seal shell followed by a lightning sphere and a thunder strike inside at that moment the commentator nearly wanted to LEAP out of the Arena the three commanders have used their ultimate moves and finally managed to seal y Wu with such a deadend situation does he still have a chance to turn the tables even I an experienced commentator cannot predict the next developments audience I'm about to run out of patience the woman standing on the wall could not hide her anxiety usually as long as they work together aside from the boss no one can escape death by a hair's breath however the current situation feels like battling a dungeon boss and this boss is none other than Yu he hasn't even counterattacked so so far suddenly the seal surrounding yiu exploded yiu emerged his sharp gaze directed at his opponents is this your strategy the plan and execution have almost no flaws but in reality there is still far too much lacking after a battle Yu's blood was still at 60% hard to believe the three of us should combine forces we can't suppress him and he hasn't even used ancient god yet if he's fighting so easily what else is there to fight he said perhaps only Master wuj Has the strength to contend with him the strategy is to retreat we must quickly get master wuji out suddenly a voice echoed want to run without my permission someone said what is this force it feels like a black hole where am I just now everything was dark and I ended up here what exactly happened another person replied it's ye W's ability in an instant we were sucked into the huge dark flame Fireball he said but that's all it is I'm just trapped as long as I'm not killed there's still a chance Yu's voice rang out coldly it seems you don't understand your situation the true power of the dark flame Burns through all time and space are you ready to welcome the rest of your lives here sunfang furiously shouted what nonsense are you talking about no matter if he's real or fake I won't just sit and wait to die sunfang and dickun were simultaneously throwing punches at Yu's Apparition fake at this moment yiu gradually faded from their sight in front of you I am merely a shadow I do not wish to harm you yet you attack me wholeheartedly the more you struggle the more fatigued you will become and you will die even sooner in any case the rest of your lives will be spent here Mr L replied then I don't need to hold back anymore suddenly a worried voice rang out wait Mr Le do you intend to use that ultimate move your body won't be able to withstand it Mr Le answered his voice trembling but Resolute ancient doctrine of primordial a multitude of lightning bolts struck down in the space in this desperate situation what is there to fear and trying another person exclaimed in panic even his strongest move won't have any effect are we truly unable to escape from here Mr L's body trembled a faint smile on his lips you are indeed formidable I have summoned all my strength but I still can't break the situation you have set up you have won with your power killing us is as easy as flipping a hand yet at this moment you choose to imprison us is there some scheme behind this y wo remained cold not answering directly I have my own calculations you do not need to know but even if I do not kill you being trapped here is equivalent to death he gritted his teeth unwilling to accept then not necessarily wait for master wui to come and kill you and we will be saved yigu smirked his gaze mocking do you really have faith in your senior wui he said of course it is precisely because that Noble person granted US Supreme power that we have become the eight generals of mui regarding your strength we absolutely trust unconditionally no matter how strong you are you definitely cannot defeat him Yu replied if you say so I look forward even more to battling him you should hold on to your hopes and wait here for good news from him saying that he began to gradually vanish what is happening the three great generals of wuji disappeared in an instant did they flee or were they defeated but regardless the Victory and defeat have been clearly determined the champion of the final battle is the young man yuu who appeared like a dark horse out of nowhere the audience had nearly all fled no one wanting to lose their life damn it who cares about a champion or not the spearhead strategy of wui has been defeated by that guy Keo city is about to change the sky someone shouted that guy is no ordinary person he is about to become a killing Powerhouse I don't want to be implicated run fast amidst the chaotic scene the woman jumped down she said you are indeed impressive it seems I made the right choice yugu replied I have never let those who trust me down she looked into to the deep pit beneath her feet and asked are they still alive Yu affirmed they are not dead just trapped in this space she smiled derisively isn't wuji fond of playing kidnapping games I will return the favor to test the humanity of this senior she listened and couldn't help but frown this is what we call an eye for an ie isn't it after all ryoan and sawatari were killed by his accomplices and now only these three hostages remain wui though Sinister is quite forgiving towards the eight generals he personally chose he trusts them and considers us like family perhaps he really will offer them something after all Yin Wu was a bit curious family I can't see that but wuji seems to have a sense of humanity moreover from what Jen Le said your powers were all granted by wui what kind of person is he really she replied we were originally a group of unrelated people in the wilderness but we came together due to wuji's personal interests he calculated using some method our birth dates and differentiated our corresponding abilities one could say he is our Master but wui is a very complex person hard to read in addition to his obsessive pursuit of power to the point of distortion he also requires us to play the role of his family for example my character is the sister Jen Le is the stern Father and Son Fang is the unreliable younger brother wui has set up a default family for himself she said said it's like a family affair but it only stays that way when his mood is good if his mood turns bad he might kill anyone without Mercy while we may not be in Peril of being killed we certainly can't escape the chills that run down our spines so everyone both respects wuji and lives in fear and anxiety Yi Wu cued his face and thought of himself this wuji guy is rather Twisted it's very likely that he lacked familiar love while growing up which has led to this bizarre relation ship between him and the eight generals the hostage was originally just a spur of the- moment thought now it seems to be an important Pawn she continued I'll ask you one more time are you sure you want to go to the central tower in the black District wuji's abilities can surpass your imagination what awaits you is definitely a major challenge have you thought it through y Wu replied bluntly of course because that's where my family is imprisoned no matter how dangerous it is I must go she handed him kn and said if that's the case then I'll honor my promise this is the key to the secret passage and the map that the architect of kigo City gave me long ago the entrance is marked on this map I've kept it for many years and finally I get to use it Yu accepted it and responded with this preparation it seems you had plans from the start but do you really wish to see me defeat wui and overthrow kegos the girl wrapped her arms around herself having realized that wuji was Bec becoming increasingly insane and impulsive I truly fear the day he loses control if any powerful being dares to challenge him I would be more than willing to watch because I only care about my own life and death who takes control of K city is of no concern to me if someone appears someone stronger than him I would not hesitate to betray him ye Wu turned to leave understanding I really like your straightforward personality well then I'll take my leave first suddenly a notification came through Mr lie requests to connect with you ye woo tapped on the screen Mr lie long time no see why are you suddenly reaching out now he said it's not good Master Ling Yuan has found Wang Jen and Wang Jen is a level 240 Powerhouse your current situation is very dangerous where are you right now I just recently escaped their surveillance when we meet I will share the details with you Yu replied no need for you to sh beare The Authority just let Ling Yuan and Wang Jen come to me and I will speak directly with them he laughed this guy is really interesting now I look forward to you even more how much joy can you bring me in battle she said it's easy to see my scheme but don't get too complacent y wo the day we found you is the day you must die y wo responded his eyes full of challenge no need for such trouble if you want to find me just come to K City I'm here but but you better not keep me waiting too long as for things on this side I'm about to wrap them up he stared intensely at the screen his gaze icy especially you Ling Yuan I once gave you a chance when we meet you better be mentally prepared because death is waiting for you at the same time in the laboratory of the skyscraper in the dark Zone Tian Kon was nervously directing the harmonization rate has reached 190% at this rate we can finish before midnight finally the endless days of hard work are about to come to an end hooray he typed rapidly his eyes locked on the screen while also reminding don't be careless this is the most crucial moment if anyone dares to make a mistake you will bear the consequences yourselves the scientist replied in unison understood chai kin couldn't hide his excited smile he eagerly said the ideal that hang has always dreamed of is finally about to become a reality the sweet fruit is right in front of us the path to wuji's dominance over the world will begin today ha at the critical moment a series of red alerts continuously appeared accompanied by the emergency sound of the system warning warning the fusion ratio has suddenly dropped to 0% the experiment is about to be forcibly terminated tin Ken anxiously looked at wuji's figure in the experiment chamber and shouted what is happening why has the fusion ratio suddenly decreased wui slowly removed his oxygen mask in the experiment chamber and calmly replied there's no need to panic tan K I have forcibly cut off the fusion time Ken stared at wuj in shock his face filled with confusion Master Wu how are you awake but why did you have to forcibly cut off the fusion we were just a little bit away from achieving great success the door of the experiment chamber opened wui at level 180 stepped out without a shred of clothing his cold gaze fell on Tian Chan as he gently asked back are you doubting my methods tyan K and the other scientists in white lab coats recognized the threat in wuu words fearfully kneeling down and bowing their heads in apology we dare not please forgive us Master wuji the Grim expression on wuji's face faded instantly he broke into a bright smile and commanded get up I know you are unwilling to stop at this point but I did this because I sensed a tremendous Force approaching Tian Kean quickly opened the map on the screen pointing at the positions marked with red X analyzing a great power is approaching could it be y wo and janl what are they really doing how is this possible besides me and can could it be that the other six have all been killed by him upon saying this time Killen's face turned pale due to his own thoughts wuji at this moment was using technology to to equipped himself with a set of battle armor hearing the news that his allies had been killed he was heartbroken tears streaming down his face have our brothers Fallen Jen Le dickun sunfang ryozen zidu li who if in this life we cannot be family then let us be truly family in the next life rest assured everyone's sacrifice will not be in vain the world over there will witness the path to Greatness of wuji at that moment kayak laboratory suddenly experienced an abnormality KU exite kept coughing cough cough cough as the coughing echoed numerous bubbles began to rise in the laboratory wua anxiously asked what's wrong with her CH K observed closely and reassured it might be a side effect from severing the fusion no need to worry I will handle it immediately wui approached kayak's laboratory reaching out to touch the glass pane murmuring the life of this woman is more important than anyone else's there mustn't be any mistakes as long as she is here obtaining the ancient God's possession is just the beginning the innate Talent she possesses is a rare gift in this world with her I feel like I can do anything a woman like her is worthy of Me wui Tan Ken carefully typed on the processing keyboard quietly assessing Kaki status in wuji's heart in his mind he told himself master wui has never shown interest in any woman this time he values this woman so much it seems I must be cautious in my dealings he paused for a moment thinking further as for y woo even if she kills six others and obtains their seals she still won't be able to open the central door of this tall tower there's no need to worry for now suddenly a cold voice interrupted wuji's train of thought whether she is worthy or not you don't get to decide Yu with a fierce expression walked in accompanied by two girls she fixed her Gaze on wui her voice Cold Yet filled with disdain you dare to use Kai as a tool for someone to seize the ancient God's possession your head is growing bigger than even mine the girl with black hair tied in two sides stood with her hands on her hips her eyes blazing with anger loudly declaring you dare to treat sister KY exai like a toou I will not let you off Tian Kon was startled and turned around his mechanical arms firing out bright Sparks like cannons he stared intently at Yu's group preparing to attack how did you know about that hidden door could it be damn it that can sassy actually dared to betray time K gritted his teeth in anger I had already suspected that woman was untrustworthy muuji stood on the high platform and suddenly commanded tyen Kanan all right Tian Kean with me here you don't need to take action time Keon stepped back wuji smiled at y Wu below and spoke so you are y Wu it turns out you can indeed sense an aura belonging to a powerful being yiu did not bother to look at wuji instead focusing on observing the experimental samples around him he replied indifferently on the contrary you were somewhat disappointing I originally thought wuji could capture an ancient god after all you are a powerful being above level 200 I didn't expect only level 180 so where exactly did you pick up this ancient god treasure the smile on wuji's face suddenly vanished but he did not get angry merely continuing this level of provocation can be spared you understand the significance of the ranking system better than I do however one thing you are correct about this ancient god was indeed something I picked up Yu's voice brushed past in Surprise ah I was just speaking casually who knew it would actually be true yet wui recounted the origin of the ancient god to yiu when I was around your age I was just an ordinary wild hunter but by chance I discovered this ancient god in an ancient ruin at that time the ancient god was severely injured and half of its body seemed to have turned to stone for some unknown reason my body formed a covenant with the ancient god and from then on I was bestowed the power it granted I shared that immense power with eight people of my choosing ever since the entire Wilderness in the southwest region has been under my control after listening Yu looked directly into wuji's eyes and asked so this is the source of your power I can only say you were very fortunate but why would you reveal such an important matter to an enemy like me wuji smiled once more haha ordinary people gain power by coincidence but in reality it's not just luck they are chosen by that force of power the reason I'm telling you this is that you are also someone chosen by the ancient god between us I'm sure there will be many common goals and topics Yu smirked and said I'm not someone chosen by the gods nor do I have any Grand goals I'm just an ordinary person wanting to protect my family from the moment you took my family away there is only one topic left between us you must die wuji disregarded Yu's arrogant words treating him like a junior he laughed and said haha if I really wanted to harm your family they wouldn't have lived to see today I'm just taking this opportunity to meet you it's normal for reckless and aess youth like you you just need a proper Guidance with that wui extended his hand inviting Yu come be part of my family those chosen by the heavens like us should stand at the top of the food chain controlling this world according to our own meaning y Wu didn't want to linger any longer and decisively summoned his weapon all right I got my path I will walk on my own I don't need anyone else's guidance for now the exchange process with the boss before the fight is is over can we fight now wuja looked at yiu his laughter growing louder haha I thought you and I were the same kind of people but it seems you are just a narrow-minded self-righteous fool if you're not going to cooperate then don't blame me for using Force to seize the ancient God's power from you Wu said then channeled his power a golden light enveloped his arms the girl with her hair tied at both sides raised her gun and fired in succession what ancient god are you talking about let's see how you fight when your source of power is destroyed first the fierce Beast beside her also coordinated the attack in an instant a Vortex suddenly appeared in front of them the bullets Shot Through The Vortex hitting somewhere else the tall building on the other side of the vortex suddenly collapsed under the powerful Firearms impact crashing down the girl with her hair tied at both sides was taken aback by the scene before her astonished why did the scene suddenly change this place is y looked up at the city before him exclaiming this place is from the era before the Earth Network era occurred but this kind of power that suddenly shifts Space is really too buggy Wu Jay hovered in the air before them adjusted the vortex to close then spoke to be precise this place is an ancient god illusion the things you see are the results of the free development of humanity but whether it is neglecting natural self-destruction or the sudden Descent of the earth Network era both lead from one type of Destruction to another essentially they are both manifestations of energy IM balance and my ultimate goal is to erase this mistaken conclusion he said to build a new world where energy and Order reach a state of Perfect Balance this is also the ultimate mission that the ancient God has bestowed upon me you looked at the worshipful demeanor of the person before him and coldly asked what is the name of this ancient god of yours behind wui a gigantic monster resembling a frog appeared the person wore solid iron armor and wuah raised both hands speaking in a powerful voice as one who possesses the strength of the ancient god before you die youve have the right to know his name infinite origin unified ywu instinctively placed a hand on his left chest feeling my heart just trembled strongly wui looked at Yu with great interest seemingly aware of the unusual situation he was in oh is it because you heard the true name of the ancient god that you reacted it seems that the ancient god who formed a pack with you is still very vibrant yiu remains silent only sensing the changes within his body just now I did indeed feel Len reacting to the name primordial origin Unity is this because they were all separated from the subject of Destruction now I know there are two ancient gods in this world one in the world of the Shadow King what forms have the other 10 ancient gods taken in which worlds do they exist and who holds them ye W continue to think if ancient gods can be found by humans it also means they can be discovered by demon beasts the demon beasts encountered recently regardless of their level or scale are much higher than the historical records from the past few hundred years it's as if a sudden mutation has occurred could this prove that demon beasts also have ancient gods thinking about it is truly terrifying while yiwu was still pondering the system's voice unexpectedly rang out the current event has activated the system's hidden task mechanism Gathering three ancient gods can unlock the ultimate King account Yu entered the system space curiously looking at the locked card in front of him ultimate King account the conditions for unlocking it are so strict my strength must absolutely reach the heaven defying level right the system responded mysteriously specific details cannot be disclosed if you want to obtain it please strive to meet the unlocking conditions host y Wu cracked his knuckles excitedly Whispering are you trying to make things difficult for me again all right I'm curious to see which is stronger the ultimate King account or my own Shadow King when facing the destruction Master wuji manipulated the light in his hand casting a dark gaze at yiwu who remains silent what are you spacing out for as someone who holds an ancient god could it be that you still find this ancient god illusion strange Yu didn't understand and asked again what does this mean wuah looked at yiu as if he were ignorant and immediately mocked him it seems you truly know nothing can't your ancient god show you the ancient god illusion in that illusion it will reveal its original wish to you so you can fulfill it for it only by fulfilling that wish will the power of the ancient god truly belong to you you don't even know such a basic thing I'm starting to doubt whether you are truly the one chosen by the ancient god you began to channel this power strong purple lightning surrounding him he looked at wuji with a disdainful gaze and said whether I know this or not doesn't matter the difference between you and me is that you are a tool of the ancient god while my tool is the ancient god itself the wishes of the ancient god are merely excuses for those Rebels who want to dominate the world if you provoke me your life can only come to an early end wui was amused by Yu's arrogant words and burst into wild laughter haha as the laughter ceased wuji appeared behind Yu swinging a fist coldly saying your verbal skills are indeed very strong before y Wu could make a move he felt the opponent attacking from behind he silently shouted in his heart so fast wuji punched fiercely causing the building across to collapse with a deafening Roar he sneered and said I hope your strength is as strong as your mouth wui raised his hand and three gigantic golden Fists s appeared in the air while rampaging wildly around he shouted in the end who is the tool prove it with your strength after finishing his words he unleashed the infinite wind rening fist the three enormous fists descended simultaneously destroying the surrounding buildings the citizens of the city were terrified and screamed as they fled in panic what's happening run quick the three fists obliterated everything in their path and charged straight towards yiu the area around yiu formed a gigantic purple Vortex yiu Unleashed his power controlling the vortex to charge directly at wui saying impressive those earlier attacks exceeded my expectations it seems your strength is not just at level 18 wui rushed towards yiu expressing admiration as he spoke we're the same I made the first move ambushing you one attack only took away 10% of your health this defense is truly monstrous Boom the purple energy of yiu collided with the powerful golden energy of wuji creating a terrifying explosion yiu shouted that's enough probing and flattery use your full strength let's quickly determine the Victor meanwhile wuji maintained a mocking demeanor why the hurry I still want you to play with me a little longer like members of a family enjoying some intimate fun the girl with her hair tied on both sides outside the battle shouted loudly to encourage go on Master kill that guy who harmed sister key XI the girl with red hair part of Yu's group was swept up by the energy waves from a distance her hair blowing fluttering wildly in excitement is this really the battle between highlevel powerhouses even I can hardly see the speed at which they are delivering their blows Ty K from the crowd watching scoffed at guwu kill the mighty wui are you dreaming although their apparent strengths seem equal the situation is completely in wuji's hands because all of Yu's attacks are being effortlessly deflected by wuji sure enough wuji's hands transformed fluidly dismantling Yu's attacks one after another yiwu's face grew darker as he fought while Wu became more and more exhilarated great great your power is magnificent and tyrannical showcasing the Vitality of Youth if we are just talking about strength you are completely above me but fighting cannot rely slly on strength you know wuji swiftly darted past ywu swinging his claw to grab him but y Wu managed to evade today let you experience a bit Yi Wu said the Adult World experiences the long distance wuji suddenly descended both feet tracing a circle on the ground then Unleashed a punch that sent y Wu flying yiwu's body became like a flashing light crashing heavily into a distant skyscraper a spiderweb likee crack spread across the the wall of the building yiu was hit leaving only 40% HP the girl with pigtails panicked and shouted Master yiu lay in the small hole on the wall struggling to wipe his mouth with his hand in this era the essence of Youth and Adolescence is not different only differing in ideas and actions you chose to use technical softness to overcome hardness well I chose Brute Force to the very end as Yu spoke he Unleashed a violent purple energy from his body it forcefully Swept Away the surrounding dirt and Stones forming a massive purple beam of light that shocked straight up into the sky piercing through the clouds yiwu's body transformed into the flame Shadow Emperor form a huge pitch black figure with blue light in the chest and on the head resembling Flames fiercely blazing wuah looked up oh so you're finally serious now Tian Keon sensed the powerful Aura spreading his face pale oh so you're finally serious this overwhelming Aura Yi Wu has such methods he said Master wui be careful however this form of Yi Wu did not frighten wuji on the contrary it made wuji feel even more excited haha now who resembles the antagonist more no matter how big your transformation is it will be useless I can still easily neutralize your attack wo's eyes flickered with a fake green light his face expressionless don't be too quick to conclude the giant transformation is just a process to go through immediately after a powerful green black energy surged intertwining and converging into a point in the middle of the sky as if being drawn to the same spot Tien Ken stood Frozen looking up at the powerful swirling energy in the sky the volume of energy is shrinking the density is increasing he he is trying to compress this enormous energy down to the size of an ordinary person as the energy was accumulated Yu's body also returned to its original size his whole body was enveloped in a blue electric current swirling around him and he provocatively laughed come on the second stage of the battle begins flame Shadow Emperor second form demonic flame reverse kill Yi Wu excitedly shouted come here the second stage has begun wuji felt perplexed in the second stage this person does not rely on the power of the ancient god but has been able to unlock a transformation for where does his power come from suddenly yiu disappeared and wuj immediately spoke up do you think disappearing in hiding can deceive me Nave I can sense Your Existence through the flowing currents of power show yourself after saying that he used the void breaking Venom stab technique suddenly Yi Wu reappeared both dragon heads showing up at once one Dragon immediately bit wuji's hand causing him to scream in pain then ywu Unleashed the flame Shadow Demon dragon attack sending wuji flying away the other Dragon quickly bit wuji's body pushing him across the laboratory before finally slamming him hard against the wall the wall immediately collapsed and wuj sat down gasping for breath damn it this overwhelming magical power at my current stage is really hard to cope with suddenly yiu appeared from behind mocking wuji what's wrong where is the skillful power that you pride yourself F didn't you boast before that you could resolve any attack it seems that once the power exceeds your limits you can't exert any effect wuji was Furious and he immediately used wind blade to slash Yu's body you still smell like milk stop being so smug yiu smiled and said smug no this is strength as he said that he gathered his power and struck towards Wu Annie was astonished she couldn't believe in just an instant the situation has turned so dramatically Nan observed the battle neither of them can intervene tan kin couldn't believe his eyes frightened he shouted Lord wui is caught in a bitter battle he is not completely in a disadvantageous position no it can't be Lord wui Is Our Hope how could you fail despite receiving that blow Wu remained standing he laughed proudly haha I never expected that one day wuji would be looked down upon if there exist exists a gap in magic power between us it is time for the people I trust the most to demonstrate your loyalty wua raised his hand to the sky Gathering a massive amount of power and shouted for the great cause of ours return the power that I bestowed upon you back to me the strength within Tian K's body was immediately drained away he painfully slumped to the ground oh Lord wuji why did you strip away the strength you granted us we are so small can we really survive until the great cause is fulfilled a Nana saw Tian killan weakening so rapidly and felt anxious Annie immediately explained the strength of the eight generals comes from Wu now that wua has suddenly withdrawn that source of power those who have undergone training aside someone like him definitely won't be able to withstand this kind of shock suddenly the strength of N and Annie was also syphoned away Nana was panicked not understanding what was happening Annie explained that's not our strength but the power of the two we defeated in the eight generals wui after reclaiming all the strength immediately leveled up to 220 haha my power has returned it's been so long since I felt this surge of magic if I had known these guys were so useless I shouldn't have shared my power with them playing this boring family game indeed the most reliable thing is still myself ha hearing this Yi Wu drove his sword and said then you are one who does doesn't understand what family means if your power is restored we don't need to waste any more time one move to determine the Victor wuji immediately shouted that suits me come on let me use the power of the ancient god to send you back to dust saying that both of them immediately rushed towards each other two colossal forces collided creating a massive explosion wuji threw the gigantic ring towards ywu he struggled to withstand it but was still overwhelmed by his strength Wu laughed loudly haha the ancient god power I possess completely surpasses Your Shadow flame power at the moment Yi Wu was holding on his sword had broken in half wuji shouted your time of death has come Yi wo Yi wuo immediately grabbed the ring and bit down on it refusing to let go seeing this wui was Furious what using your mouth to bite my ancient god magic ring your foolishness is an insult to the ancient god before he could finish his sentence the ring shattered instantly Wu looked at the scene before him in disbelief how could this be he sat down on the ground stunned the ancient God's power granted to me was destroyed by you in such a barbaric manner since the ring had shattered his level dropped to only 180 and his health also decreased to just 20% ye Wu approached and mocked him it seems that your ancient god did not grant you all power a cool like you has now lost its usefulness wuji was very angry but he still tried to maintain his arrogant demeanor and said even if you win against me so what from the moment you were pulled into this illusional world the ancient God has been imprisoned here forever unable to escape haha yiu panicked and shouted what wuji went crazy and yelled you will live in this illusional world for the rest of your lives until you die old being able to exist in this hopeful future is the Great greatest Grace that the ancient God has bestowed upon you Yi Wu immediately attacked wuji but he vanished tan seeing wuj leave despaired and shouted master wuj I'm still here please don't leave me here Master wuji Annie did not expect them to be trapped here so easily Nana quickly pulled out two cannons and loudly declared isn't this an illusion watch me use Firearms to break it y Wu immediately stop Nana saying don't waste your energy anymore let me handle this saying that he gather all his strength ye will realize that even though this illusional world isn't a skill that controls entities the entire city before him is a facade therefore he decided to use the strongest moo of the flame Shadow Emperor as a gamble then Yu unleashed the hell's Dark Flame the entire city began to crack and crumble leaving the group of Nana Wasing from afar in astonishment Nana exclaimed this power is truly unbelievable to be able to destroy an entire city with a single strike so impressive Master we can definitely get out tin Tron seeing that source of power shouted in Anger why why is it that someone so powerful is yiu and not master wui how frustrating a moment later Yu's power had annihilated the entire city but illusional only showed a few cracks Yu gassed and as he crawled out from the rubble muttering no even if I destroy illusional like this I still can't break through damn it seeing this tyen Ken immediately sneered ha no matter how powerful you are you still can't break illusional of the ancient god you can't win against Master wuji without your interference our Master will surely succeed in seizing the ancient god fulfilling our Grand Mission n angrily retorted huh you fool you're being sold by someone and you're counting their money for them can't you see the current situation y wo suddenly spoke up I haven't admitted defeat yet after saying that he took out the summoned magic Crystal of the new god this is my last resort if even this is useless then I can only admit defeat immediately he shouted come forth big eye won as soon as he finished speaking the Heavenly eye demon goblen appeared Tian Kon was utterly astonished by the scene unable to believe his eyes this this is am I seeing a living ancient artifact it's unbelievable he abruptly covered his eyes his voice trembling no no I can't look directly at the ancient god otherwise it will take my life but why did guwu only use the powers of the ancient God now is he really that confident how infuriating on guwu side he turned to laen urging Len hurry and help us get out of here Len let out a thunderous Roar and opened his eye wide staring intently at a point in the elusory space he concentrated all his power causing the space at that point to fracture it's a success y Wu exclaimed but the crack is too small we can't get out hearing this Len immediately gathered all his strength causing the space crack to widen significantly finally a large enough Escape Route appeared they all felt this time we will definitely succeed suddenly the CRA slowly began to close surprising everyone this spatial crack was quickly retracting are we really going to be trapped here this time Len seeing this roared in Anger blood streaming from its eyes it used its tentacles to try to break the crack everyone was quite surprised by this action Nana cried urging Len to hang in there it was their hope yiu anxiously thought even L Ken had to expend some strength just to barely open the crack cuz could this be a sign of the ancient god was it because that God was inherently above Len or because the reality of that God was actually that formidable in any case y encourage Len keep it up big eye if you can successfully break free from this illusion this time I will definitely help you achieve it as for wuji he had returned to the laboratory his subordinates rushed over to ask Master wuji you're back but how come you are so severely injured wui told them just ignore me quickly start the fusion experiment his subordinates immediately refused you are so severely injured how could you not take care of your health moreover the last experiment was just forcibly cut off starting it again now may encounter issues besides Master tianan is not here either wui angrily shouted do you dare to disobey my orders I told you to do it so just do it the subordinate hurriedly clarified this little one does not dare I am just worried about your body we will immediately activate the harmonization please step into the laboratory wua entered the laboratory and commanded his subordinates to raise the successful harmonization ratio to the highest level this time he wanted all the power of kayaki to belong to him the subordinates immediately complied the successful harmonization ratio has been adjusted to the highest level but I fear that the body responsible for enhancing the effect will not be able to endure for long no matter just increase the concentration of the microbi solution to the maximum at least we must let her hold on until Master wuji successfully seizes the ancient god the group quickly activated the harmonization machine and the power of Kai it began to be drawn away the current harmonization ratio is 20% her body started to feel discomfort the harmonization ratio continues to increased to 40% wuji struggled to accept the power of kaixi the current harmonization ratio is 60% a moment later the harmonization ratio reached 80% however the equipment suddenly shook violently several subordinates jumped up in panic damn the equipment is about to reach its limit hurry up Master wui we are just a bit away the announcement echoed the final harmonious ratio has finally reached 100% Wu has successfully attained his Transcendence the Lackey rejoiced shouting success master wui has finally succeeded the ancient god with a body full of killing intent was continually surrounded by a powerful source of dark energy dazzling lightning flashing in the terrifying scene he spoke haha finally the Transcendence is successful now I am both wui and the ancient god with the power of the ancient god the day of claiming Supremacy over the world is eagerly awaited I will become the god of the new era the crowd below was extremely excited chant in Long live wui long live wui our path to Greatness is finally about to begin a grain of sand in the universe dares to dream of becoming a deity the ancient god approached wuji closely and spoke with a tone full of malice hearing those words wuji was astonished and turned to him exclaiming in surprise you are the ancient god how is that possible wasn't your Consciousness supposed to have vanished why do you still appear in my consciousness the ancient god coldly replied vanished Consciousness indeed after the Great War our true Consciousness has long since disintegrated even if it fragmented into this body it only retains a trace of Consciousness the ancient God said to extend my life I can only use the last Ray of Consciousness to attract the surrounding beings and you are merely a pathetic worm passing by forced by me to enter a false perception what is called a Chosen One Of Heaven how ridiculous even if you were once a demon Beast I would still Grant it the power to serve me wuji said no it can't be you're lying to me as he spoke wuji clutched his head showing extreme Agony the ground around him began to crack I will kill you the ancient god used his hand to hold his head in place and said I am indeed lying to you but you have performed better than I expected even vainly hoping to seize my Divine body humanss are truly a greedy species but that is precisely why you give me the opportunity to occupy your Consciousness although your Consciousness is weak and not yet enough to control the remaining power in this Divine body as long as I can act freely I can continuously absorb this planet until I fully recover upon hearing these words wua angrily exclaimed indeed you should not underestimate the power of the Gods I may have lost but in the end I have one final request can you keep a trace of my Consciousness even if it's just one eye I want to witness you standing at the Pinnacle of the world restoring order to the world his entire body has now become terrifying around him blood vessels bulge thickly hearing this the ancient god replied I can promise you consider it a reward for working for me but this planet is only a stepping stone I want to recover in the nest of the entire universe Wu began to infiltrate the ancient God's hand around them continuous streams of red lightning appeared in the laboratory the researchers shouted in panic a what is happening the data of the ancient god is extremely distorted it is absorbing electrical energy and master wuji's Vitality is rapidly weakening what on Earth is going on another person yelled no need to care anymore run for your lives master wui has failed to possess him and now the ancient god is furious run quickly the people in the laboratory scrambled to escape the SE scene around them became chaotic the ancient god approached grabbing an unconscious female body he said is this woman a power enhancement machine is this body to be used for my possession then what can she do for me saying that he exerted his power over her a huge source of green energy spread out around them he roared excitedly ha that person continued even I can sense an unprecedented amplitude of strength it's been over a thousand years since I've felt this comfortable with her my plan will be accelerated haaha the people below were horrified exclaiming quick look at what that monster is is it possible that the earthquake just now was caused by it run away it has already destroyed the black zone of kagu the next Target must surely be the other areas they scattered in panic as they saw the ancient god appearing in a ferocious State around him emanated a murderous aura that filled everyone with Dread the group on how shou's side looked at the situation before them with great concern how Shou spoke up is that big guy the ancient god of wuji could it be that y Wu has failed Sao G standing beside him exclaimed in panic no way absolutely impossible yiu cannot fail Zen Chen quickly added Yi Wu hasn't even given the order perhaps he is facing some obstruction Lan King Yun worriedly continued wait don't act rashley let's hide and wait for Yu's command on mik's side a silent prayer arose in his heart Heaven Help Us y woo senior must come out safe and sound I bet my life on you firearms from the military continued to fire relentlessly the commander received the information his face shocked yelling loudly what the ancient God has lost control is the ancient god still alive or dead damn it unleash all firearms shoot that monster for me as soon as he finished speaking those standing behind immediately responded seriously yes the ancient god was growing stronger he resisted the firearms and cannon fire from humans his face dangerous one hand he raised to the sky preparing to launch an attack he coldly said insignificant humans let you see the power of true divine power haha The Arrogant laughter of the ancient god echoed loudly the magic around him increased creating a swirling Vortex with brilliant purple circles powerful enough to seem like it could cut through the wind in another Corner the old man Zen Li rubbed his forehead his voice relieved we are saved next to him a large man spoke up that is the ancient god master wui has finally succeeded it turns out that Master wuji did everything for the final possession once the great cause is completed our strength can also be restored right looking at the scene before him laju Jin Le sudden L panicked his voice trembling as he yelled that Gaye no that's not the ancient god run now boom boom boom a powerful blow struck straight down to the ground a beam of purple light causing Earth and stones to fly everywhere the cracks became more and more apparent spreading all over Ki kept shouting loudly trying to evacuate the people around she yelled hurry up use the underground secret passage to get out just a little over 10 minutes and you can escape the city go quickly I'm afraid the passage won't hold for long the young girls looked at their mother anxiously asking what about you mom she replied her voice firm I have my own way based on the coordinates I sent you all should find a safe shelter wait there for me hearing this they hurriedly responded Yes we will go right away in the meantime the woman's mind was constantly disturbed by anxious thoughts sighing deeply she whispered Foo losing real power feels so unfamiliar what are you doing y woo if even you can't stop the ancient god I'm afraid none of us will escape death at the cliff outside kigo City a teleportation gate suddenly appeared from there a mysterious group of people stepped out they smiled faintly their voices filled with implication is it a step too late slow intelligence perhaps but who would have thought that in this remote southwestern place lay two ancient gods the person next to them spoke up this ancient God has clearly lost control do we need to intervene upon hearing this one of them said let's observe first in intelligence there is a person who appears alongside the ancient God we will wait for him and this ancient god to determine the outcome before we proceed with our retrieval he continued wh I can sense an extremely powerful demon Beast energy emanating from over 10 km away this made the white-haired man next to him chuckle lightly and reply haha it seems that Restless fellow wants to join the fun too let them be we will watch this Grand play unfold and take action afterwards during times of human chaos soon there will be no one left standing right wipe them all out the group of demon beasts from afar began to advance towards their target suddenly from the sky sunu appeared with great Authority she shouted silence our Target this time is not the humans but the ancient god if anyone one dares to disobey orders I will make them suffer more than humans the demon beasts trembled in fear and replied in unison yes yes sununu's gaze turned towards the ancient god in her mind she thought the high concentration liquid magic crystals are only enough to maintain the form of the esteemed one but not to the point of dissolving only by absorbing the power of the ancient god can his injuries be completely healed at that time our demon Beast tribe can be revitalized and flourish from the sky a giant creature resembling an octopus was continuously passing through the teleportation gate heading towards the sight of the catastrophic disaster in the distance Yu's group was flying over the red-haired girl spoke up it's taken so long but we finally escaped from the illusional ancient god yiu was astonished by the scene exclaiming is this KGO City how did it end up like this his face turned cold and his gaze sharpened Yu said no matter whether you are wui or the ancient God now I will definitely not spare you he commanded everyone gather with Lan King Yun I will deal with this thing hearing that Anning replied all right Nat a nded and said you must kill it Yi Wu used the intercom and said hello is everyone okay from the other end how shui replied finally received news from you right now we are hiding in a corner of the city it's temporarily safe but with the level of Destruction caused by the ancient god this place won't hold for long do you need us to do anything yiu responded this situation is beyond our expectations wait for Nana and everyone to gather with you then quickly Retreat from KGO City don't get dragged into the fight how Shu I asked this enemy exceeds the level of previous ones is there any way to deal with it Yu spoke up my main goal is to save Kai as for whether I can defeat the Ancient God or not we'll just have to see at that moment c g ran over he said I believe in you you can win against it ye woo if even you can't do it the southwest region could become a hell I know now I absolutely won't let that happen Yu was about to take off when he thought to himself a city has turned into ruins but it still has the capacity to rebuild it cannot continue to be destroyed any further he pulled on his hatred and shouted it hey wua are you still in this guy's head how come just after a short while of not seeing you your selfworth has dropped like this did you get blood sucked and possessed by an ancient god were your previous words all just nonsense as he spoke Yi Wu flew rapidly towards the ancient god the Gaze of that being immediately shot a beam of light stray at him ywu dodged it and immediately prepared to launch a Counterattack an attack at this level won't hit us try this out Yi Wu then Unleashed a powerful strike with countless energy orbs rushing straight towards the ancient god his body was struck by the attack but only sustained light damage hemp regular attacks only cause such minor damage it seems the energy in the account of the Chen Emperor has been depleted too much during the elus body he opened his eyes wide in astonishment hey is that you quu your brother is at my place why not come over and chat upon hearing his words the other party angrily exclaimed the energy on you so that's it the host of Len a weak human combined with a timid ancient god losing its body leaving only Consciousness this combination is indeed interesting but it doesn't peep my interest in you I have more important matters to attend to saying that the ancient god immediately turned his back and left Yi Wu behind seeing the situation before him Yi Wu thought to himself is he heading towards the safe Zone wait could it be that his Target is the superc condensed liquid magic crystals it can't be wrong originally he was severely injured and the fastest way to recover is to absorb energy as an ancient god he can sense the large amount of liquid magic crystals beneath the safe Zone which is nothing strange never mind it's best that he can actively leave kigosi but on the W of the safe Zone I must find a way to deal with him the ancient God said shuttered and said hm what do you want to do wui I didn't keep your trace of Consciousness just for you to cause trouble hearing what he just said y Wu thought in his mind what is this guy mumbling about he continued could it be that wuji's Consciousness has not completely dissipated did my sarcastic words just now take effect inside wuji's body countless wounds and numerous wires were embedded all over him at this moment tin Khan was tirelessly operating the repair system he shouted loudly not until the very last moment absolutely do not give up Master wui though I hate you for taking away my powers and abandoning me I hate even more the idea of our years of accumulation being destroyed by someone else I absolutely will not allow it I don't care whether your feelings for me are real or fake all I know is that you pulled me back from the brink of death and gave me a home so keep fighting Master wuji until the very last moment of your life as he spoke tears streamed down Tien can's face and His Hands kept typing on the keyboard suddenly wuji shouted loudly gr gr around his body a violent surge of electricity suddenly burst forth kosin panicked and exclaimed what's happening your Consciousness why is it he was in pain clutching his head tightly with both hands below the scenery appeared desolate Fierce Flames engulfed the building buildings wuji spoke his voice horse even though I once abandoned you you still choose to believe in me tyen Keon don't worry with your support I will fight until the very last moment a part of wuji's Consciousness spoke out hearing that the ancient god angrily said what have you done that you can rely on the remnant Consciousness to seize control of half of my Divine body can't you see Yu this is the bond between me and my family that I must absolutely uphold you tra trous bastard as he spoke the ancient God's arm suddenly shock forward unleashing a brilliant burst of energy aimed directly at yiu seeing this yiu immediately charged forward and said you truly Make Me See You In a Different Light wuji I must also respond seriously to your enthusiasm Yu said come forth yavana a powerful opponent like never before unleashed the strongest single Target magic ywu summon the dark witch gavana a girl with pitch black hair and a stunning face hidden behind a mask her body incredibly seductive she responded to his words understood my master yavan said night dust Starry Sky vast by my name yavanna raised her staff high and uttered those words a magical Circle appeared right beneath her feet and countless allies were prepared to rise into the air as soon as she finished speaking the moon above immediately descended right where the ancient god stood he was called off guard and Stood Still that little dark witch can harness cosmic power you always surprise me the ancient god laughed loudly aha ye W look towards the ancient god speaking in a cold tone but no matter how powerful your magic is it is useless the natural power of qu inherently carries the ability to Monitor and nullify magical damage the ancient god laugh hardly his hands lifting the moon his gaze filled with arrogance you can't do anything to me seeing the situation yiu was slightly surprised and exclaimed it seems that it really is like that standing beside her Jiva clenched her fists her face clearly showing anger damn it even my ultimate spell can't defeat him right away truly he is an ancient god but even if he is an ancient god there must be weaknesses I will definitely find it she placed her hand over her eyes a magical Circle appearing with strange light emanating from her eyes then she spoke his information has appeared ancient god gayi level 777 origin unknown he controls natural power unleashing extremely powerful Elemental attacks with near absolute magic resistance and especially hates all metallic substances the weak point is the crystal in his chest she shouted so that's it the ancient god taking this form also exploits the amplitude increase of kexa As Long As We rescued kexi it will not be difficult to defeat him anymore the ancient God let out a rough Roar growling like a fury he violently swept away everything in front of him dirt and rocks flying into the air he laughed triumphantly and said haha is this the power of a god this time we'll see how you farare against me suddenly a severe pain struck his head the ancient god angrily shouted get out of my Consciousness wui my body and my power are not tools for you to toy with I have more important things to do the ancient god felt that his body could no longer move a type of ultra alloy restrainer enveloped his body binding him tightly the system reported this Ultra alloy restrainer has the ability to render any Target into a bound State suffering no harm but also unable to act for one minute at that moment I viz appeared beside Yu and spoke well done I this in battles for account exchanges like this this is the first time right hearing that I Vis smiled brightly and replied that's right Master then it's time to use the ultimate move now it's time for the shadow can to appear after a long time y Wu immediately summon the shadow K to join the battle the ancient god widened his eyes and stammered is this is this the flow of energy ancient God said no how is it possible it took me so long to escape to this planet how can I encounter it again then anent God frantically struggled damn it my Consciousness is about to be seized by it what are you really afraid of qu ye will bit into his hand he thought to himself it seems that ancient God has not forgotten the Stars shadow that shattered them but in the current state no matter how hard I try these alloy locks won't hold for even a minute y Wu Unleashed his power and shouted come forth Crimson Legion the people below continued to chant the entire space echoed with the Roar of ancient god the Crimson Legion appeared eyes bloodshot screaming die ancient god interrogated voice filled with rage heretic prison this power does not belong to you but the energy on you definitely belongs to it who are you really Yu boldly replied who I am is not important as he spoke he grasped the stone voice full of challenge what matters is that you have harmed those who should not be harmed after saying that Yu pulled out the stone and shouted loudly a thunderous explosion boom shook the entire space the ancient body of ancient god roared in agony he angrily shouted no matter who you are in the end you are just a human you cannot stop me wait until I fully recover even it must die y Wu thought silently is this the final struggle before escaping growth but even if it restores its original form after all it is still ancient god right now I can only unleash 20% of my power and there's no way I can suppress it what should I do just then the stone began to show large cracks Yu was astonished in an instant the stone shattered into pieces yiu quickly picked up kexi who was still naked at this moment kexi confused called out lwo y Wu gently replied it's all right now I will take you home KAG choked up and said said I think I just dreamed a very long nightmare in the dream everything was filled with Darkness coldness and suffering but in the end I saw a faint star guiding me I kept following it the light of the star grew brighter and finally I ran into a place filled with light Kai suddenly fell silent then gave Yu a passionate kiss suddenly she continued in a whisper wait for me there suddenly a surge of power erupted shaking the heavens y couldn't believe it watching the power continuously flow forth he thought to himself is this the output enhancement ability of kayaki even against a force as strong as the Shadow King could this ability still be effective the system suddenly announced the shadow K account has received a power boost within 3 minutes you can use the limited breakthrough ability unlocking the special skills specifically designed for ancient god star Shadow you looked at Kai XA with affection feeling that this was truly unimaginable then he asked has kayak fallen asleep seeing this ye Wu gently touched kx's forehead you wored hard kexi wait for me a little longer let me deal with this ancient god and then we can go back home after saying that Yu did not forget to conjure up an outfit for kayaki this outfit will lead you together with Nana and the others then y Wu dashed away promising I will be right back meanwhile the ancient god howled incessantly grow energy I want energy after enduring so much to be resurrected I cannot miss this opportunity but ye W stood in his way I know where you want to go but I cannot let a mad monster like you run off to destroy the S Zone you must die here the ancient god enraged Unleashed a terrifying wave of power unexpectedly humiliated I will make you know the consequences of provoking an ancient god go die you lowly creature y Wu remained calm and replied can you not immediately call someone a lowly creature y Wu with a cold and menacing face coldly explained inferior beings humans and gods are fundamentally no different as long as one possesses strength beyond the bounds of imagination an inferior being can become a God now let me help someone as exalted as you recall what it feels like to be destroyed by the Lord of ruin the dark shimmering Aura and radiant Flames envelop y woo creating an overwhelming sense of pressure below everyone couldn't help but murmur look over there the star in the sky has vanished it's true even the Milky Way usually clearly visible at night seemed to have been swallowed by something what on Earth is happening you people still standing there concerned run quickly Yi Wu launched a powerful strike down at the ancient god the self-proclaimed deity could hardly believe what was happening he screamed impossible this power cannot be mistaken it's it it's definitely it how can a mere human like you possess this power it does not belong to this world the ancient god frantically thrashed about in the strange power that was binding him no my power is being drained devoured let me go wui below was continuously twitching while Tian Ken was bewildered not understanding why I didn't expect it to still exist stronger than the ancient god it's about to be engulfed by the darkness wui quickly regain your Consciousness wui ye woo glance coldly the dark flame can devour all things your natural power is no exception just let it become the nourishment to cultivate the darkness suddenly three streaks of light shot through she yelled absolutely cannot let you Devour the power of the ancient god in astonishment yiwu was still able to easily block it she was full of vigor her blood red protective Aura surrounding her body but she only chose to strike at this moment don't talk about being careful or foolish it's already too late Yi Wu glanced smirking this is mine she was left speechless then frantically scratched in a frenzy damn it I absolutely cannot let you take the power of the ancient God alone but y w easily blocked her even mocking her back if you have the ability go fight the ancient god early now wanting to benefit but lacking the skill is not even worthy of being a fisherman she remains stubborn I am one of the 28 stars in your eyes do I not even have the right to be a fisherman she was so angry that her face scrunched up damn it I once considered K city as something in my pocket raising a large army just for the day I could take it but I never expected it to hide an ancient god unexpectedly this was supposed to be the best opportunity for me to achieve Merit and Ascend to the throne so I disrupted the ruls for troop deployment squaring to obtain the ancient god but then I encountered a freak like this if I don't retrieve the power of the ancient god this time I'm as good as dead from her High position she commanded if we can't achieve a quick Victory then kill everyone in the city for me I want to see how you can oppose an entire Army by yourself they responded eagerly to the order all right my large ax and my belly have long been hungry their eyes radiated death ye W gloy asked how how do you know I'm alone the two armies of monsters faced off against each other and I shouted loudly Don't Be Afraid creatures summoned through magic won't last long as soon as his Mana is exhausted they'll naturally disappear charge at them and then the battle broke out from using weapons to engaging in numbers G A in terms of strength her troops were still being pushed back ahuh didn't you say it wouldn't last long we are completely overwhelmed y woo intentionally provoked your advantage in numbers doesn't seem to manifest at all hearing your subordinates roar I feel like a chicken being slaughtered stop being so complacent why don't you dare to face me directly and instead hide behind a clone what kind of man are you you retorted can't you see I'm busy defeat my senior first and then talk he looked at the two of them struggling for survival against each other and smiled lightly haha to be able to push things to this extent this guy isn't bad what a wonderful play but I have a feeling that next you might find yourself in a tough battle the group standing nearby leisurely chatted about the fight it's truly astonishing although the ancient god is not in complete form he can exert comprehensive suppression what kind of power has he actually used it's a relatively special type of energy unlike dark attribute magic but completely transcending the realm of this attribute I'm very interested in this guy one person spoke up does he possess the power of another ancient god it doesn't align with our current research on ancient gods this kind of power is far more profound suddenly someone suggested taking advantage of the moment while his Avatar is fighting the Demon Beast shouldn't we take action against his true body I'm afraid that later he will fully absorb the ancient god the other person waved it off no rush even if he absorbs everything it doesn't matter the ancient God will eventually reappear in the form of summoned Magic crystals that guy continuously uses big moves I'm sure he will fall into a state of anger and exhaustion at that time when he gets carried away it will be the best opportunity for us to strike the ancient god groaned gror star Shadow is star Shadow I can't believe you are not only still alive but have also obtained the body of this world Yu replied indifferently do you have anything else to say given that you're about to belong to me I might as well listen the ancient god laughed loudly haha indeed I have lost without Injustice but you a mere human not only have become its vessel but also want to possess the power of the ancient god this will definitely bring bad luck and destruction your death is not far away y Wu calmly responded such curses are truly soft and Powerless you best call the other ancient gods here otherwise wait for me to pretend to be cute your Master's words won't have any effect the ancient god only had time to say you all then the ancient god vanished YW said to the system it's time let's go the system replied congratulations host for defeating the ancient god you have received 88 m880 th000 magic crystals for summoning to summon a new God which allows you to summon the ancient god quii to fight for you you have obtained two ancient gods triggering a special mechanism and the ancient anent God has been placed into a special account system you can use experience points to enhance the power of the ancient god account the method of use still goes through magic crystals for summoning yiu was delighted this time on one step closer to the ultimate K account but suddenly cracks began to appear Yu was stunned and wondered M are these cracks caused by the previous Force breakthrough of the illusional the system answered that's right to repair you need to use a large amount of experience or money ye woo further inquired it's okay to be able to repair but please explain how much this large amount really is however the system announced though I would very much like to explain time for enhancement has run out the Shadow King account fell into a state of overload and was about to be forcibly used yiu unexpectedly fell from above what you would tried to ask more why is force suspension being implemented I haven't finished my battle yet I have enough money on me right now to burn right why didn't you say anything earlier the system coldly announced the final explanation rights belong to the account the signer does not need to Harbor resentment Yu barely smiled ah I've momentarily become afraid a clone as powerful as this it's over my life is really in danger in front of him Sun you level 190 Health remaining at 5% power at 0% suddenly yiu felt that he had no strength left in his body he could no longer withstand the opponent's attacks in a moment of confusion he suddenly realized something and wondered is this the Clone has disappeared seeing Yu exhausted she smiled smugly not only have you used all your skills but you've also fallen into a weakened State truly Heaven is helping me she laughed maniacally Haha I've bet on a win now is the time to take your small life and the power of the ancient god haha the crowd charged in unison she shouted loudly the time has come move out lying motionless on the ground yiu sighed telling himself ah walking by the river How Could my feet not get wet I never expected I would have a day where I'd be slapped in the face like this he looked back at the curse left by the ancient god and bitterly smiled those two curses came true so quickly abnormal State shattered Soul all attributes decreased by 80% system notification maintain 2 hours sudden you rushed down along with several sharp spikes shouting loudly you are definitely dead man you are surrounded by her spikes extremely dangerous ywu shouted loudly to IZ activate emergency Pandora armor IIs quickly responded understood but Master the Demonic Vortex technique seeing him struggling to create a shield sunu said in this extremely weakened State even if you can avoid a fatal blow you won't be able to withstand the next attack y wo hearing this anxiously said what am I really going to die here today suddenly a person rushed in with a sword calling out hey hey he stepped forward and cut through all the spikes surrounding Him Softly saying being a boss among the 28 star beasts taking advantage of someone in danger after dealing with it he put the sword back in place smirking and saying I thought demon Beasts of the boss level like you would talk about Marshall virtue you looked at him and asked may I ask who you are before he could finish he turned his head and said just a Wandering Swordsmen passing by son you annoyed by the interruption was ready to launch a new attack against him I shouted from the air you bastard how dare you ruin my good deed no matter if you are level 25 or level 250 the enormous Shield slammed straight towards the wandering Swordsmen she screamed everyone die the power of this ancient god belongs to me now the wandering swordsman calmly drove his sword sighed life is rushed why must we kill each other as soon as he finished speaking he effortlessly sliced the gigantic shield into pieces with one hand he softly said sitting down and enjoying fine wine is much better isn't it the sword strikes simultaneously pierced through her body he tilted his head slightly murmuring ah did that cut her body in two she screamed in pain what nonsense are you talking about what wine at this moment she realized she had been dealt a fatal blow before collapsing she stuttered a few final words what happened why am I her body split in two blood gushing out but wandering swordsman unhurriedly took out a wine bottle and drank it in large gulps he sighed murmuring even the taste of fine wine has never been tasted yet one hastily dies truly tragic you who stood by witnessing the power of the swordsman and couldn't help but be astonished he lowered his head and said thank you senior for your assistance he smiled and replied you inflicted injury on her I merely reaped the benefits no need to thank me you should leave first before saying anything upon hearing the wandering swordsman he asked in confusion bend down however he still obediently followed and bent down those who did not bend down were severely injured and fell backward after everything settled the wandering swordsman raised his voice and asked you've watched the play enough why haven't you revealed yourself yet you looked at his back and thought although this person's gestures and words are hard to decipher his level is undoubtedly above level 200 and his sword skills are perhaps even stronger than those of the sword Saint gin a man descended from the sky and said forgive me for my rudess as soon as he landed he drew his sword and struck at the wandering swordsman but he managed to block it in time the two of them quickly distanced themselves from each other the man then said I didn't expect to encounter you here Sho Chen Sho Chen continued the renowned captain of the Phoenix Cola team ranked fifth in the Eastern region why shuen has come all the way to this remote Southwest what are you pling he stood before for his subordinates smiling as he said of course I have a mission at hand y Wu was astonished after seeing this scene thinking do himself why are so many unfamiliar faces suddenly gathered here this situation is beyond expectations the person named shio Chen I still do not know what his purpose is for saving me but way shuen is definitely here targeting the ancient god no wonder they are from Shu win even the captain of the fifth battle team has reached level 190 compared to that our self Western safe Zone really is lagging far behind over here both of them were still talking Shu went furrowed his brows and asked are you planning to protect this young man XO Chen chuckled lightly replying I'm not really planning to protect but I am not accustomed to Shameless behavior taking advantage of someone's danger to bully them with numbers hearing this Shu W's face darkened he ordered I understand withdraw the team the subordinates were surprised by the order with one person loudly protesting but what about our mission one of the subordinates shouted Captain our Target is right in front of us why shouldn't we give up like this who is this man that even you must avoid why shuen quickly spoke up his voice calm but full of warning just remember one thing before that man named XA Ching gets serious shuen immediately hardened his expression his cold gaze sweeping over the crowd then he shouted loudly run that is a character we absolutely cannot provoke at this stage XO Chan sat back in his chair one hand propping up his chin his eyes casually following the scene he smiled faintly his voice tinged with a hint of mockery is that all it takes why shuen has gone through so much just to meet me and he won't even stay for a drink and a chat y wo standing beside him put his hands in his pockets and glanced at XA Chen he Shrugged his tones somewhat appreciative can I thank you now uncle if it weren't for your intervention I really would have died here today sha Chen turned to look at Yu his gaze indifferent he smirked slightly and replied being overly modest is just pretending put on a show kid I saw all your moves earlier this technique here that strike there you completely overpowered the ancient god with no resistance Yu looked slightly apprehensive and replied in a lower voice your joke joking Sho chin maintained his jovial demeanor clapping his hands on the armrest of his chair saying but when you've used up all your best moves in the end you will become weaker you need to think about the consequences before using your skills otherwise you will be taken advantage of you won't always be lucky enough to encounter someone like me who enjoys watching the excitement upon hearing this Yu's eyes lit up with excitement he nodded responding gratefully you are absolutely right uncle I will definitely pay attention from now on I really owe you a big favor this time if you have any requests just say it and I will do my utmost to satisfy you XA Chen placed his hand on yiwu's shoulder and laughed loudly so small yet already has such skill and Charisma not simple at all really not simple then I shall respectfully obey your command suddenly his face darkened he lowered his head slightly and continued then hand over the ancient god you just obtained to me hearing this Yi Wu immediately understood XO Chan's intentions xia Chen chuckled softly and said what's wrong hesitating now didn't you say you could satisfy any of my conditions so now you're in a difficult position I hate people who don't keep their word Yu sighed and replied are you really not trying to test me on purpose you know how hard I've worked to obtain this ancient god yet you intentionally chose it Sho chin responded confidently I'm generally a person with low desires but that was your own statement so ultimately will you hand it over you who looked up at xao Chan his gays Resolute this thing really cannot be given for certain reasons the ancient god is bound to my soul if you really want to take it then you'll have to kill me after all I no longer have the strength to resist but if your true purpose is indeed the ancient god then you wouldn't have needed to save me in the first place you are powerful like this and everything is under your control surely you have another Aim so please don't challenge my Humanity anymore all right hearing this Sho Chan laughed loudly and said haha it seems my acting skills are still lacking I got exposed by you yigu then asked so who exactly are you why did you save me XO Chan drank the remaining wine in his bottle and replied hey what bad intentions could I have I'm really just a drifter in K City singing and drinking every day looking at the EMP bottle regretfully he said a battle that shook the heavens ruined my drinking spot and not a single drop is left it truly makes me melancholic Yu chuckled and said you don't need to worry about that if you don't mind I can invite you to the safe Zone there's fine wine from Zone one to zone 9 you can choose whatever you like upon hearing this Sha Chan friendly put his arm around Yu's shoulders and laughed really getting to know you I feel it was worth it to save you you haha he continued you really are something a stakeholder of hanmo yiu was slightly surprised and asked back you claim you have no bad intentions you know my identity so well xoan scratched his head and laughed awkwardly oh I let it slip that's so awkward haha if that's the case I won't hide anymore he suddenly became s and said seriously my true purpose is the map drawn by mu way himself which is currently in your possession seeing the danger radiating from Xiao Chan y Wu understood This Time It's For Real even though this map is very valuable at this stage it is not worth more than my life he sighed and asked awkwardly how did you know I have Mo Way's map have you ever been to the safe Zone to meet my principal upon hearing this Sho chin laughed with Glee of course we had a good time drinking and chatting together y Wu furrowed his brow suspiciously asking further was it really just drinking and chatting you didn't do anything to him did you the atmosphere suddenly froze realizing ye wo's misunderstanding XA Chan immediately spoke up hey what's with that expression it was just drinking and chatting what else could I do your principal is an old friend of mine what could I possibly do to him at this moment I viz interjected calmly Master this guy isn't lying y woo helplessly thought this guy even either doesn't know how to act or acts way too well either way he is truly unpredictable after a while yiu reluctantly took out a document from his bag handed it to XA Chen and said I didn't expect our principal not only to be friends with the current Mo way but also to know someone as formidable as you truly a natural socialite in that case please take it sh Chen receive it smiled and said thank you sha Chen eagerly opened the document his eyes full of anticipation as he flipped it open he murmured let's see but when the document was opened all he saw was a blank white page he was taken aback and exclaimed what is this his expression changed and shell Chen seriously pondered is this a special spell cast on the star map I didn't expect him to be this cautious quite impressive elsewhere the old man mu way smiled mysteriously as if he had anticipated this all along xio Chan slowly closed the document and handed it back to Yu sighing I've finished reading here you go Yu quickly grabbed it his eyes sparkling with delight he asked oh is that it I thought you wanted to keep it shoen chuckled lightly and replied I never said I wanted to keep it in any case my goal has been achieved now we just need some wine when will suddenly a loud call interrupted why woo it was Kai xay she rushed over and hugged Yu without hesitation her voice filled with concern ywo I was so worried about you yiwu gently patted her shoulder and said softly don't worry I'm fine no one can harm you anymore from nearby shoi laughed harly I told you he did it yiu nodded his gaze filled with gratitude Zen Chang approached channeling energy to both ywu and Kai XA his voice was calm this time your weaken state is more serious than before but luckily my level has increased so it's not a big issue hearing this yiu gratefully said Thank You Ki standing beside them proudly patted guu shoulder his voice filled with joy I knew it you not only defeated wuji but also tamed the ancient god well done the girls outside also admired and cheered you are amazing Ki continued but right now K city has turned into this state and we have lost our place to stay what should we do about this seeing the dire situation that were moved to tears that's right what are we going to do in the future s he helplessly replied can you not imply it so clearly the things I promised you I will naturally be able to do after that yiu pointed to a spatial hole and said I will rebuild K City into a small safe Zone before that everyone should go inside this dungeon first I have a base in here she asked in surprise you have have a private dungeon I can't believe it suddenly he turned to the two girls and instructed Nana sister Annie you all go in first my sister and father mother are inside once things stabilize we will go together to find senior and Chen they agreed okay we will follow your Arrangements nanam deide her also replied okay sister yanf will definitely be surprised by your changes before leaving Ki turned to Yu reluctantly saying then I accept your good intentions after all there are many girls like this that need care so please make sure to take responsibility until the very last moment sh G smiled mischievously kid you said you didn't want a herum isn't it already full this time I VI teased indeed looking far ahead the king of the Haram the king of the Haram drives you helpless then he instructed his teammates you guys should go in there will be one last battle later and this opponent is stronger than wui it's better for you to stay hidden for the time being one person in the group responded apologetically I'm sorry I can't be of any help to you I have to let you fight alone yiu smiled reassuringly it's okay you have already helped me a lot kakai stood at the entrance of the space waving his hand and saying woo be careful I'm waiting for you he nodded um the space door snapped shut Sho chin crossed his arms and asked sir seriously I didn't expect you to hide someone like that but if you die and I mean just if what will happen to them Yu replied if that's the case I will destroy the dungeon key before I die so they can safely live in there completely separated from this chaotic World Sho Chen chuckled leisurely it's a good idea but in this chaotic world right now there probably isn't any place that is truly peaceful anymore so it's best if you don't die what's even more important is that you still me a round of drinks remember to let me choose the dishes y woo chuckled softly saying haha of course I was just thinking about finally dying but at least I hope I can choose the way I die taking my destiny into my own hands Yu's words surprised the other person he burst into laughter haha who would have thought a kid like you so small could understand life better than many people so when are we going to grab a drink or do we have to wait for you to finish fighting someone first in the Stillness of the night the response from the other person rang out that's right but before the fight there is something important that needs to be dealt with on the other side T Kon was straining to carry muui he spoke hurriedly muu we have to leave here quickly otherwise waiting for ywu to come will be very Troublesome CH K continued his voice filled with determination even if the consciousness of the person has been taken away becoming a vegetable I will not give up we must definitely continue to live suddenly Yi Wu appeared upon seeing the scene his face briefly displayed a look of surprise then broke into a cold smile standing opposite y Wu felt irritated and asked what's this you want to leave without a word of greeting Ty Keon suddenly shouted loudly Li woo his voice trembled mixed with pleading please spare us wuji's Consciousness has disappeared and now he is just a shell completely unable to threaten you I beg you to let us go seeing Wu Jay lying motionless I thought to myself indeed just an empty shell I can't sense any Soul fluctuations he must have never thought he would end up like this right wui you said he betray and abandoned you but still accepted him to reach this stage didn't you CH K stubbornly said I don't care I don't care what he ultimately did I only know that in the beginning it was he who led me out of hell gave me a second life so I will repay him this second life even though it makes no sense at all I have to do it y Wu cast a spell coldly laughed and said you think I will let you go so easily Ty Kiran panicked pleading urgently no please if you want to kill me then kill me at least spare Lord wui in this state suddenly Yu lifted a nearby car coldly saying kill no death for you is just the simplest punishment in your current state surviving in this world would be more painful than death itself and this suffering is what you deserve to endure therefore I will not kill you upon hearing this T cam was overjoyed and quickly replied thank you thank you for not killing us Yu looked at him and said I don't need any repayment from you this is the key to the collection accumulated over many years by wuji take it then y wo threw the key towards tanan he grabbed the keys turned his back leaving behind just one one sentence get lost in front of me while I haven't changed my mind yet he obediently replied yes yes watching him drive away with wuji XO Chan thought to himself no matter how unpleasant this person speaks the fact remains that sparing their life is true should I say he has a soft heart or is merciless Yu spoke up let's go Uncle there's only one more thing left after that we can go have a drink he nodded and replied all right but can you handle the next thing I sense a huge energy approaching yiu turned and calmly replied probably not suddenly the system announced a high energy source has been detected ahead activating danger warning mechanism forcibly entering spatial system y Wu confused asked danger warning what exactly is happening the systems voice resonated steady due to continuous combat earlier the main account has been overused and fallen into a state of fatigue the strength of the Chen Emperor and twin witch has decreased by 50% the Shadow King and ancient god accounts are in a sealed state with an expected recovery time of 4 hours hearing this he shouted in dissatisfaction what fatigue period I've never heard of such a setup we are about to fight Guang Jen and the main combat account can't be used isn't this trying to kill me a asked beside Master don't you still have the magic Crystal to summon the bugs in the Army can't you call them out for support in battle he replied when facing a level 240 Master like Wang Jen numbers don't matter besides we can't even determine yet whether Wong Jen is hiding his true strength the dragon also encouraged y woo call call he turned and said thank you for your concern but this time I can't let you take risks at this point I can only bet on unlocking a new account right the system spoke up again so you finally want to unlock a new account would you like to use a large Capital to guide your search or randomly choose a network to unlock hearing the tone they felt a bit helpless he said oh why does it feel like the systems tone is a bit excited I VI replied very suspicious but I don't have any evidence the system awkwardly responded how could that be it's just that the master hasn't withdrawn a card for a long time um then please choose a method to un un loock Yi Wu decisively said since the battles before have accumulated a large amount of unused experience system deduct 1 billion experience and unlock five random accounts a notification sounded unlocking new accounts the void beast king appeared I Vis introduce this is interesting a promising future The Entity devours small black holes it continues the functionality seems very powerful but the current maturity system cannot be used to cope with emergency situations next but one peeking into the dimensional planes emerged yiu said this account when used in conjunction with the void beast king is truly amazing but right now I need a combat enhanced account can you provide one suddenly a light burst forth and he exclaimed in Joy rainbow light could it be that the system is notifying the host of the opening of two completely new legendary accounts the female Marshall God pillar of descent code appeared he asked not only indiscriminate attack but also must transform into female isn't that absolutely not I viz replied that's right after all feminine attire only happens once and can occur countless times once you get used to it you can't escape it or even something else he angrily pinched its head and said thank you for explaining such strange knowledge if I am really forced to open a female account I will absolutely dissect you first it became dizzy swirling and apologizing I'm sorry Master under the brilliant Golden Light yiu looked at the system and said I can only place my hopes on this last account please let's hope this time it will be a strong and somewhat normal account the dazzling light suddenly disappeared and a character appeared before him it was the immortal Baldhead Emperor woo yiu gaped incredulously exclaiming no way spending a whole 1 billion experience points to open two legendary accounts and one turns out to be a crazy woman and the other a bald head what is going on I Vis His companion quickly comforted him Master don't be discouraged the side effect of this account is just a bit of baldness and Mild depression I'm sure it's still manageable Yu signed in defeat well a bald head is fine at least it's better than turning into a woman system switched to the immortal Baldhead Emperor woo account the system the immediately confirmed the special legendary account has been activated Yu could only accept and prepare to act with this new identity just then xen unexpectedly appeared asking in Surprise G wo how are you doing without waiting for a response an old man also appeared staring intently at Yi Wu and saying finally I found you yiu frowned and irritably replied why are you looking at me and calling me y wo read the name care carefully before making a move he angrily said even if you are not yo if you can withstand one of my punches it proves you are also a master wait for me to finish dealing with Y wo then I will find you the old man turned around and shouted loudly y woo where are you come out here Yu weakly replied aren't I right here both old men were surprised and asked you are y wo completely different from our imagination you're so young here those words of criticism Yu felt offended and said Hayes this is so annoying I'm too lazy to explain let's get to the point quickly and end this joke Guang jant laughed loudly I never expected truly did not expect the Youth of today have worked hard to this extent even I feel outdated shoen agreed that's right you have been hidden away for many years you probably don't know the pressures of this era are truly no joke we are like struggling before death in Yu's heart he had different thoughts he silently evaluated this kid has unexpectedly transformed his completely bald head must be due to a special ability indeed it's hard to see through he waved his hand his expression Sullen enough stop talking nonsense right now I have no interest in the things you are discussing let's fight and finish this journey quickly hang Jen shouted angrily follow the route are you looking down on me I came here struggling to fight you not just to follow the path I had high hopes for you and what is the result a negative State without any willpower at all y woo remained indifferent I'm sorry I'd only me to Target you but I have no interest in the world Guang Jin Furious charged straight at Yu fine then let me use my fists to treat you he threw a powerful punch at Yu followed by a kick that sent him flying back Yu had some minor bruises losing only 1% of his blood but his bald head remained shiny as ever Yu sneered is this your strength with this little power you want to hurt me it's not even enough to make me feel interested in fighting back Huang Jinn grew even angrier rushing in to throw a flurry of punches at guo's head kiddo let's see if you dare to look down on me again each of his punches cracked the ground beneath them from a distance xia chin observed and commented even from this far away I can still feel a tremendous power of Wong Jen truly a reputation that precedes him but what about this Kido Yu he's getting punched repeatedly and isn't harmed at all his level of endurance surpasses human comprehension could this be the special ability of his bald head he looked at his empty wine bottle shaking his head in dismay such a great play yet there's no good wine in hand what a Pity truly a Pity after a moment Wang Jen stepped back beads of sweat on his face he angrily cursed damn it I've punched you until my hands are smoking yet you haven't moved an inch what kind of monster are you he sighed and lightly replied Hayes as you can see I'm just a bald guy Guang Jen's face darkened clenching his fists and grinding his teeth you're really impressive I used all my strength to hit you and only took away 5% of your health when it comes to physical strength there's likely no one in this world stronger than you so that's it you must have been like me back then because you couldn't find an opponent you've fallen into endless loneliness and succumb to this state is this what they call the Solitude of Champions hearing this he immediately pointed at his bald head and Str strongly denied no no no I fell into self-blame and heavy depression just because I lost my hair it has nothing to do with the Solitude of Champions or aging he was astonished staring wide-eyed and ask asking what you practice martial arts and let something as trivial as losing your hair destroy your spirit clearly you possess terrifying physical strength why is your inner self weaker than glass y Wu pointed at Huang Jen his voice full of contempt how could someone with thick hair like you understand the pain of a bald person what makes me depressed is not the external flaw but the regret of having neglected to cultivate my hair YW words left Wang Jen speechless unable to retort fine if you no longer care then let me use my strongest form to erase you from this world with that Wang xen transformed into his battle form his body was clad in thick armor exuding a terrifying power sha Chen was stunned hey hey has Wang Jen only been using the basic state to fight until now now that he's dawned his armor and Equipment his power has surged like this can ye woo withstand it if things take a turn for the worse should I intervene with a raging momentum hang xen charged toward guu this armor has been around for decades and today is the first time I get to wear it the second round began Wang Jen delivered a powerful punch to Yu causing him to spit blood the pain felt like a volcano erupting behind y Wu the space looked like a glass pain cracking Shia Chan shouted in horror a rift in space ju Jen's punch is powerful enough to create a crack in space his hands could they be wide area Divine great weapons without stopping Wang Jen continued to punch yo sending him flying through the rift in space it's not over yet I'm giving you a trip to the paradise of space he fell into a strange space where is this I was struck by a punch into the crack of space his body ache causing him to exclaim so this is a parallel world it hurts so much my body feels like it's being tortured as as soon as he hit the ground The Familiar voice of the old man eoe again are you still alive my skills can create a random parallel space but if you want to force your way in you will be erased by some special Laws of Power the old man clenched his fist his eyes gleaming with excitement I originally intended to use this mechanism to kill you but your body's toughness managed to withstand that force and you even survived this is the first time I have seen someone like you it really excites me ywo stood up abruptly blood still at 80% it hurts so much he darkened his face muttering how long has it been how long has it been since I felt this pain this pain surpasses even psychological wounds making me temporarily forget my suffering in an instant he emitted a mysterious dark Aura come on keep going let me feel a little more pain the old man noticing Yu's strange demeanor could not help but ask what nonsense are you talking about yiwu's eyes Shone brightly his expression serious without a hint of Gest you will die hang Jin from a distance gathered all his energy finally the old man decided to take action now let's see just how strong your abilities have reached aside from your outstanding physical toughness as soon as he finished speaking he threw a punch that set the Old Man flying into the air blood spurted out as the man swayed in midair Yi wo glided up close closing in on him from above a storm of punches rained down in the sky on the ground X Chen felt a wave of terrifying pressure this kid y Wu is planning to beat kuang Jen to death in midair shaen thought to himself with his superhuman body strength combined with Incredible speed and power yiu seemed to belong to a different world than them he toyed with the old man as if he were a play thing and sneered why you think you can hurt me with this level of skill use all your strength if not I really will kill you Upon finishing his words y Wu threw Huang Jan hard to the ground the Earth shattered and dust filled the air despite being covered in injuries hang Jen stood up from the ruins with an overwhelming Laura he growled it's been so many years since I've felt the fear brought by such a disparity in strength but that's what makes it interesting yo I owe you my gratitude thanks to you I now have the opportunity to face the fear of death once again and because of you I will grow stronger Yu looked at him coldly what does becoming stronger even mean it holds no value for me it may not mean anything to you but for me power is everything Wang Jen roared in an instant he had completely recovered his body reaching its peak State his eyes Shone with intensity I'd never drunk blood in a battle but today I will make an exception for you now let's fight to our hearts content the two two sides had no idea how many rounds they had fought everything they swept across was shattered both of them struck their opponents at the same time XO chin felt a bit worried even though yiu still had an absolute Advantage hang Jen was gradually catching up to Y Wu speed even in the face of being overwhelmed Wang Jen continued to grow it seemed like he had no limits is this still a human no way rather than saying Wong Jen was growing it would be more accurate to say that Yu's state was changing hang Jen also noticed something unusual he asked what's wrong with you why are your speed and strength weakening you're still so young and yet your endurance is worse than this old man haha Yu did not respond but in his mind warning signals kept ringing warning warning in ye Wu subconscious the account Immortal Baldhead Emperor woo seemed to be choking him the side effects of the power from this account were deepening over time continued use of this account could corrode the owner's Consciousness should it be disconnected Yi Wu was an utter confusion how can this be is this the risk of using such a powerful account the feeling of Suffocation grew clearer by the moment he knew that if he left his current state now Wang Jen would immediately kill him I can't switch back I must hold on a bit longer I will use my ultimate skill to decide Victory or defeat outside he continuously swung his fist at me with a joyful expression he said indeed all those years of sealing have not been in vain finally getting to enjoy a good beating right after coming out these hands have been restrained for so long now they can finally be satisfied with the final blow he struck me down to the ground using both hands laughing heartily he continued so how is it the pain you anticipated is what I brought to you has your depression been cured yet my blood had dropped to 60% but with then my fighting Spirit burned fiercely my mouth kept mumbling he not enough absolutely not enough then I let out a faint smile I have completely lost any interest hearing this he roared in Anger what you dare looked down on me without saying more he immediately charged downward don't underestimate my will this isn't over yet before his words could conclude a colossal fist rushed straight toward him taken by surprise and unable to react he took the punch directly the Collision caused such a massive explosion that even Cho Chen standing at a distance felt the shock wave he exclaimed incredible this guy's final move is truly too powerful as the explosion subsided Guang Jen lay in a deep pit his body mangled he coughed a few times and then weakly laughed indeed I still can't defeat you but dying at the hands of a strongman like you I have no regrets come on finish it give me one last blow seeing y wo Still Standing motionless the old man felt a bit angry and shouted what's wrong why aren't you making a move do you pity me or something he had no idea that deep inside gwu's subconscious he was in immense pain he thought to himself it's over my body has been completely corroded I can't move anymore even my Consciousness is about to fade away the system continuously sounded alarms warning warning the host body has been corroded 95% control over the system has been lost Huang Jen struggled to stand up filled with bitterness he told himself if I'm not as skilled as others I must admit defeat but to tell me to die without fighting to the end is unacceptable I don't leave anyone's pity looking at Yu the old man gritted his teeth and said do you dare to underestimate me if so I have no choice but to fight to the death Guang Jen decided to activate his final skill he shouted magic Crystal frenzy transformation this skill would consume all of his levels and cultivation to exchange for power beyond his limits in an instant his body transformed into a gigantic monster with all his strength he launched a tremendous punch aimed straight at yiu received my final blow ywo this punch would not only affect y wo but also the account parasitized ing his body the account Immortal Baldhead Emperor woo suffered severe damage yet it continued to recover as usual in the moment of his remaining Consciousness Yi Wu regained control over the system he immediately ordered sever the account link now juang Jen had just restored his original appearance when he collapsed to the ground unconscious and breathless the old man was emaciated trembling uncontrollably yet still smiled his level had dropped to only 40 k GRS seeing both sides suffering sha Chen side is the final outcome that both are injured Hayes living is the most important thing fortunately I'm not the type of person who likes to take risks at that moment he noticed the Convoy that had just arrived looking at the Insignia on the vehicle XO Chen muttered why has it taken so long ah right this Insignia is from Wang xang group's accomplices a group of people stepped out of the vehicle led by Ling you on she spoke bluntly without beating around the bush don't block my way old man our only target is y wo you don't need to risk your life to protect him just name your price that proposal made XO Chen respond proudly you want to buy me off with money my price has always been very steep can you afford it Lan Yan only laughed upon hearing this although W Jen group is no more I have long since sees power my personal assets have not been been significantly affected just name your price whether it's 1 billion or whatever I can pay it he looked at y wool lying unconscious and couldn't help but wonder is his life really worth that much money or does she have a deep-seated grudge against him to spend money like this Ling Yuan nodded her voice cold if it weren't for him causing trouble I wouldn't have fallen into this predicament if I don't kill him I won't be able to find peace Lan yuan's loyal subordinates immediately replied boss he's just a second rate trash why discuss money with him just kill him and it's done that's right I hate those who lack ability yet pretend otherwise indeed they won't shed tears until they see the coffin at that moment XA chin appeared he used his skill to split the building behind the group leaving everyone in shock I advise you to give up on the idea of robbing let me think it over first and then we can continue he said calmly then paused for a moment his cold eyes sweeping over everyone of course if you really want to make a move I am also more than willing to play along the group of subordinates suddenly terrified hurriedly apologized we we were Reckless please reconsider however while Cho chin pretended not to notice one of the individuals nearby leaned in and whispered to Ling Yuan this person is unfathomable it's best not to have a direct conflict with him Ling you want to agreed money seemed to have some effect on Xiao Chen as he didn't immediately refuse but she smiled coldly her eyes flashing with determination the price I offer no one can refuse though the two were discussing matters XA Chen interjected recently I really have been a bit cash trapped if I had this sum of money fine wine and beautiful women would no longer be a concern he smiled confidently and concluded 1 billion is the deal you can take it the subord were astonished Whispering among themselves is he really asking for 1 billion Ling Yuan pondered for a moment this time the Manpower used to locate Guang Jen has cost a lot 1 billion is indeed quite expensive but to eliminate the greatest threat this amount must still be spent after careful consideration she nodded I keep my promises if it's 1 billion then it's 1 billion upon receiving the money sha Chin's attitude changed immediately he smiled ingratiatingly thank you boss you are indeed generous everything went smoothly Ling you w ordered go and capture the target immediately but just as she turned around xaan blocked her with his sword he coldly said wait a moment she couldn't help but ask what do you mean you take my money and now you want a backtrack sha Chen shook his head pointed his sword in another Direction and said do you misunderstand something I'm not saying for you to take Yu I want you to take hang Jen isn't he the founder of your Wang Jen Group 1 billion is already a discounted price for you being deceived like this made him Furious what this old skeleton it's Guang Jen I didn't recognize him at all just now how did he end up like this we thought he had beaten the wo and then left who would have thought the leader was him Lan Yan calmed down a bit approached to observe the corpse and remarked even you lost to Yi Wu the current situation of Wong Jen group is also due to your neglect you have no value left now so whether you live or die I don't want to care his teeth clenched as he recalled the dark memories of years past moreover he accidentally abandoned my mother and me when I was just a newborn in the end that caused my mother to work herself to illness and leave this world early when my mother and I were suffering where were you if it weren't for wanting to kill you woo how could I have gone through the trouble of begging a person like you the revelation of his identity made y wo who was unconscious exclaim hang Jen is your father this is truly surprising although he abandoned his family and children and is not a good person using him and then discarding him is cruel enough langing yuang shouted what do people like you with parents know do you know how much effort I put in to climb to this position how much torment I endured yet everything I paid staking obtained was destroyed overnight it's all because of you y woo unable to hold back any longer she grabbed her sword and charged forward Li Woo You Must Die I will definitely kill you the wave of hatred clouding her reason made Cho Chen only shake his head who said that the main character must lose all their parents unfortunately this girl has chosen the wrong path and cannot turn back anymore he thought to himself suddenly Yin buan appeared from nowhere stabbing her right in the chest and saying you should die instead witnessing the one he loved being ambushed he furiously rushed forward dared to touch Ling Yuan I will kill you however before he could attack he was knocked Away by the opponent's sword G Wang cheu and stepped out from the Mist coldly advising Stand Down Ling Yuan cannot be saved anymore give it up I can spare your life he questioned G Wang Chuan why are you here how could your level increase so rapidly in such a short time onean how replied disdainfully Although our levels have increased thanks to special training is this really the time for you to care about that mocking laughter came from leya honestly I don't want to remember those days of special training it was too terrifying like Singh responded thoughtfully if I don't go to hell who will but compared to the hellish training of the captain I find hell itself more bearable nearby danl couldn't take it anymore and spoke up hey why are you all so chatty is this really the time to be saying these things you've completely ruined the atmosphere meeting these people B Ling you w spit blood she said Mong team why are you here the next powerful figure to appear maver cough up even more blood she struggled to look at that person and asked M you also appeared in this desolate Place M replied with a faint smile is it strange Yu is a major shareholder of hand group protecting his life is also the dubie of the Mong team after Wang Jen was annihilated Ling Yuan could have walked away but instead she chose the path of revenge against Yi Wu from the moment she made that choice she stepped onto a deadend road youa provoked someone you shouldn't have before dying people often say a few final words and Ling Yuan was no exception she smiled her voice full of defiance how ridiculous I leing you on have never regretted my decision the only thing I regret is being too weak lacking the talent of others If Heaven is willing to give me a chance I would still choose Revenge I must make YW die before her words finished Yin Juan's sword had pierced through her body Yin hoan coldly said you no longer have a chance one person in the group shouted Ling yuan's name upon seeing his teammate perish he couldn't help but feel heartbroken preparing to rush forward for Revenge but ji Wang cheu and blocked him his voice Stern stay still don't move there's no need to lose your life for this Wicked Woman you only have a normal Master servant relationship with her she's dead now and this relationship is over he was heartbroken to the point of ignoring the words spoken grasping the sword and rushing towards Yin Hanan with the intention of killing her accompanied by the shout do you really think that our relationship is just a normal Master servant one I will do anything for her even if she is a wicked woman I will never abandon her jiwang Chuan was taken aback his gaze complex as he looked at his opponent it seems that even someone as strong as I am has things that are Beyond understanding soon after his life came to an end on the edge of the sword ultimately the remnants of battle were obliterated however in G Wang chuan's heart there lingered something as his eyes turned towards Yin Juan why does she make me unable to comprehend meanwhile Yin Ruan gently asked her voice warm yet tinged with worry V wo are you okay Yi Wu smiled wearily but his eyes were full of appreciation with both of you by my side I've been favored by the girls like this I must have worked hard well let's go home he leaned against her shoulder and nodded slightly yes letun go home suddenly the glaring sunlight Shone in causing yiu to awaken his head throbbed and memories flooded back he recalled clearly CLE that he had suddenly lost Consciousness now yiu realized he was in the first safe Zone the headquarters of the Han Wu Corporation he murmured softly so I have returned to a safe place but where is Yin huan could it be that she has been by my side caring for me all this time I wonder how long I have been asleep his body screamed in exhaustion the battles fought recently although Victorious came at a steep price he knew that from now on he could no longer continue to fight alone like this y Wu gently got out of bed and covered ginban with a blanket but she suddenly woke up seeing the person in front of her was healthy again she couldn't help but be surprised Vango you're awake quickly lie down you were so weak before you need to rest well he shook his head smiling in refusal actually I've rested enough already there's no need to worry hearing this Yin huan scolded how can you say that just before you suddenly fainted while walking and then slept for 3 days do you know how worried I and the young lady were she sighed softly her gaze heavy with self- Plame if I had gone with you to the Wilderness earlier it would have been better even if my strength is not as good as yours at least I could have shared some of the pressure with you but compared to my indecisiveness the young lady immediately mobilized all the main forces of the corporation as soon as she heard the news to provide assistance to you in the wilderness she paused her voice growing softer compared to the young lady's bravery I really yuu interrupted this is entirely my own doing it has nothing to do with you don't blame yourself anymore although the process had many difficulties the outcome was still good at least I returned safely don't worry hearing him say that Yin mu felt somewhat relieved um seeing you recovered I'm reassured now the morning sunlight streamed through the window capturing yiwu's gaze he saw it's been a long time since I've been able to enjoy this peaceful sunlight suddenly recalling something he turned to ask by the way do you know where the uncle who used to be with me is now she asked again that person he disappeared after returning to the safe Zone with us Yin Ruan continued but there has been feedback that a famous man has appeared in a high-end nightclub in zone one it must be him in the nightclub XO Chan laughed happily the liquor of the safe zone is really good and the Beauties are even more beautiful hearing that Yu couldn't help but think where did this guy get so much money to spend with his style he must have swindled a considerable amount from L Yuan he suddenly asked what about old y the pharmacist from Wang Jang how is he doing now Yin moan replied we found him in Ling yuan's Convoy although he was seriously injured he insisted he was your spy in Hong Jang the young lady took him back for treatment so he should be fine Yu suddenly remembered something and asked you mean Guang Jen how is he now I remember he wasn't dead yet Yin vuan answered initially the young lady intended to leave him out in the wilderness but just before you fell into a coma you said something about wanting to save Wong Jen although it's unclear what you wanted to do the young lady still brought him back however his injuries were too severe despite using the most advanced treatment equipment and medicines we are unable to stop his life force from dwindling he probably won't last much longer after hearing this Yu said take me to see him when Yu arrived at the clinic he couldn't help but be startled and exclaimed does a dying person really need so many people to watch over him Yin huan followed behind and explained this is the wish of the young lady after all the person in question is the legendary hang Jen even if he only has one last breath left we should not take any chances I will wait for you outside I won't go in observing the man who was barely alive on the hospital bed ye woo mocked is this the result you pursued all your life Wong Jen perhaps it would have been better for you to die in the wild than to end up like this but because of that final strike you expended all your cultivation and instead saved me perhaps that is why I subconsciously want to save you with all due respect Yi Wu gently lifted Wong Jen's hand and said at the very least I will let you leave with dignity Huang Jen unexpectedly replied I abandoned my wife and children committed Evil all my life and never thought I would leave in dignity with the last bit of life he had he poured out his wishes to be able to fight to the death with a strong man like you is what I've pursued my whole life this is also the greatest favor that heaven has granted me with this battle I am content then he handed Yu a key and instructed take this it is the accumulation of my entire life although it is not wealth it is more useful than money you are still young and your future has boundless possibilities this will help you he observed the item in his hand and asked again are you sure you want to give this to me I am the one who killed your two sons destroying the fortune you built by yourself until now he had always been an honest man so when he received the question from him he could only laugh and reply these worldly Notions are nothing but Illusions to me whether coldblooded and different it matters not I am solely devoted to pursuing a life born out of my fight you have provided me with a wonderfully engaging battle had I not met you I might have lived my life in loneliness and regrets so before he could finish his sentence he had already left Yu also walked away with a series of thoughts although he is a wicked Man compared to devious and malicious Scoundrels at least he acts straightforwardly and remains steadfast in his goals thus he said his final words to Wang Jen I will remember you Wang Jen outside G Wang chuan's hospital room announced vwo there will be a colleague meeting for the corporation next so I came to inform you to attend he nodded all right Captain Yin Juan Wang Jen has died tell someone to handle the aftermath ji Wang Chun looked after his departing figure unable to contain his Envy not only did he defeat Wu but even Huang Jen at level 24 has also Fallen to him his rate of growth has far exceeded my expectations I initially thought that after going through this special training I could keep up with him but unexpectedly I have been left far behind he furrowed his brow wondering what he should do to catch up to him I've this spoke up warning Master behind you are chaotic emotions there is anger jealousy resentment as well as admiration and affection I don't understand what this person is thinking you who simply disregarded it and thought he is exactly such a person seemingly complex but in reality he is a very simple person just like kuang Jen after a period of movement he finally arrived at the meeting room before getting into the main topic Yi Wu stood up and offered an apology this incident in K city was originally my personal Grudge in the end I had used the power of the corporation for this I would like to express my apologies M immediately interjected what are you talking about iwu you are a shareholder of hanmo Corporation this Petty matter does not need to be taken to Heart the existence of wuj has long been a thorn in our side this time you have uprooted him this is a great achievement the corporation has yet to thank you enough molong quickly added wuja had previously obstructed our transactions with the major regions from now on this source of interference will vanish trade between the major regions will be smoother and it will bring great benefits to the development of the corporation this is all thanks to you Yi wo then he implemented his plan our handm Mo group will rebuild the second Southwest safe Zone at the old s of K City this will be a satellite zone of the Southwest safe Zone we will continue to leverage the geographical advantages of this area he slammed his hand on the table and pointed at Yu I fully entrust you with the management yiu was taken aback you're entrusting this to me Mo long nodded that's right the primary reason for convening today's council meeting is to announce this matter this is a significant initiative with historical breakthrough significance so I cannot decide it alone now everyone let's begin the vote after he finished speaking the other council members began to discuss one person spoke up indeed it has never been the case to expand territory beyond the safe zones until now everyone has thought that defending a territory to surv survive is the ultimate goal another added but if we successfully build the second safe Zone and restore trade it would indeed be very beneficial someone else interjected unable to hide their skepticism but after all yugu is still so young before he could finish his sins the council interrupted so what if he's young Heroes emerge from youth if it weren't for y wo we wouldn't even have this opportunity expanding territory just hearing that gets my blood boiling the gradually came to a conclusion with the unanimous vote of Moi N I raised both hands in agreement before you even had a chance to raise your own hands I had already raised both my hands and both my feet in approval the manager nodded in agreement very good the entire assembly has voted in favor receiving the trust from everyone made Yu feel a sense of achievement he stood up and spoke thank you for everyone's support expanding territory beyond the safe zone is a Monumental task this is not only about breaking with history but also demonstrating the foresight and ambition of our chairman if we have decided to take this step why not take an even bigger step Yi Wu outlined the detailed plan I propose to link the southwestern safe Zone and area 2 together we will use the watchtowers to delineate the boundaries over a broader range at the same time we will eliminate all beasts within this area and bring as many wild settlers in as possible providing them with a safe haven finally we we will transform the Wilderness between the two safe zones into an ultra-large area with a greater scop and scale he further emphasized if we proceed this way we can concentrate all the resources from both the Wilderness and the Southwest this will promote rapid development for the ultra safe Zone in the end this area could be on par with the large Eastern Zone the board of directors was stunned after hearing this one person exclaimed vwu are you serious Liah said seriously building a super safe Zone this is truly a large-scale project that has never been heard of before we had originally intended to use the old K city as a satellite for the safe Zone but yiwu's plan is to incorporate the entire Wilderness Area into the project Pang ha upon hearing this offered his opinion it cannot be denied that this plan is very daring but also very appealing however if we want to implement it the level of difficulty will undoubtedly be significant moim filled with doubts looked at him and asked if you are making such a bold hypothesis I have a few points of concern that I hope you can address he pondered for a moment before responding first of all let's put aside the construction of K City to establish the super saake Zone as you mentioned a large-scale renovation of the Wilderness Area must first be carried out among these the most crucial aspect is to build a transportation system and absolutely safe information stations between the two City areas first is the issue of transporting goods secondly insuring communication networks and aerial systems are in place additionally Arrangements must be made for the residents of the Wilderness and to clear out the beasts in this area considering the vast size of the Wilderness a preliminary estimate of the maintenance cost would have to reach a staggering figure of around 18 million yeu listen quietly his gaze unwavering on the screen the number 800 billion immediately appeared everyone was startled and exclaimed 800 billion the Southwest safe Zone has taken hundreds of years to build and it doesn't even reach 200 billion another shareholder said this is an astronomical figure even if Han Mo goes bankrupt we cannot achieve this m naai explained calmly this is only the expenditure in terms of costs the most difficult challenge is dealing with the monsters and the wild dungeon even if we exhaust all our efforts to eliminate all the monsters in the area we will still face even greater challenges how can we deal with the newly emerging monsters from the SpaceTime Rifts the areas of fog that appear randomly are also a serious problem he paused for a moment and then continued the super safe Zone I just mentioned is not only vast but also increases the difficulty of the plan however this is not all we need to discuss the issue of our relationship with the large area to the east currently we maintain a neutral relationship with them occasionally there are bus business collaborations but overall we are still at a disadvantage because the opponent's strength is much greater than ours m n pondered once we begin constructing the super safe Zone we will certainly attract their attention a clash between the large areas will then be hard to avoid therefore everyone needs to think carefully about whether or not to carry out this plan after raising the issue with ye wo moini added these are the three issues I want to address I do not oppose your idea but if you really want to build a super safe Zone you cannot avoid facing these problems we need to think carefully yiu smiled and replied of course the issues you raised are very practical and need to be addressed does anyone else have any opinions please feel free to voice them and I will answer all as soon as he finished speaking moai prays zangu idea is indeed bold but I trust is Judgment I fully support this plan liai said seriously this idea may seem dreamy at first glance but if it was proposed by ywu I'm sure he has feasible calculations that we have not considered panga nodded in agreement that's right it is precisely because of Yu's presence that I feel things that seem too difficult suddenly become feasible not only Pang ha but even moong spoke up vwo then please elaborate on your specific plans yiu with a determined expression replied doubt or fear arises from the unknown Wilderness is the same although we have had some understanding of the Wilderness over the past few hundred years that knowledge is still very limited and not comprehensive however there are those who dare to try and I believe we can do it y Wu pointed to the screen and said with this map we can choose a safe route steering clear of the Beast infested areas to create a bridge between the two major cities around the bridge we will build Transportation routes and information stations then gradually expand the area while eliminating the beasts during this process we will also control the dungeons along the way this issue is actually not too difficult to resolve he continued the Wilderness always symbolizes the unknown and full of dangers but at the same time it also contains vast resources that have yet to be explored we can leverage these resources as a springboard for development hearing this Liah asai was somewhat skeptical and asked how detailed is this Wilderness map I find its information even richer than the top secret maps our Corporation has drawn M added indeed it seems yiu you have prepared very thoroughly however Pang haua still had doubts he shook his head and said so many resources that have never been discovered until now such a waste of Heaven's gifts but y Woo is this map trustworthy seeing that everyone was still not fully convinced Yi Wu plainly explained of course it is trustworthy this map comes from the legendary Wilderness Hunter Mo upon hearing this name the entire meeting room was stunned M long who had not heard mu's name for a long time could not hide his excitement it truly has been a long time since I heard this name but if it is his Masterpiece then it is surely accurate with the help of this map building a super safe Zone will be many times more effective after a long hesitation he continued but surely you are well aware of the value of this map you could easily keep it for your own use why are you willing to share it with us y Wu presenting himself as a leader calmly laid out his perspective if it were me before I might have hesitated but after going through a series of events this time facing many formidable opponents one after another I realize that the strength of an individual is still limited especially when facing great dangers like the blood tide it is necessary to rely on a collective with similar strength at this moment he smiled happily and replied good for the saying move forward together Retreat Together live together die together without Yu's help my handm Mo group would have collapsed long ago in Wang jang's conspiracy now that you present such a sincere and appealing proposal how could I not be tempted immediately M continued to question y Wu so how you plan to deal with the newly emerged Beast hordes and the random fog zones and how can you avoid conflicts with other major territ teritories Yi Wu responded the newly emerged Beast hordes from the spatial Rifts and the random fog zones both stem from the distortions in spatial oscillation lii and I will create an observational testing field that can provide Advanced warnings he continued as for the issue of conflict between the major regions that is completely unavoidable I believe everyone is aware of what happened in K City because of me the Eastern region has likely targeted us from the very beginning but regardless of whether it is cooperation neutrality or emity that cannot hinder our determination to develop we just need to start out more humbly he nodded in agreement with yiwu's opinion that's right the relationships between the major regions are all based on interests if interests conflict turning against each other is just a matter of time therefore to survive we cannot rely on the charity of others there is no such thing as a risk-free Endeavor if we want to survive and develop we must be aware of facing new problems without experiencing pain one cannot grow after that Mo zlom declared I as the deputy president of hanmo Corporation will fully support yiwu's plan even if we have to exhaust all our resources we must successfully build the super safe Zone and gain everyone's support molom partnered with ywu and continued whether it is in Manpower or financial resources the company will dedicate all its strength to support you you can proceed according to your ideas the entire hanm Mo Corporation will be your strongest backing Yi Wu responded to that sincerity promising rest assured I will definitely not let everyone down G wine Chuan gaze from a distance looked at them filled with admiration Liu's words not only show his determination but also highlight the vast distance between him and me if I don't quickly become stronger I won't be able to become a force that helps him but how can I catch up to him Moi folded her arms looked at moii and asked this time Yi Wu truly treats our hand mole like home so when will you become one of his family hearing this m n blushed and awkwardly replied you what are you talking about seeing that Mo laughed look at your expression a grown girl can't hold back anymore on the rooftop ywu approached the balcony looked at xao chin and asked have you been having fun these past few days Uncle sh chin laughed heartily in response haha of course the Beauties in this safe zone are top-notch and the good wine is even sweeter making it enchanting he continued his tone filled with excitement thanks to you I've made a fortune it feels like I could retire now yiu smiled faintly as long as you're happy Uncle next come with me to a place the space gate opened sha Chen agreed but still asked in confusion all right where to Yu replied nonchalant of course it's back home light appeared as yiu continued back home Joe Chen stepped out unable to help but exclaim oh my God kid you really in front of the two of them was a welcoming scene that had been prepared in advance receiving a warm welcome yiu beaned replying everyone I'm back Yu's father joyfully saidon you are back y Yan F walked over to her brother and gently called called brother Nana quickly ran after them her face beaming master master Nana has been waiting for you for so long Yu looked at everyone and softly asked have you all been doing well these past two days the time before really made you all suffer a lot Kai katai stepped up wrapping an arm around Yu and said with a smile why woo your safe return is the most important thing welcome back Yu nodded gently yeah I'm fine Yu's father and mother stood by watching the scene secretly thinking could it be that during our absence these two kids experienced something good at that moment a robotic maid approached carefully handing Yu a chip and said master I have followed your instructions and completed the construction of the base please confirm yigu took it smiling as he said everyone has worked hard he looked at the imposing magnificent base in front of him and couldn't help but exclaim finally it's finished now I have my own home I Vis appeared beginning to introduce the overall situation of the base I said Yes master the overall situation of the stronghold is as follows the central area is the heart of the stronghold and only the master has the authority to enter and exit other functional areas are divided into zones including the living area Entertainment area ecological planting area and weapon manufacturing area the outermost Circle consists of a large number of Defense units the master can renovate or update at any time all areas are assigned Patrol and defense Personnel ensuring safety one could say that whatever you want it's all there the entire strong hold is covered by a gigantic Shield y Wu enthusiastically prays great great the functions are very complete he then turned to father and mother asking father mother are you familiar with this his father replied Familiar of course compared to the highlevel living quarters of hanmo this place is even better y Wu laughed haha y yanf also contributed although we only been here for a short time we can escape the oppression of the apocalyptic era our meals are abundant and there are even entertainment devices the baby beetles are also very nice to us compared to the outside this place feels like a paradise it's hard to imagine that just a few months ago we had to fight in that dungeon y wo patted gun's head and said as long as everyone is happy that's enough your hard work can be considered worthwhile she replied yeah it's thanks to you baby Beetle flew over and exclaimed Li Woo you're back y Wu smiled it's been a long time baby Beetle he asked so has the construction of the Bas caused any negative impact on your production for example has it harmed World culture or affected ecological balance baby Beetle took out a remote control and said don't worry this Bas is like blending into this world it helps humans and the insect race two species with different civilizations and Technologies Unite with each other it's amazing just take a look after saying that baby Beetle pressed a button on the remote control in front of them appeared images of Nana Yan and baby Beetle watching cartoons together y this is a recording from before right the baby beels seem to enjoy it next came images of Yu's mother and others harvesting fruits I this explained they have applied the most Advanced Techniques brought by Yi Wu and Mr Li jasai as a result the time for harvesting agricultural products has significantly increased and the yield has also grown remarkably when Neu saw his father working with n on something he exclaimed this place must definitely be a the mechanical crafting Hub father it turns out you really like this place the most hearing this his father smiled happily haa you still remember this little hobby of mine researching mechanics is really interesting and Nana helps me with a lot of things after the presentation ended ye Wu turned and asked by the way weren't there people opposing this before is there anyone left to argue now baby Beetle replied actually most of them have been subdued by your base only a small group grp of stubborn ones remain but I've exiled them to the edge of the world they can't stir up any trouble anymore at this moment Mi ba stepped forward and announced Master dinner is ready everyone let's go to the dining area all right Mio bow Yu turned back and waved to the whole family let's go this is our first reunion dinner in the new home I can't wait any longer Yun was running and said okay shoen stood with his arms crossed and seeing this he spoke up hey hey what's with this warm and cozy scene of the family having a reunion meal it doesn't match the vibe of the apocalyptic era at all does having power mean you can do anything you want he looked at ywu his eyes filled with meaning this kit is really not simple inside the dining hall everyone raised their glasses in unison everyone was cheerful and enthusiastically enjoying themselves Yu stepped outside and saw three people sitting in front he asked what are you three talking about l king Yun smiled and replied yo y woo are you out here at catch some fresh air too another person chimed in of course we are talking about you baby Beetle sitting next to them joined the conversation after all all these Earth shattering changes are thanks to you ywu sat down his eyes revealing a thoughtful expression he recall the tumultuous events that had transpired over the past period Then he said with a serious tone perhaps what I'm about to say will surprise you all Lan King Yun asked curiously what are you planning to do yiu spoke slowly I want to build a super safe Zone stretching from the southwest safe area all the way to the K City area this will be an unprecedented large project l king Yun exclaimed in Surprise no wonder you are who you are this idea is truly groundbreaking another person slammed the table excitedly oh my this plan is truly enticing for those with grand Ambitions this is an opportunity that cannot be missed not only does it have the potential for profit but it will also provide safety for those struggling in the wilderness whatever you need just say it I will definitely support you wholeheartedly the group was in awe seemingly feeling the way of Yu's words and plans Lan King Yun said but the difficulty of this matter is not small besides the issues everyone has raised in the meeting there are also various armed forces in the wilderness which is a significant obstacle most of them are very rebellious I am sure they will not easily give up their power for the safe Zone to take over especially now that wui has been eliminated the situation in the wilderness will definitely return to chaos with factions splitting and vying for power everyone wants to become the next wui y Wu replied I understand this when the time comes I will directly negotiate terms with them building a super safe Zone will not only not affect their current interests but will even bring benefits and opportunities they never expected however if they remain stubborn and refuse to cooperate I will not hesitate to let them experience the same fate as wuji Yi Wu continued for the initial negotiation can I leave it to you guys after all you are from the Wilderness and talking to them will definitely be more effective than someone from the safe Zone Lan King Yun and mayi nodded both happily accepting the order of course I will make use of all my connections to persuade the disobedient forces we must make them understand that the super safe zone is the best path for the future at this moment baby beetles spoke up seeing you well so spirited I want to go to your world to take a look even more but after my unil passed away his time travel experiment was also canceled y Wu spoke up our world is not as beautiful as you think baby Beetle thought for a moment and then replied if we talk about the good side then then perhaps the world is vast and has Limitless unknowns but if we look at the bad side it is full of accidents and dangers at any moment one could face the risk of losing their life compared to that your world is indeed better he continued oh and there are shooting stars too Let's Make A Wish as he spoke he looked up at the sky but soon after he noticed something strange wait a minute these are not ordinary shooting stars it seems like there are more and more a meteor shower the green gas orbs flew past the place where Yu's group was sitting l king Yun spoke up her voice full of doubt that's not right these are not shooting stars this is a huge explosion of blinding light shattered everything and small rocks were flung away at that moment y Yan fi and several others rushed over she anxiously asked brother we heard a very loud noise inside the house what on Earth is happening out outside Nana also worriedly asked is something going on outside right at that moment the emergency alarm sounded warning warning intrusion of space detected the base defense system is being activated y Wu furrowed his brow feeling increasingly anxious sha Chen stepped forward his voice calm yet serious I told you before there is no place safe in this world anymore not even in this dungeon it seems this time I was unfortunate enough to to be right y woo y wo replied it's okay no matter who invades anyone who dares to disrupt my happiness will definitely have to die he looked at I Vis and asked this dungeon has a five-star compatibility mode right how come we just set up the base and are already facing trouble like this I VI stammered in response I I'm fine Master the absolute compatibility is definitely not a problem there must be some other reason as he spoke I VI checked the system panel suddenly he exclaimed in Surprise AE just now when I scanned the compatibility was five stars why has it suddenly changed to Zen Chang six stars could it really be a bug how is that possible ywu speculated the sudden increase in compatibility must be related to this meteor shower could it be that there is something good hidden in that meteorite he continued this is the time to unleash the potential of the new account system switch to the account the Peeping one of the low car Dimension immediately the system announced switch to the account the Peeping one of the low car Dimension a dazzling beam of light Shone around in the sky a giant robot appeared Yi Wu thought to himself in an instant a massive amount of information flooded into my brain everything transformed into visible data this feeling is truly unbelievable he used a robot to detect a crack in space he wondered is this space face crack caused by a meteorite it looks like it's shrinking but it can't completely heal the system explained this crack is a primordial crack that has existed in the space of the dungeon inside the crack one can sense endless chaos and Distortion this could be some kind of SpaceTime energy objects from other Realms have the ability to pass through this crack to reach this Dimension yiwu's mind raced with tension it seems that the sword Saint the lone may have also crossed over from this crack assuming the meteorite and the lone did not come from the same world this means the crack connects two or more foreign spaces if left unchecked who knows what else will cross over here the system continued to scan the surroundings and reported detection of small-scale spatial corrosion at the Target Yu was determined regardless of whether there are good items or hidden dangers I must definitely go check it out suddenly the baby Beetle ran over and said yay woo if you want to go check it out take me with you that direction happens to be a location where I stashed a lot of treasure even if they are the enemy still they are the people of my kind I cannot abandon them y Wu agreed and said but we must prepare thoroughly before going after all we don't know what is waiting over there he turned back to weeville and said I'm sorry Uncle I originally intended to treat you very well but encountering this I can't leave you behind ail replied cheerfully it's okay you go handle it no need to worry about someone idle like me if you need help just say a word y Wu thank the kind intention of the uncle but added I can handle it there's no need to trouble you anymore evil glanced at Yu and the baby Beetle leaving taking a sip of wine he thought to himself it seems this kid doesn't want to continue owing me a favor anymore but that's what he says it's quite boring here how about I sneakily follow and check it out as soon as you would return to the base he immediately ordered Iz activate the defensive mechanism of The Outpost now Iz replied understood the highest level defense order was activated an energy Shield covered the entire base and Chang anxiously asked yiu only you and the baby Beetle are going is there really no issue yiu conly replied no need to worry this type of risk I have anticipated early on and I have also devised a response plan in front of them were three giant robots equipped with modern weapons you introduced welcome everyone to my weapons Depot and Chang exclaimed in astonishment is this an arms exhibition suddenly three female subordinates appeared a blonde one reported Master the preparations are almost complete we can deploy at any time Yu nodded in satisfaction well done you all have worked hard everyone's gaze turned towards the massive vehicle nearby sh spoke up Le wo can we use these things Yu replied of course all the equipment has been registered with your information feel free to use whatever you want and Chang joyfully exclaimed awesome fatty I'm tired of that car I've been wanting to switch to something cooler Juan how quickly climbed onto a large motorcycle he smiled and asked your equipment really makes one eager to try it out but I guess you must have set up many addition functions can we operate them in fight ywu stepped closer to the fighter jet silently thinking after the last battle I need to learn how to conserve energy for long range fights like this it's better to use the fighter jet to move he instructed the system switch to the ace pilot account chasable the system replied the initial driving skill account has been upgraded to 100% you woned the protective suit Juan Hal saw this and was astonished exclaiming wow you even know how to Pilot a fighter jet I really want to ask is there anything you w doesn't know how to do he did not respond calmly entering the fighter jet the machine then announced the master has completed preparations for takeoff ready to depart at any time before leaving one how reminded leave the defense at the base to us wish you a smooth Journey Yi Wu smiled and replied okay go ahead and command loudly the fighter jet quickly soared away leaving the base as it approached the meteor storm area a Strange Fire erupted violently Illuminating a corner of the sky brightly a subordinate of Austin 's questioned Master what is it after all Austin 's replied one can feel a great surge of power and a vague sound calling me could this be a hint from the heavens the subordinate then asked but sir this meteorite came in a very peculiar way almost destroying our gathering place is it dangerous Austin alss Furious clawed at the subordinate's face he shouted what do you know this is a heaven sent opportunity for us if we can harness the energy from this meteorite we will have the chance to drive Humanity out over for of the current royal regime and establish a new world order the subordinate cried out in pain Austin Al's wife hurried over clean to his arm pleading my dear please don't do that if you do the world will plunge into war again though the present days are very difficult at least there is stability no fear for the sake of our child who can grow up healthy can you not initiate War again he immediately pushed her down to the ground then shouted angrily what do you know what does this artificial piece mean it's just looking up and watching others be controlled by humans the world of the insect species should be controlled by the insect species I must drive all the beings from the otherw world out the lady lay on the ground groaning in pain two of his subordinates hurried to help her up one anxiously reminded Le be careful my Lord the lady is pregnant at that moment Austin L suddenly comprehended he exclaimed in astonishment then turned around abruptly after that he commanded leave one person to take care of the lady the others will follow me this is an order the group of subordinates responded in unison yes as they ventured deeper in they saw a gigantic blue meteor shining brightly Austin ow exclaimed in astonishment it's a blue meteor how truly breathtaking this scenery is suddenly he signaled to stop and asked wait do you hear something the piercing sounds emanating from the meteorite compelled the subordinates to cover their ears standing before the Colossal meteorite Austin El shouted it's a god a God is calling me oh God please grant me strength the subordinates painfully called out my Lord wait oh it hurts so much it hurts so much it feels like something is crawling into my head at this moment the vines wrapped tightly around the lady of Austin 's she screamed in agony Austin please save me he replied lady just accept it submit and then bear Offspring for me the system announced estimated time to location 3 minutes remaining the warship sped forward baby Beetle praise as expected of the alang gako account the feeling of control is completely different from MOSI the handling is so smooth like you are a combination of man and machine suddenly a lot of strange likes appeared before them baby Beetle quickly warned Yu be careful it seems there's something flying towards us the alarm system blared warning a large quantity of high energy projectiles detected ahead approaching rapidly please prepare for engagement highresolution images from the camera are projected on the main screen hypothesizing that the flying objects are otherworldly dead entities their bodies mingled with insect species power unknown baby Beetle asked in Surprise Zerg flesh could it be that Austin and his group have the bullets flew straight towards the fighter aircraft y Wu reminded there's no time left breakthrough head-on if you don't dare to bathe in the storm of bullets how can you claim to be a master engineer their fighter aircraft began firing energy beams C cusing the bullets to explode baby Beetle exclaimed in astonishment wow yiu is amazing with bullets flying thick like this none of them hit him suddenly baby Beetle started to vomit he wondered but why is a flying beetle shaking so much that I feel like throwing up the system unexpectedly sounded an alarm warning a large amount of Airborne power has appeared ahead it is speculated that the mutated insect species has undergone transformation in front of them a giant swarm of bees with long sharp Stingers was charging towards them baby Beetle lamented Here We Go Again an endless bombardment he anxiously asked aren't these insect species the ones I exiled even if they are wild flying insect species there shouldn't be so many and they're also transformed in such a bizarre way I suspect this might be related to that strange gem the fighter aircraft began firing energy beams again attacking the swarm of bees the system announced the fighter Shield index is at 70% the remaining force of the enemy is at 70% ywu was focused on controlling the fighter jet while confidently saying you think you can repress me with numerical superiority how naive as soon as he finished peing he pressed the red button on the control panel instantly a swarm of small fighter jets were launched from his jet forming a dense formation Yu chuckled softly and said I never said I would fight alone he commanded go lead the insect species to converge in One Direction then the small fighter jets immediately deployed surrounding the enemy and driving them towards a single point then Yi Wu shouted loudly seductive figure in an empty chess board a massive explosion rang out Flames erupting violently across the battlefield the system reported enemy forces remaining 60% Yu did not stop he shouted one more time attack a barriage of bullets was fired and the small fighter jets charged directly into the formation of the insects a piercing scream rang out ah ah the system continued to announce enemy forces remaining 40% after a devastating Blow from y Wu The Enemy forces dropped to 20% in an instant this number fell to zero the system reported enemy Airborne forces have been completely annihilated time 10 seconds y Wu Commander bring the fighter jets closer to the Target area as we approached the Colossal asteroid he furrowed his brows and wondered what is this could it be that the bullets flying before were all fired by it baby Beetle replied our world has not seen this kind of bizarre and evil object it must be due to that meteorite but nearby I can't sense Austin's energy could it be that something truly happened to them Yu's warplanes shot beams down to the ground trying to destroy the meteorite you urged don't be pessimistic like that we'll know if we go down the check seeing the strange blue flames nearby baby Beetle said I found the concentration area of Austin they are close by although they weren't affected by a meteorite there is still no sign of anyone it seems they just left here not long ago could it be that they went into this deep hole he bent down to pred the hole and asked oh y woo what are you so fascinated by Yu replied it seems that the secrets hidden in your world are more than I imagined baby Beetle looked down into the deep hole each layer of soil contained Villages he wondered why does our world conceal this secret I had read all the ancient books and manuscripts left behind but I have never seen any mention of this place's existence ye wo worriedly said from the degree of erosion of the ruins it seems that the time it has existed May exceed our imagination even your adventurous Spirit hasn't discovered this then it's impossible for others to detect it he thought silently then continued the name of this dungeon is newer Temple previously we always thought that the Holy Temple referred to the ancient Zerg God buried underground could it be that we were mistaken this place in front of us is the true newer Temple thinking for a moment he urged let's go we need to explore below first baby Beetle replied okay suddenly the system announced account for dimensional Observer Luke has been changed delving deeper inside Yi Wu contemplated each level of the ruins contains fragments of Dimensions it seems that this ruin was originally in architecture from various timelines brought here but due to the spatial Rifts compression it was damaged during the time travel eventually becoming the chaotic form it is now perhaps the sudden increase in compatibility of the dungeon is related to these ruins there might be some treaches inside and I will sees the opportunity to explore when the two of them had just descended to the bottom of the cave they suddenly heard a shrill scream ahw you we asked whose agonizing cry is that baby beo replied that sound seems to resemble that of the Austin family I must quickly go save them Yu placed a hand on the Rock and reminded don't act rashly I have a bad feeling about this we must proceed with caution baby Beetle responded M at this moment Austin's wife was screaming in pain oh after a while many eggs were born around each egg luminous spots appeared baby Beetle wondered is this the pregnant wife of Austin and is she being controlled to become an egg Lane tool meanwhile Austin and his minions raised their hands to petition mother God wishing to drive away the humans suddenly loud e sounds echoed fiercely the eggs kept exploding and scorpions began to crawl out eek they were screaming while rushing into the cave and he commanded reclaim the heart of the insect species baby Beetle furiously smashed the rock shouting damn it my people have been tortured into this state I can't hold back any longer regardless of the origins of this Stone I Must Destroy You Yu shouted wait baby Beal let me dare to touch the heart of the insect species let's see if I can burn you to ashes saying that he drew this sharp sword filled with killing intent and stepped forward baby Beetle froze feeling the pain in its head like a hammer strike it quickly reported that thing gives me an Indescribable feeling of discomfort like there are countless people flying around my head Whispering softly you have to be careful hearing that Yu replied guide in such a difficult situation Yu kept racking his brain searching for a solution he realized inside the crystal exists a mysterious substance it's this substance that has increased the compatibility of the dungeon by one star he told himself it seems I have to be careful when I act don't destroy that thing suddenly Yu's weapon and energy armor vanished leaving him very surprised a loud alarm rang out warning warning detection of a powerful strange energy contamination to ensure the safety of the account the system has forcibly disabled most accounts currently only the Fallen Valkyrie account is available ywu asked in shock what it's polluted the system immediately explained this could be severe Cosmic air pollution coming from a certain Dimension any organic or inorganic entities within its radius will be affected and lead to mutations hearing this he exclaimed Cosmic great m is terrifying but why hasn't the Fallen Valkyrie account been affected the system hypothesized perhaps it's because the female Marshall God has already been contaminated by the void the pollutant is speculated to be similar to Blue crystallization hence it is not impacted ywu clicked his tongue what truly a play of Fate he mumbled his face brunching up I'm not even mentally prepared to use a female account just thinking about the scenario of disguising as a girl may Yu feel chills cold sweat running down his spine afterwards he summoned his wings to fly alongside baby beel the plan has changed we will go protect the heart of the insect species first and later we will deal with that bizarre thing baby Beetle immediately complied without any objections while flying Yi Wu drop bombs onto the ground constantly pondering these warm eggs seem to be able to explode continuously I need to set up some landmines along the way to hinder their reinforcements gradually a dense array of landmines with a destructive power of level 100 was formed after flying for a while the system announced you have left the signal disturbance radius all recovery account are functioning normally hearing this yiu immediately commanded switch to the all mangako account increase speed in the blink of an eye he shop forward like an arrow surpassing the speed of sound a thunderous boom echoed through the air in another Battlefield the monster Brigade equipped and ready Was preparing to charge one of the monsters shouted joyfully haha the core is right in front of us as long as we can seize it this world will be ours suddenly ly the ground beneath them shook violently a gigantic worm unexpectedly emerged throwing their formation into disarray what is that the monster screamed in panic it was the sandstorm Incubus a level 120 creature furiously attacking the Brigade it roared menacingly the monster Commander coldly uttered you betrayed the insect species and kneel before humans he laughed confidently no worries a wild beast like you can never stop the army blessed by the mother God he waved his hand commanding soldiers charge the soldiers rushed forward continuously shouting their cries echoing throughout the battlefield the two sides collided fiercely and the fighting situation became incredibly intense Sandstorm Incubus continuously used its sharp teeth to tear apart the monsters that were lunging at it the sound of screaming echoed Without End looking at the gigantic form of Sandstorm Incubus one would think it could easily defeat the minions however these monsters were enveloped in a tough blue crystal layer this armor prevented Sandstorm incubus's teeth from piercing through and even the outer shell of the baby Beals became a significant barrier aha you are no longer the terrifying Sandstorm Incubus of the past we are blessed by the crystallized mother God you are nothing to be afraid of meanwhile Sandstorm Incubus was powerless in this situation the monsters encouraged Unleashed wave after wave of attacks covering its entire body the numerous wounds cause the giant worm to ride and moan despite struggling and roaring frantically grur the health and energy of Sandstorm Incubus continuously plummeted from 80% down to 60% then to only 40% when its life force was reduced to about 1/5 the monsters gathered to cast a spell a high voltage current surrounded the entire body of Sandstorm Incubus making it jerk violently h the agonizing whales echoed seeing the effect the commander urged continue the attack without my orders you are not allowed to stop in a short time the sandstorm Incubus had fallen into a critical state with only 5% of its blood left it struggled to break free letting out weak whimpers but every effort was in vain the commander snickered coldly and said you are so loyal to humans that you won't let us pass even if we spare your life then I shall fulfill your wish before he could finish his sentence an aircraft suddenly swooped down continuously firing at the monsters to provide cover for the sandstorm Incubus shock waves swept through and dust filled the air one monster stood in confusion and asked humans how do you know we are here at that moment yiu landed beside the sandstorm Incubus he gently said you've worked hard Sandstorm Incubus from now on we will fight side by side yiu activated the system Avis used the Pandora box to mechanize an Army and the sandstorm Incubus the system's voice echoed received signal from the master proceeding with harmonizing mechanization all over the giant worm's body an Exquisite layer of metallic scales grew in the blink of an eye the transformation was complete the sandstorm Incubus version mechanical demonic creature appeared beside Yu the roar that emanated sounded like machinery exuding Pride gr gr gr the system notification Fusion complete the commander hurriedly commanded attack but at that moment the mechanical worm easily tore through the defenses of the monsters it swiftly vaporized a large area and the cries of the people echoed throughout the land and Sky how is this possible you crushed the essence of the mother God in another development baby Beetle flew in front of the insect species and said I know you are being controlled by that unknown evil material while there is still a chance to remedy the situation stop what you are doing I will not hold you accountable one of the individuals below surprise question back control foolish being chosen by the mother God is an honor for us look under the blessing of the mother God we have achieved an unprecedented Evolution we have surpass normal insect species soon this world will belong to us he acted arrogantly exuding a challenging demeanor seeing that the opponent showed no signs of repentance baby Beal retorted I never wanted to use this move but don't let evil consume you anymore wake up with that he Unleashed asteris Regal domination asteris a special ability inherited from the king of the insect species this skill had the power to suppress his kin restoring their rationality and compelling them to submit under the influence of the ability the insects suddenly regained their awareness they looked around in bewilderment and stammered king of woo I what have I been doing we never wanted this it's just there's been this strange voice in our minds that whisper Amplified our anger and desires to the extreme forgive us king of woo please save us their pleas for help had barely ended when each of them had their heads suddenly explode baby Beetle froze in stunned horror watching his kin slaughtered so mercilessly his body shook with rage he soared into the sky his determination blazing damn it I'll kill whoever did this y woo witnessing his teammate lose control quickly flew up to intercept him don't act rashly baby Beetle that guy is far too sinister if you keep going like this you'll end up being controlled too leave him to me baby Beetle had just regained his composure he said I'm sorry you woo although it is crucial not to have distractions during battle I still ask you to definitely save Austin's wife and him after all he is my subject and I don't want to watch them die with my eyes wide open you must think I am hesitating indecisive and not making progress right I apologize but ye W did not blame him he empathized with his friend in front of him as the king of a tribe cruelty can be easily seen But kindness and benevolence are very difficult just be yourself you and Sandstorm Incubus will protect here in the hearts of the in sex species the rest is up to me baby Beetle was touched mom but Yu's actual thoughts were different the important thing is if I open a female account and someone else sees it I fear I will never be able to hold my head up high for the rest of my life Austin's wife cried out in pain a my children are all dead my children she screamed her eyes streaming with tears Austin stood proudly in front of her stretched out his arms wide and said do not be sorrowful as long as you have the strength of mother God you can continue to reproduce to Bear children for the deity is our honor he continued as long as we can seize the hearts of the insect species we can drive the king's turn and Humanity away reclaiming the world that rightfully belongs to us suddenly a loud explosion rang out the continuous rumbling sound shook the entire area Austin eles startled and shouted who dares to disrespect the Divine from the sky ye W descended he spoke coldly indeed the usual tactics are useless but your tricks of pretending to be of God only make me more curious about what you're hiding inside y w activated all his attributes boosting his energy and immediately deployed a protective shield upon seeing him appear Austin ows roared you the instigator you dare to come here alone I will turn you in nourishment for the mother God as he spoke he immediately threw a powerful punch at Yu Yu quickly used his shield to block the blow but the force from the punch was too powerful causing the shield to shatter the tremendous shock wve sent Yu's body flying and he thought to himself this is not good even though I have prepared multiple layers of Shields and attribute enhancing potions fighting against a being over a 100 Levels higher is truly difficult seeing yiu at a disadvantage Austin Al's laughed triumphantly why have you weakened so much where did your Emperor's aura from before killing you now won't bring any satisfaction at all then in his hand he was preparing to launch a blue attack at that moment y Wu had already flown into the air avoiding that attack in his mind he silently thought if I disregard their lives and directly open the Fallen Valkyrie account to kill everything it would be easy however I promised baby Beetle that I would save them so I have to make it happen taking advantage of The Little Speed I have left I need to figure out how to cut off the crystals control over Austin he saidou running pretty well aren't you as he spoke he continuously launched attacks aimed at Yu to break his armor the ground and Stones around him cracked whenever they were hit seeing the situation before him ywo Stood Still The One named Austin spoke up I'll kill you then it's that kingk turn as long as I collect the heart of the insect species I can lead the insect species to the peak of Glory hearing this ywu shouted loudly don't Harbor such delusions everything is merely a mysterious Crystal covered witer coat that's been bestowed upon you wake up and see reality then suddenly a bolt of energy lightning struck directly at Austin he screamed in pain unable to move anymore the lightning restrainer was activated the system announced lightning restrainer this is a device taken from wui created by Tian Kon it has the capability to bind enemies up to level 130 for a duration of 30 minutes if the enemy's level exceeds 130 The Binding time will be reduced by 90% yiu said this thing was originally a failed product manufactured by Tian Chan to limit the ancient gods but using it on you is sufficient as he spoke he gently dusted off the dust lingering on the Hem of His clothes he angrily shouted despicable human daring to use dirty tricks even if you kill me it will be useless the mother God will not stop breeding endlessly our army is Limitless sooner or later we will flatten this land at that time you your friends and your family will all die in the most painful and miserable way haha suddenly he felt a sharp pain from his head a strange helmet was placed on him the clarity helmet created by tand con the only successful experiment capable of preventing external mental interference helping to concentrate and maintain one's Consciousness seeing him in such Agony Yu spoke if it weren't for baby Beetle asking to spare your life just based on what you just said I would have more than enough reason to kill you a thousand times already Yu continued but instead of sinking into impossible Illusions it is better to open your eyes wide and see what you have done from afar Austin's wife screamed in pain husbands save me Austin seeing the scene before him panicked and exclaimed lady what what am I doing a I remember now I was enchanted by that cursed Crystal how could I have done such unforgivable things why was I so foolish he approached y Wu knelt down and bowed his head pleading I'm sorry it was my mistake I should not have become your enemy please save my wife I beg you hearing this ye wo soared into the sky and landed even if you don't say it I will take action what I promised baby Beetle I will certainly accomplish but when I act later it may affect the surroundings it is best for you to hide far away after I sever the link between the Crystal and your wife quickly take her away from here hearing him say that Austin lowered his head and replied yes yes thank you thank you you w thought it seems that the crystal has undergone some changes previously it was just an obscure black object but now it has taken on a heart-like shape it appears that that mother God is not far from manifesting I must seize the time Yu moved closer to the mysterious blue crystal it was surrounded by Massive strands Austin's wife's connector tube is the crucial Bridge it must be severed immediately Yi Wu launched an attack slicing straight towards the crystal the system suddenly sounded a warning warning warning the host has reached the limit the mental pollution level is currently at 100% which will cause significant damage that cannot be reversed the system reported the Dragon ey ring is embedded in the magic ring it has the potential to help maintain the clarity of human will enhance willpower and mental strength the fanged Dragon Sword made from the sharp fangs of a dragon is sharpened into a lethal sword that can enhance damage by 50% especially when attacking enemies with less than 30% Health additionally when equipped with the dragon iring the user will be immune to mental control skills such as paralysis confusion and enhanced resistance to abnormal stat status effects ye W spoke for now it's fine a while ago different auras dropped this piece of equipment that I hadn't used yet and today it can finally come into play he swung his sword in a rapid succession towards the crystal the system announced increasing spiritual contamination speed it can be reduced but not completely immune please be cautious host spiritual contamination level at 30% Austin's wife screamed in pain a Austin save me hearing his wife's plea Austin could only rely on Yu then anxiously said lady I'm sorry please hold on for a little longer Lord dwo will surely save you he rescued her from the Crystal both of them soared into the air moving forward the system reported spiritual contamination level at 60% warning warning spiritual contamination is rising rapidly please host not letting the system finish ye wo immediately interrupted and replied it's fine I will switch to the Fallen Valkyrie account once it reaches the threshold spiritual contamination level at 80% right below the crystal hundreds of creatures began to move they emitted sounds eight yiu said Austin catcher Yu immediately threw the wife of that man towards him he quickly reached out to catch his wife saying lady the system announced mental pollution level 90% the monsters immediately headed towards him he knelt down on the ground shouted loudly system change switched to Fallen valky suddenly before he could finish his sentence Yu's entire being disappeared returning to the classroom the bewilderment was evident on his face yiwu's eyes widened unable to believe what was happening before him everyone around him turned to look at him each person confused by his attitude he looked out at the scenery outside and exclaimed a where is this the astonishment was clearly visible on his face M Li angry hit the board with her hand and shouted loudly vwo why are you looking out the window did you hear my question and report your answer if you want to play outside like that what about me and you standing in the hallway now Juan how spoke loudly you put too much importance on him Yu the student who is the worst in this class how would he know how to solve this kind of problem others hearing this not Ed in agreement and burst into laughter haha M shouted loudly if you can't answer then go stand in the hallway for me if you don't study don't affect other students upon hearing this you walked out with a displeased expression yes in his mind he thought something is wrong there's something off I have this feeling that I have forgotten something very important inside I feel a strong inner conflict but I can't express it in words he placed a hand on his head looking some exhausted what the hell is going on the more I think about it the more it hurts my head the class dismissal bell rang and everyone moved together to go home all joking and laughing in the hallway meanwhile Yu thought to himself I feel empty inside like I've lost something very important ahead were Juan Hal and SE G and they said hey the king the account launched a new version yesterday did you pull any cards Juan how replied of course I opened 10 new SS our accounts in one go that's the super cool Shadow King s g said danam you European Dog King account that name sounds a bit familiar it seems to be a very popular game recently yiwu's mind wandered suddenly a cheerful female voice shouted ah come and see it's senior G Wang Chun not only the most handsome guy in the school but also the student council president Handsome and Wealthy I want to date him so much the group of girls were excited to see their Idol appearing right before their eyes they surrounded the area where vangan was and couldn't stop their excitement on the other side the boys were also thrilled and called out Miss mokai is here too the Harris of the handm mo group the richest real estate business in the city who is not in the same class it's usually very hard to see her just look at that face that figure and that car everything is exquisite she's completely the goddess of my dreams she walked closer to the car that had its door open the boys watched with increasing excitement at that moment yiu felt exhausted sighed and continued to think that's the person who has won in life if I were like them having both money and being chaufer around that would be great unfortunately I can only fantasize about it in my dreams suddenly a hand touched Yu's shoulder and a voice said ha look at that silly face of yours what are you gay dreaming about y yanf appeared causing y Wu to open his eyes wide in Surprise seeing his brother suddenly crying y yanf quickly approached and asked ah are you okay why are you crying like this could it be that guy Juan hell bullied you I won't let him get away with it y Wu quickly wiped away his tears and replied it's not that it's probably just the wind in my eyes I'm fine Yun f sighed with relief and smiled saying that's good then let's go home it's getting late and we might miss the bus ywu nodded and thought H even though my mind is still chaotic I feel happy at this moment because at least I still have a home the two of them walked together towards the distant Sunset Dad Mom we're home Yeun feed called out as they arrived home and hearing this the family responded you're back Yan Fe turned to ask y woo M your house is on on the second floor right don't you want to come inside and hang out hearing her words y wo was a bit surprised she went inside the house hiding behind the door and continued but I still have so much homework to do today and there's also an online tutoring class later so I can't entertain you today let's meet another time so goodbye see you tomorrow having said that yanf Slamm the door shut leaving YW standing outside in confusion he couldn't believe what was happening he put his hands on his head and thought to himself I need to wake up my life has finally started to come back to me my home is no longer there 2 years ago my parents died in an accident and I was the only one who survived relying on the money saved from my parents house I barely get by as my childhood neighbor y Yan F's family living on the first floor has helped me a lot allowing me to get out of that dark period images suddenly flooded Yu's mind as he sat in the quiet house he couldn't stop thinking why could I forget even such an important thing am I running away but can I really Escape no matter how dark and desperate this reality is life must go on there are only a few months left until I graduate from high school then I will have to find a part-time job on the table there was still a box of beef noodles the phone displayed a notification electricity bill this month 100 water bill 20 housing Bill 30 management fee 180 internet 50 the remaining living expenses for this month is 120 A Familiar yet unfamiliar feeling this happiness I had once longed for but it seemed I had forgotten it y's gaze fell upon y Yan F's family they were enjoying their meal together chatting happily wow mom's cooking is so delicious I love this dish too Dad worked hard to cook today come on try this wow this is also really good ye woo thought but what am I thinking isn't this life something I have been used to for a long time why does today feel so different y Wu lay back on the sofa cushion angled down staring intently at the phone although I don't usually play games right now I can only rely on it to distract myself K account never heard of it must be a pay-to-play game let's see if I can play for free at that moment a notification from the game sounded hello esteemed contractor welcome back upon hearing that information yiu was astonished his eyes wide open exclaiming the host returned what do you mean I don't remember ever downloading this game let alone playing it the system promptly replied we have prepared a return gift package for you after receiving the gift package yiu immediately got a random account there are also these benefits he was surprised his fingers tapping on the phone's keyboard the system continued congratulations you have received the legendary SSR account the Fallen Valkyrie do you want to accept it now hearing this y Wu pondered this legendary account seems very powerful but what's it for then he pressed the red button next to it suddenly a bolt of lightning struck directly into the house immediately after a woman appeared she spoke excuse me are you my master Yu stare at her in confusion his tone bewildered do I know you but why does it feel both familiar and foreign please clarify what is happening to me she replied are you ready that statement left gwu bewildered exclaiming what ready for what the foam rang and a cold voice came through destroy the world destroy this fake world that is like [ __ ] Yu was taken AB unable to believe his ears destroy the world how could this happen am I not just dreaming in front of him a female Spirit appeared The Voice from the phone continued currently the place where the host is located is not the real world this is an illusion created by spiritual pollution to imprison Consciousness to return to the original World the host must break this pollution by destroying the illusion ye W trembled holding his head my head hurts too much although I have always doubted this world the memories of the past 10 plus years feel too real what is real what is fake how can I trust what you say the system reminded him the reason this world feels so real is that the pollution you are facing belongs to an extreme Cosmic level it can reconstruct a real world level Atomic in your Consciousness to hold your Consciousness and soul captive rendering you powerless to resist or hope the system paused for a moment then added fortunately when you were polluted a part of the power from the account switch to Fallen Valkyrie infiltrated your body it is precisely because of this that was able to connect and enter this world she continued although there is a limitation hce 61 as long as I can harness the power of the valkyrie I am sure I can Yun stepped forward and kicked the phone hard causing it to shatter into pieces don't listen to this phone talking nonsense yanf rushed forward and hugged y Wu are you okay I'm so worried about you this place is the world you have lived in for 17 years how can it be fake he was astonished looking up at her Yun Fe Yu's parents were also present and his father said Son could it be that you were too immersed in the game before confusing reality with some unreal things this is definitely some virus on the phone don't let it enchant you it's all an illusion you w try to refute no that's not right this world is completely different from the world in my memory I'm about to remember but it hurts so much yanf hugged him tighter don't remember those bad things isn't everything good right now if you feel lonely why not move in with me that way we can become a real family he repeated a real family she clearly revealed her dark intentions if you don't want a little sister we could still be closer as a household Yu's eyes widened as he realized this was not his world he pushed the fake yanf away causing the parents in the virtual world to become enraged V woo what are you doing how can you treat gunay like that she's only caring for you wanting what's best for you didn't you always want to become a family with us she was pushed away a bit surprised Yu began to gather his strength his voice cold the fake lies end here you people took advantage of my wavering Consciousness to commit unnatural acts but thanks to your performances I have inadvertently hit the right spot allowing me to fully awaken he stood up a killing intent radiating from him now you all can disappear at this moment the female demon began to tear apart the ver ual World Ugg spit however it did not completely disappear as the fake YF was still trembling and pleading why I love you so much why do you want to kill me yiu glared his gaze icy no matter what you are if you dare to exploit my bond with my family to imprison me then you must die the girl impersonating Yun Fe transformed her face becoming more horrifying haha it's astonishing how quickly you denied your true memories of 17 years your resilience surpasses my imagination but even if you regain your Consciousness you ultimately cannot escape from this world that it has prepared for you many beams of light targeted guwu but fortunately both he and the girl managed to evade she scoffed confronting this world ha an army below and helicopters above were all a at his position detecting the Target and executing a bombardment the building seemed on the verge of collapsing after being surrounded cries for help echoed help help ba the witch asked has it begun Yu is being shielded by her wings if I guess correctly these attacks are not directed at me but at you Marilyn Marilyn reveals little emotion as long as she can erase me from your Consciousness she can rebuild the prison world for me once again he somewhat disagreed but everything here is exploding as if a war is happening before I can destroy this world it might self-destruct first y Wu in Maryland looked towards the virtual world that was self-destructing Marilyn softly said but at least according to my speculation the laws of this world imprison me not kill me so even if I enter the Universe I can still live Yu laughed and said I used to often use a reverse faction account now on Earth in the eyes of those independently conscious beings created I would certainly become a grand faction of Destruction right Marilyn speculated Perhaps it is because of this Consciousness rule that the valkyrie who should be going crazy with iron can quietly listen to your commands ywu stood tall arms crossed looking around thoughtfully if this world was created based on my Consciousness can I also leverage it to enhance the valkyrie's abilities to a cosmic strategy level if so let's make it a bit bigger Marilyn sent nothing further and immediately used all her power to destroy this planet she began to unleash her strength completely obeying yiwu's command her sword cleaved the virtual Earth before her suddenly another demon appeared its voice filled with mockery it seems I underestimated you I didn't expect you to get to this point if a planet cannot contain you then I will use the whole universe Yu was not afraid if the one behind has shown himself then let's settle this with a battle of Victory and defeat Marilyn use your strongest move she complied with the command replying at your command master immediately after Marilyn transformed into a different form and launched a powerful strike directly at The Mastermind her weapon pierced deeply into him he can only scream in despair before collapsing y wo filled with confidence said you want to use the universe to imprison me then I will destroy this universe destruction Marilyn gradually returned to her original form youu looked at her and shook his head commenting after expending all her energy she returns to the D generate form what a Pity if that pure form could be sustained longer that would be better the two prepared to escape together Marilyn led the way through the dark tummel to return to reality while they were trying to pass through Yu pondered even in these shattered Stars I can sense a powerful spiritual pollution this opponent is indeed not ordinary but in any case it has come to an end once we are back in reality I will immediately destroy that crystallization suddenly mer clutched her head and cried out in pain ah yiu anxiously asked Marilyn what's wrong with you he began to think about her current state if I'm not mistaken it's because she's getting closer to reality that she is gradually transforming into a frenzy killing machine descending into depravity I must also prepare myself to Bear the risks of this account images from Marilyn's past began to appear around these images are her previous experiences could it be that the pollution in the universe resonated with her spirit creating these images in her Consciousness at the position where Yu was standing beings of light started to appear generating the pole is too strong just then the system unexpectedly displayed a notification activate hidden Mission enter the world of The Valkyrie save the valkyrie change the fate of depravity he felt confused system are you online now but what is a hidden Mission the system explained expained this hidden mission is a special Mission it can only be activated when the host is under specific conditions once missed the mission cannot be restarted he asked again does that mean there's only this chance to change Marilyn's wretched fate in front of them A Spacetime Rift appeared the entrance was close just one step away from returning to reality however yugu held Marilyn's hand leading her into another world to complete a hidden Mission vwo I'm not ungrateful you say me before and now it's time for me to save you both of them stepped through the SpaceTime Rift and yuu said let's go to your world maryn's world is called Asgard the realm of the Gods ye W wondered is this really Marilyn's world the system confirmed correct this is the world where the valkyrie Marilyn resides belonging to Asgard the realm of the Gods lingor this place was originally a paradise of the Gods but after thousands of years of pollution from the evil energy in the universe and is turned into a dwelling for ferocious and dangerous demonic beasts however apart from Maryland all accounts and items here have been restored and can be used normally additionally money from The Real World can be exchanged for currency in the current Dimension at a 1: one ratio the reminder system said one more thing the host has acquired a special limited ability of this Dimension time manipulation this ability allows me to freely accelerate or rewind the time stream of the current Dimension however it cannot be paused and can only be used in this Dimension the final mission in this Dimension is to prevent the valkyrie's fall upon completion the valkyrie's affection will be raised eliminating the debuff of indiscriminate killing Madness the valkyri account will restore its Divine form yiu felt invigorated as if he had just received great news my Powers have finally been restored to what they used to be strength surges throughout my body this feeling is one I haven't had in a long time the most important thing is that this time manipulation ability is incredibly enjoyable truly overpowered yeu continued with this ability even when facing the treacherous Realms of the Gods I can respond freely the accumulated frustrations of the past can finally be released the reward for this mission is precisely what I desire if I could also cancel the enforced transformation into a female that would be even better however the system advised don't think about that Yu asked again wait a minute if we stop the valkyri fall then she will welcome Happy doesn't that mean it's impossible to become a candidate the system replied not exactly while the host can prevent the valkyrie's fall the destruction of this world and the inevitable death of The Valkyrie cannot be changed you we've thought about the previous Dimension is it like lagona asserting he will become the Shadow King this is also a tragic to mention but then he felt very excited if that's the case then I definitely cannot let the rare Treasures of this world go to waste I must seize no I me protect them the system was also a loss for words when a group of neatly dressed people called out to him hey young man what are you doing here alone this place is very dangerous why not come with us to a safe location y w felt a little suspicious how can a local easily join them by the way this is a good opportunity to gather intelligence about this World thinking like that yiu quickly joined the group of locals the man driving the carriage who seemed to be the leader struck up a conversation with Y woo young man you don't look like a local could it be that you are a Wanderer from another world he continued but it's not surprising because the number of demonic beasts in our divine domain is increasing day by day more and more people are venturing out to exterminate demonic beasts but it is not easy for young people to do so as their number and ferocity are more terrifying previously our ymer village could not withstand the waves of attacks from demonic beasts so we had no choice but to relocate to a relatively safer Place Yu spoke up thank you Village chief for the warning but this place is a world under the protection of the Gods why are demonic beasts still so rampant are the gods neglecting this matter the village Chief explained it's not that the gods are unconcerned but they are too busy to take care of it for thousands of years the realm of the Gods has undergone many large-scale wars their divine power and military strength have suffered heavy losses he continued the Holy Temple can only focus its energy on countering greater threats Ordinary People Like Us can only protect ourselves and hope for blessings yiu thought to himself so this is a world full of dangers but it also means that treasures and opportunities are everywhere I absolutely cannot waste this chance I must seiz this opportunity to earn a big reward just then someone in the group shouted loudly signaling a warning ah the mountain monster has appeared haha so many humans brought to my door is indeed great luck today I can have a hearty meal the villagers panicked stop stop it don't let it rush through and harm the children and the elderly but it swung a large wooden Club causing everyone to fall over unable to resist it shouted get out you old men can only make sausages I want to eat the children and women their meat is more tender its gaze fell upon the mother and child in front hungrily let me have you two as an appetizer first haha the villagers were desperate thinking it's all over for us at that moment a hand severed the arm of the mountain monster it was not ywo but a strange girl who had appeared to save them the mountain monster roared aha without waiting for it to retaliate the girl snatched away its only eye causing it to to lose its strength to resist and collapse to the ground the villagers who witnessed the scene cheered joyfully Marilyn why did you just arrive now Marilyn who was now standing proudly on the corpse of the mountain monster was very different from Her Image in the virtual world with Y wo she said sorry killing the pursuers took a bit of time is everyone all right the villagers saw her and joyfully shouted it's okay it's okay but you really scared us earlier with shell Marilyn here our safety is definitely guaranteed he woo stood outside observing looking surprised and silently comparing this energetic personality is really different from the scheming Valkyrie I know is this her true nature Marilyn however he pretended not to know anything asked Village Chief who is that girl over there the Old Village Chief proudly introduced haha her name is Marilyn the little girl I found while hunting before but now she has grown up and become the hope of the entire her Village truly a comforting presence Yu was somewhat surprised by her background a abandoned girl huh both of them got on the carriage the honest Village Chief continued to tell that's right this girl has been clever and Lively since she was little she has grown up with the love of countless families everyone here considers her a part of their own family the old man explained further about the current situation besides she was born with great strength at such a young age she has taken on on the responsibility of hunting and protecting the village our village has been able to endure until now thanks to her liveliness but later on the Demonic beasts grew stronger and more aggressive forcing us to move Marilyn stood at the front announcing to everyone we can continue now hearing those confessions yiu thought to himself this time the mission is to go against the Shadow King to take care of The Valkyrie from her early days preventing her from becoming corrupted but the task of purif if ification is much harder than that of corruption it seems I must take advantage of the fact that I haven't yet affected this world utilizing time manipulation I need to fast forward the original timeline of this world to find the key points here to begin my intervention suddenly a shout rang out a huge level 120 mountain monster general jumped right in front of Marilyn with a spiked Mason hand he sneered it was this little Brack who killed my subordinate very good very good without a word of warning he struck first slamming the mace straight towards Marilyn's face she smirked coldly are you worthy of me taking action myself Marilyn was lucky to maintain her vigilance and Dodge to the side inside her mind she wondered how can a level 120 mountain monster appear here the figure of the monster zipped by in an instant leaving her no time to react so fast a thought popped into her head but before she could act the mountain monster grabbed the girl sending the great sword flying it mocked her where are you running to haha Marilyn silently compared her strength and speed to that of the monster I'm on a completely different level than it the villagers behind upon seeing this panicked and rushed to help Marilyn we're coming to help you she quickly shouted don't come over here it's not a monster we can deal with run away I'll think of a way to hold it back realizing the clear disparity between the two sides Marilyn knew that if she didn't stop it more people would perish the mountain monster gleefully sneered hold me back haha how do you intend to do that without hesitation Marilyn directed The Great Sword to charge forward and struck fiercely at the monster's hand it howled in shock a sword can attack on its own are you the valkyrie candidates seizing the opportunity Marilyn Broke Free from captivity and jumped back she shouted that's right even a monster like you knows of the existence of The Valkyrie so you should feel fear and run away though she spoke boldly inside she told herself even if this threat is useless at least it can buy time for the villagers to escape on the opposite side a mountain monster silently reached behind him secretly preparing a sneak attack but he still Fain surprise fear run immediately he threw a restraining cord that tightly wrapped around Marilyn his face lit up with delight as he laughed hardly haha what luck the valkyrie hasn't even fully materialized and already captured her my fortune is truly marvelous Marilyn horrified exclaimed this is she was stunned to realize her predicament this restraining cord cannot be cut as she desperately tried to escape by cutting with her sword her efforts were feudal watching his opponent struggle helplessly the mountain monster laughed loudly with Glee I worked hard to capture a candidate for the valkyrie like you I won't kill you just yet let me eat my Phill first and then I'll take my time to enjoy you haha Marilyn unwilling to accept her fate continued to struggle even if I die I will never succumb to your humiliation the monster seeing this became even more excited revealing its lewd face don't worry you can't die my hunting device has a sedative effect before you can successfully commit suicide you will lose Consciousness haha I didn't expect someone to come knocking so soon as y Wu approached it seemed like he wanted to devour him but your tiny body isn't even enough for me to shove into my teeth haha in an instant the monster's body was sliced apart in a Flash attack and it only had time to exclaim in denial a what just happened why am i y Wu coldly sent it to the leaderboard not forgetting to leave a comment look at this type of monster just looking it in the eye counts as me losing he then moved to help Marilyn sit up and inquired are you okay at this moment Marilyn was still dazed suddenly she spun around 180° gazing intently at him her eyes sparkling with excitement you were so impressive how could you do that just now can you teach me before she could finish speaking a sudden dizziness overwhelmed Marilyn causing her to lose Consciousness Yu saw this and immediately panicked he thought to himself indeed she is a lively girl maintaining her cheerfulness and optimism even in dangerous situations don't worry I will definitely help her keep this smile until the very end of the world with that thought he gently carried her to a resting place after a while Marilyn gradually came to she blinked her eyes looking around in confusion in front of her yiu was sitting and chatting with an elder the old man exclaimed I didn't expect ywu have such extraordinary strength I was conceited in wanting to protect him but it turns out I just made him see it as a joke y wo humbly replied Elder please don't say that I'm not that amazing Marilyn suddenly sat up and hurriedly said no no you're too humble you really are very impressive just like Glenn yiu smiled and turned to Marilyn asking you're awake but who is Glenn the Elder immediately explained Glenn is the instructor of our Valkyrie candidates and also a God yiu was surprised a God the old man said yiu is just come from the other world and does not yet understand the situation here have you ever heard of The Valkyrie yugu replied I have heard a little I am willing to listen to the details seeing this the old man began to explain the valkyrie is chosen by humans possessing high combat power they are young women who follow weat your humble servants into battle we your humble servants stipulate that every 10 years there will be a selection of The Valkyrie Marilyn is currently one of the valkyrie candidates she needs to go through the selection and grow to become the true Valkyrie Glenn is the instructor sent by the gods to train the valkyrie candidates he is a God not only possessing great strength but also having a glorious image admired by many girls The Village Chief continued to introduce y Wu to the organization rules and Glenn's identity Marilyn excitedly praised that's right although Glenn is very strong ye woo you can kill a level 120 Elite monster in one blow your strength is almost on par with him moreover you are still a human yiu quietly observed and discovered that Marilyn's favorability towards Glenn was 50% while towards him it was only 30% he thought to himself favorability what the hell is that having favorability towards Glenn is one thing he continued why is there a part of me in this wait in the summary of the Fallen Valkyrie account there's a line that reads fallen from Grace after falling in love with the Mortal this Mortal couldn't possibly be mean right Yu suddenly linked this to the systems note the valkyrie fell into chaos because of her love for a moral then driven mad by the death of her beloved eventually became tained by the evil from the cosmos transforming into a manifestation of Slaughter destroying everything he wondered could it be that I came to this world to break this ending yet now I have become the unwitting participant for her sake Marilyn must AB absolutely not fall in love with me ywu silently wished I hope I am not the one mentioned in that summary in front of him the vast mountain range revealed a village in the distance A procession was moving along the narrow path through the canyon towards that Village The Village Chief in the procession announced ahead is our destination fortunately mayor Melvin has agreed to take in our refugees otherwise because of the Demonic Beast attack that delayed Maryland's Valkyrie selection this year I really don't know what we would do Marilyn replied don't say that Village Chief the matters of the village are more important than my selection if I can't protect everyone well what significance does it have even if I become the valkyrie The Village Chief was moved praising this child is always so kind-hearted Marilyn looked at y wo smiling and asked speaking of which Caitlyn also wants to participate in the selection this year right I wonder if her swordsmanship has improved compared to before ye move asked in confusion who is Caitlyn Marilyn explained she is my best friend and the daughter of Mayor Melvin we have grown up playing together and now we have become Rivals because only one person is qualified to become the valkyrie that's why Marilyn excitedly stood up looked at Yu and said please teach me how to become stronger because you are so powerful you must have your own methods I beg you yo yiu smiled awkwardly politely declined oh actually my way of becoming strong is very special in this world apart from me there probably isn't anyone who can use it or teach you I'm sorry Marilyn looked at him with a regretful face and said oh I i' see well regardless thank you for saving me I won't forget this kindness above her head a notification appeared loyalty decreased by 10% yiwu's loyalty is 20% yiu smiled and thought to himself oh the loyal has finally decreased I must Matchmaker Marilyn and Glenn to break this situation if she falls in love with me wouldn't everything be in vain the wheel rolled to a stop someone announced sheath we have arrived at the Village Gate mayor Kelvin and Caitlyn were waiting to greet them the status board displayed Kelvin level 60 Caitlyn level 80 the members of the group exclaimed in Surprise oh it's mayor Kelvin he personally came to welcome us and there's k Caitlyn too the chief stepped forward to shake hands greet the mayor and expressed mayor Kelvin thank you for agreeing to take in the people from our village I will remember your great kindness in my heart the mayor cheerfully replied you're being too kind haha we've been old friends for many years and you're in trouble how could I just stand by Caitlyn morly held Marilyn's hand and asked sha Marilyn what happened to you why are there so many wounds on your body Marilyn smiled and replied it's nothing just minor injuries let me tell you Marilyn recounted what had happened to Caitlyn saying here's how it went Marilyn hugged Yu's arm excitedly introducing see he saved me he's incredibly powerful with one move he defeated a level 120 mountain monster upon hearing this Caitlyn felt grateful and bowed her head to greet and thank Yu saying hello thank you for saving my best friend yiu smiled and replied no need to thank me I'm just doing what I should do Caitlyn looked at him and said firmly Marilyn and I are like sisters you saving her is equivalent to saving me I will never forget this kindness suddenly a warning from the system appeared Master this woman has issues don't be deceived by her seemingly docile and understanding nature the dark purple Phantom indicates that she is not only Wicked but also has a strong sense of vigilance towards you youu thought it doesn't matter she's just someone I met once as long as her feelings for Marilyn are genuine that's enough mayor Kelvin with a troubled expression approached gu wo and said I have heard the stories of your presence I appreciate your protection but the traditions of the town do not welcome Outsiders to avoid causing further trouble for the residents you can only stay here for one night at most tomorrow morning you must leave the village Chief standing beside him also said I'm sorry y wo y Wu smiled waved his hand in response it's all right Chief I didn't plan to stay here for long anyway if you are safe to your destination then I will take my leave suddenly a voice shouted no Marilyn rushed over grabbing Yu's hand her eyes sparkling as she looked at him and said you have helped us with such great things you can't just leave like this at least stay tonight for the feast and leave tomorrow she pleaded stay Stay Stay Yu's face showed a struggle and he finally agreed all right fine he thought to himself this personality is indeed not easy to deal with under the full moon a feast was taking place many people gathered around the pig being roasted over the fire raising their glasses and cheering toasting one another y Wu lay in the room his hands behind his head deep in thought the taste of food in a foreign land is not bad but I still long for Mio Ba's culinary skills more tomorrow I will set off to search for The Treasure of Asgard the realm of the Gods first over at marylands they're making a stealth drone to monitor the development of the timeline before waiting for a new situation to intervene a knock on the door sounded y woo opened the door and replied come in he wondered hauh everyone is drinking now why would anyone come looking for me as soon as he opened the door Caitlyn suddenly rushed in hugging ye woo tightly startling him and making him ask Caitlyn what do you want to do catlyn her face flushed from the alcohol shut the door and looked at him asking what do you think we could do in a quiet room late at night just a man and a woman he replied Miss Caitlyn you're drunk Caitlyn placed her hand on his chest speaking in a seductive tone no way I'm very sober I'm saying I will never forget the kindness you've shown me so isn't it time to repay that kindness ye's ression darkened in silence and the systems robot displayed a warning Master be careful she wants to eat you y wo was pushed down onto the bed and Caitlyn sat on top of him he teasingly asked her oh is this how people in your place repay others with such enthusiasm she replied well it depends on who the other person is if it's a handsome and strong man like you Caitlyn leaned her face close to him and continued I'd be begging for it she pulled out a knife and lunged at him stabbing repeatedly her face turned wicked as she broke into a Sinister smile and shouted die die die die she wore a cruel smile her eyes wide open as she asked why are you so close to Marilyn go die Yu's voice came from behind her questioning you still say you aren't drunk the room was filled with pillows flying everywhere Caitlyn turned her head her face panicked and saw him sitting on a chair legs crossed smiling as he asked her why are you stabbing randomly at my pillows you said you were repaying me but instead you won't let me sleep peacefully what's your purpose Miss Caitlyn she shouted how can you Caitlyn stood with her back to him frowning her eyes glaring menacingly she laughed loudly and said haha truly worthy of being the man that Marilyn has her eye on but the more so the more I want to ensure she doesn't get you based on what Caitlyn lunged forward with a knife her eyes filled with furious rage shouting based on what that Marilyn is the center of attention wherever she goes like the sun making everyone like her and I can only be the cold Moon forever revealing a similar side hiding in the shadows as a backdrop for her therefore I must take away what she loves so she can taste the flavor of pain Yi Wu quickly grabbed Caitlyn's hands looking at her and saying Marilyn sees you as her best sister and you treat her like this for now I will consider your earlier Behavior as jealousy and resentment of a girl he tightly held her wrist making the knife fall glaring angrily and saying you can vent your emotions on me but if you dare to lay a hand on Marilyn I'm afraid you won't live to see the day you become the valkyrie Caitlyn shouted you ye W thought although it is said that the growth of anyone is not a smooth sailing facing a dark-hearted best friend like this Marilyn's path to becoming the valkyrie is still very long Yu spoke to her in a calm tone go to sleep you're really drunk I hope that when you wake up tomorrow you'll forget everything that happened tonight as soon as he finished speaking he struck her at the back of the neck Caitlyn let out a cry her eyes rolling back as she became unconscious Marilyn who was drunk and holding two glasses of wheat smoothies kicked the door open and laughed loudly asking vwoo why are you going to sleep so early get up and drink more I haven't had enough yet Marilyn looked up and saw yiu holding the unconscious Caitlyn her face instantly turned tense as she asked why wo what are you and Caitlyn doing y wo exclaimed in a panic oh my God Marilyn was so embarrassed that she stammered this that you too I then quickly turning around she said sorry to disturb you too I'll step out right away Yu was frightened that she might misunderstand so he hurriedly called out what are you thinking come back here after explaining she calmed down a bit and replied so it's because Caitlyn came specifically to thank you then she drank too much and forgot to go home H that really startled me he asked in fear if not what do you think it is she ignored him and changed the subject because Caitlyn doesn't have a good tolerance for alcohol she rarely drinks on ordinary days and today she only had a few extra drinks out of Joy I really have no choice with her hearing this he thought to himself not telling her the truth is also to protect the Purity in her heart even if this relationship will eventually be broken it should not be due to mind doing a few minutes later she despite him said at the party let's keep drinking I see you've only had half a drink and lost your spirit so I came to find you we haven't won that drinking contest yet ye will immediately refuse oh I really can't drink anymore Marilyn shook her head and said it's okay you just need to cheer me on watch me drink until everyone else passes out just as they were about to leave a shadow appeared behind the house that shadow stood in front of the house Kelvin opened the door and silently cursed y woo what a useless man just for this small matter he nearly ruined all my plans seeing the defeated look on my daughter's face makes me feel so frustrated in this pathetic state how can I trust him with the plan the next morning everyone gathered to bid him farewell so you must take your leave now the village Chief spoke differently from his demeanor the previous night this time Kelvin feeling disappointed said with your abilities we are no longer worried May the light of we your humble servants illuminate the path before you Caitlyn bowed and said take care we did not host you well I hope for your forgiveness The Village Chief continued we cannot keep you any longer I sincerely apologize it is just that the tradition of the town cannot be broken the hospitality of the locals made him shake his head politely no not at all I have been the inconvenience I viz floated beside him and warned this mayor has problems don't be fooled by appearances he is smiling cheerfully but the spectrum is black indicating he is scheming something in his heart he transmitted I know keep observing just as he was about to leave Marilyn suddenly appeared embracing him tightly I will definitely not forget you ye woo in just 10 days it will be the valkyrie selection day you must come to see me he nodded of course I will come just for that simple promise his favorability towards ye woo increased by 35% after saying goodbye to everyone he took off leaving the villagers astonished look there that young man has wings no way could he really be a God can we just chase a God out of the Town only Marilyn was not surprised at all she watched his figure disappear and softly said yay woo you must come visit me again while flying yiu couldn't help but think that hug just now increased my favorability once again if I keep getting closer to her won't my favorability keep Rising endlessly standing in front of the God's Castle Yu commanded the system activate the time manipulation skill I want to see how the timeline of this world will develop if I don't get close to Marilyn what will be her final fate the system immediately responded time manipulation ability granted there are several types of acceleration forward or backward please choose host on the screen the choices appeared one by one speed 10 speed 50 speed 100 without hesitation yiu chos immediately speed 100 quickly fast forward through a cycle of Marilyn's fate and this world meanwhile record important Milestone events and finally before the world is destroyed destroyed I will rewind time back to the current point the time wheel began to shift and at that moment a response echoed initiating time acceleration at 100 times important event number one the time runs to the selection ceremony of The Valkyrie a voice resounded from the stage welcome to the venue of the valkyrie selection held once every 10 years in Asgard Realm of the Gods Aaron jars after the thrilling duel round just now we would like to congratulate the winner Marilyn although there were some minor issues during the competition in the end the winner is the valkyrie candidate Marilyn she has officially secured her place in the next training round let's look forward to her exciting performances Marilyn breathed heavily her heart filled with emotions she softly said to remind herself I won I won do you see that ywo but when she looked up to the stands disappointment flooded her mind the person she secretly admired Yu was not present this made think Li woo why can't I see you did you not come to watch me compete you promised you would come why is this happening did you lie to me Marilyn tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword her brows furrowed a mix of sadness and disappointment nonetheless in her heart her feelings for yi Wu remained unchanged even deepening her favorability towards Yi Wu increased by 40% notification system continue with the second important event the Wilder Ena quickly transformed replaced by the image of a Giant Mountain the screams echoed Marilyn hold on even though we don't have any healing potions the final boss is almost dead give it you all one last time to kill it she replied got it Catalina a loud scream rang out die immediately the frost giant Was Defeated however the condition of both was not promising thinking everything had come to an end Marilyn turned to celebrate with Catalina we we killed the boss just as the smile on her face was about to last a blade pierced straight through her body Catalina coldly said her farewell this is the final goodbye even in a critical State Marilyn struggled Das why why do this Catalina lowered her head helplessly answering have you forgotten the winner of the final trial must be the sole survivor killing the boss and reaching the end point to obtain the stone of covant for the honor of the city and to fulfill my father's plan I have no other choice she paused for a moment and continued what I bear is different from what you carry Marilyn but I cannot bring myself to kill you with my own hands I will just leave you here to await your death Catalina turned away but did not forget to emphasize still our 10-year bond is real Catalina's Hasty explanation tightened Marilyn's heart she choked on her words and question I'm asking you why do this you're all I have left why do you have to betray me to in despair humans often struggle Marilyn was no exception she poured her strength into a violent strike screaming in pain what did I do wrong why does everyone have to abandon me before being split in two Catalina could only utter one last question why do you still possess such great power silence engulfed the space despair consumed Marilyn's mind even as the Victor her heart had suffered too much it cried out in pain and longing for for compassion where are you y wo in her weakest moment her affection toward y wo increased by 45% system notification important event number three Marilyn descended from above her Enormous Wings glowing Glenn's resonant voice continued to announce I am here bearing the command from the Divine the ultimate Victor of this selection contest is Marilyn she's granted high level divine power and the title of Valkyrie blow every everyone cheered joyfully oh Divine being the Divine decree has finally been issued Marilyn she has done it the compliments continued Valkyrie Marilyn Valkyrie Marilyn however her expressionless face left everyone wondering Marilyn doesn't look very happy her eyes are blank as if something has happened time went on after becoming a valkyrie Marilyn gradually lost her smile and the vibrant spirit that once Shone like the sun she buried all her feelings deep inside wholeheartedly following Glenn the main God fighting tirelessly against the monsters and Giants at the front lines when she struck the arm of a monster it let out a howling scream of pain then furiously stood up it raised the staff in its hand and shouted loudly you bastards have slaughtered my kin I want your life Marilyn was startled and before she could react Glenn rushed in he effortlessly shattered the monster's body with one hand then turned his head to her looking at her her with a cold gaze don't be careless Marilyn hearing this she lowered her head and softly replied I understand Glen the system continued to recount the two of them relentlessly charged forward winning battles where they fought it was Glenn's kindness and extraordinary strength that gradually opened the door to Marilyn's heart which seemed to have been closed off as time passed the wheel of fate rolled to another important event standing outside on the balcony the two exchanged Laing glances feel seemingly conveyed through a tender handhold Glenn spoke up first beautiful Valkyrie Marilyn would you be willing to become my love Marilyn was a bit taken aback so she exclaimed a little louder what what did you say he took her hand and placed it on his chest smiling as he said beneath your cold expression like snow there actually hides a pure kindness like a lily along with the sunshine and enthusiasm like a magnificent Rose your figure has long been deeply imprinted in my soul the nights without you leave me tossing and turning and tonight I finally have the resolve to let the Stars witness this the moon bears witness will you accept my request she hesitated a bit not looking him in the eye and replied ah about that I'm just not prepared yet hearing her say that he continued actually I know there is always one person in your heart Glenn smiled and added time keeps passing yet your heart remains in the same place but no matter the reason reason that man has ultimately betrayed your feelings must you wake wholeheartedly for him it's time to let go of the past Marilyn's eyes filled with tears struggling to say Glenn I he boldly stepped forward kissed her lips and whispered I love you Marilyn please accept me she L her tears flow down her cheeks as she embraced him the timeline begins to move again after determining each other's intentions the feelings between the two quickly deepened and their cooperation on the back Battlefield became even more intimate however the main God has followed a strict rule for countless years to ensure pure Bloodlines gods are not allowed to love morals even though Marilyn has become a valkyrie she is still forbidden to love so the two can only secretly maintain this relationship in Silence the fifth important event occurs Glenn is being Shackled and tortured in agony screaming loudly a God standing nearby looks down and says the main god actually loves aortal disregarding the law with no shame from now on imprison Glenn in the celestial dungeon apply torture and strip Marilyn of her divine power and status as a valkyrie after being expelled from the Holy Temple Marilyn wants to rush up to save him but is blocked struggling and shouting his name Glenn after she is expelled from the Holy Temple because her beloved is still desperately bangning on the door shouting open the door give Glenn back to me mar maroine has been stripped of her divine power and expelled from the Holy Temple all her lifelong efforts suddenly crumble into nothing and she cannot even keep the one she loves she slumps down in front of the Holy Temple tears streaming down her face crying and screaming I've already lost y wo I can't lose Glenn too quickly return him Marilyn in a frenzy stood up and pushed the door which burst open she yelled loudly give it back to me she stepped in with a new armor filled with killing int tent in a state of extreme sorrow a mysterious power within Marilyn was activated this power was so immense that it surpassed even the divine power of The Valkyrie she once possessed significant event number six took place at this moment she had rescued Glenn and was fleeing with him Marilyn reversed back to the Holy Temple to save the one she loved initially believing she could Escape but nonetheless a tragic fate awaited her she had never stopped four gods appeared looked at her and said who are you clearly I have taken your divine power why can you still grow stronger you are not a being of the realm of Salvation what exactly are you Glenn supported by her tired but still spoke father of the Gods I am willing to renounce my Divine body and become immortal I only ask that you can forgive us and grant us freedom for our years of Brave fighting the gods were Furious threw their swords towards the two and screamed damn it the law is the law it cannot be bargained if you love each other so much then that will change the way of payment for you Glenn saw this and rushed to block a blow for her shouting Marilyn carefully crying loudly rushed to call his name Glenn covered in blood painfully said I'm sorry Marilyn he raised his hand to wipe her tears continuing I never expected my love would bring you such a tragic ending but have no regrets if given another chance I would still choose to love you as soon as he finished speaking he closed his eyes and lay still her tears flowed down as she was in shock unable to believe her eyes Marilyn cried out in pain no immediately a bolt of lightning erupted from her shooting straight up to the sky the gods saw this and shouted what is that the sky is cracking from the crack a strange entity appeared saying your power can open a pathway to remove those who affirm tragedy her pain and sorrow had taken it all the gods terrified asked what on Earth is that the system continued to narrate the mysterious power of Marilyn opens the link to the evil power of the cosmic Abyss while being tainted by evil she has gained immense power that strange power began to merge into her Marilyn shouted in Anger Glenn what meaning is there in this world without you event number seven the final sword fight the main god of dusk appeared from the sky leaving behind a destructive streak that annihilated everything Marilyn commanded the destruction of everything you also said come here it ends the moment of time rewound to the original point and the system quickly responded to his words receiving the moment of time that was reversing the threat of time returned to the starting point he gasped for breath slammed his fist down on the ground and shouted damn it I didn't expect my appearance and disappearance to bring such great suffering to Marilyn even the main god Glenn couldn't give her a happy ending why in this world is there a law prohibiting Gods from loving each other he frowned thinking to himself to untie the Bell you need someone to tie it others can't rely on It ultimately it needs me to break this cycle although this mission is more complicated than I thought if I must do it no matter what happens to the world I will ensure Marilyn's happiness and welcome the final conclusion Kelvin spoke up wishing you to the Valkyrie trial may you win tomorrow everyone raise your glasses and toast Marilyn placed her hand on Catalina's shoulder and smiled haha so happy Catalina although my uncle and I are best friends in the official competition I won't hold back Catalina replied of course I will give my all not to lose to you suddenly Marilyn clutched her mouth feeling nauseous she exclaimed and her father worriedly asked Marilyn what's wrong with you her face was flushed from drinking Marilyn hesitantly replied I probably drank too much earlier and plus I've had some minor issues with my body these past few days but I'm fine haha how can I still be laughing tomorrow is the trial and my health absolutely must not have any issues after saying this both she and her father stood up to head out then turned to smile at the mayor sorry mayor I think we will leave after tonight I'll take Marilyn home to rest he said it's okay you two go on a moment later the mayor's face was full of malice he chuckled to himself haha go ahead and sleep my plan is about to succeed the next day at the arena where the trials took place a voice announced this trial will use a point system each contestant needs to undergo five trial rounds winning a round will earn two points losing will deduct one point and if there is a draw each participant will receive one point contestants with points in the top 20 will enter the finals tomorrow I hereby declare the competition officially begins as soon as she finished peing everyone around began to cheer finally the once a decade competition was starting the first match was between Audrey level 81 and Marilyn level 80 Audrey slashed at Marilyn and said you were the most highly rated contestant in this trial this is the result she had a bit of difficulty blocking a strike from Audrey she had a stumble back Marilyn knelt down panting and thought damn it my body feels heavier and heavier I can't exert my strength at all what's going on Marilyn's father washing from the stands was deeply worried something's wrong with Marilyn's body this is not her usual strength what's happening mayor Kelvin spoke up this is not good if it continues like this but deep down he was quite pleased thinking of himself she's definitely going to lose haha Andrey knocked her away and said it's over Marilyn stabbed her sword into the ground determined not to give up I absolutely cannot give up I showed exceptional performance before if I lose this round I won't even make it into the top 20 I'll be eliminated her expression became Resolute then she jumped up moved closer to Audrey and raised her fist I will absolutely not allow this to happen Audrey was hit repeatedly by her opponent and unexpectedly said how can this be her strength suddenly increased Mar replied 10 years of effort just for today I absolutely cannot lose after that Marilyn claimed Victory Audrey exhausted fell to the ground the announcement rang out the life indicator of contestant Audrey is below 5% the training session is terminated the winner of this round is Marilyn she achieved a record of three months with two ties ranking 20th and earned qualification for the final showdown those around were cheering joyfully we've won finally passed the test y Wu also came to watch standing in the stands clapping and praising well done Marilyn she looked at him happily thinking vwoo he kept his promise to come watch my competition that's great that's great I hope my performance didn't disappoint him as she thought this she raised her hand to wave at him after the competition mayor Kelvin was Furious called his daughter and scolded you have disappointed me greatly this dog I told you to poison Marilyn yet you voluntarily reduced the dosage and now what is the result she still made it to the final showdown all my efforts to build this plan weren't in vain Catalina replied the amount of poison you gave is too much I just wanted her to lose but I didn't mean to kill her he kicked her and shouted The Compassion of women what I want is for her to be accidentally killed in the trials only then can you become a valkyrie and I as your biological father can qualify for the finals too this is my lifelong wish Catalina endured the pain forced herself to rise and looked at her father even without using such underhanded tactics I can still beat her can't you see that I won five matches today ranked first while she is only in 20th Place mayor Kelvin scoffed does this ranking mean anything tried counting with your fingers since we were young how many times have you won against her don't underestimate the gap between the two of you regardless of technique or practical experience she is far stronger than you to make you a valkyrie I have spared no effort first I sent people to lure a monster to their Village forcing the entire Village to leave after that I pretended to accept them making it easy for Marilyn to fall into my trap she would never suspect her best friend would poison her and yet now because of a trivial matter of Pride you have caused everything to fall apart truly the foolishness of women after saying that he B down to touch her head sighed my child now bringing this up is too late but tomorrow is the last opportunity you must seize this chance just think as long as you become a valkyrie accepting to bestow blessings on the main God would you have to worry about aelan anymore think for yourself Catalina softly replied I understand after that she stepped outside at that moment a voice came from behind so it turns out everything is a scheme of yours that foolish melan girl navely sees you as a sister not knowing that she has already been sold Catalina turned back glancing at ywo standing behind if you already know are you planning to tell her or kill me right here y wo answered I will do neither she is stronger than you think if she always has to rely on others to deal with schemes and dangers she will never become a true strongman Catalina asked why you care about malan so much you two just met a few days ago you replied with a question compared to malan shouldn't you care more about your own situation are you truly willing to live your whole life under your father's control if so what meaning is there in becoming a valkyrie he said seriously think carefully before making a decision tomorrow will be the day that determines your future fate Catalina felt a bit sad she replied my matters do not need your reminder the next day Glenn stepped out from the portal and spoke ladies welcome to the final trial I will explain the rules of this trial clearly another contestant looked at him and exclaimed look it's Glenn he's so handsome Glenn continued to announce you 20 ladies need to go into the secluded Valley ahead find and defeat the frost giant ultimately the mission is to obtain the stone of Covenant however there is only one piece of the stone of Covenant whoever gets it first will be the winner of the final trial he emphasized with a serious expression I must remind you the level of danger in this trial is completely different from before once you enter the secret realm there will be no way out until the trial ends whether you live or die it all depends on your abilities if anyone is still worried it's not too late to withdraw right now Marilyn thought to herself thank goodness for yiwu's medicine my body has not only fully recovered but is even in a state that exceeds before this feeling of security has never been experienced before she stepped for forward saying seriously please start the trial quickly Glenn nodded slightly and replied Valkyrie I am already prepared a moment later from the stands a voice sighed they have been in there for a long time I wonder what is happening inside mayor Kelvin stood next to him his face showing obvious worry he said I heard that in the trial 10 years ago apart from the final winner no one among the participant returned alive Marilyn's father sighed Softly I hope both Marilyn and Catalina come back safely even if they do not become Valkyries it is fine as long as they survive hearing this mayor Kelvin grew angry and shouted how can you so easily dismiss their efforts becoming a valkyrie is their belief and ideal all along they have already attained the awareness of sacrifice what you say is nothing but an insult to their determination Catalina's father retorted his voice equally heeded but Catalina is your own daughter if she dies you not regret it kelvin's voice deepened Resolute Catalina will not die I have always believed she will win yet despite saying this his expression darkened deep down he thought if Catalina had obediently followed my plan everything would have been decided long ago I wouldn't have to worry as I do now however he could not deny one fact Marilyn and Catalina were the strongest among the 20 participants the others were completely inconsequential when the final trial began space was was completely sealed those outside could not see what was happening inside but could only wait for the results therefore Catalina's mission was to defeat Marilyn to win her father Stood Beside her and said good daughter this is the last opportunity all mine glory and wealth depend on you suddenly yiu appeared beneath the arena he spoke loudly excuse me may I ask a question can the process of the final trial be shown to everyone or do we all just sit and wait in despair murmurs began to rise around him a person standing nearby sneered who are you your identity is not enough to approach this trial platform step down Glenn the supervisor of the trial spoke up to reassure it's okay he then turned to Yu and explained it seems you come from another world so you understand our Traditions the world within this trial's boundary belongs to a different dimension the barrier between Dimensions prevents all even Gods using allseeing glass it's not that we don't want to display it it's that we cannot yiu smiled and replied I see but what if I say that I have a way to accomplish it may I have a chance to try in his mind he silently thought it seems that this world has developed magic too much and has overlooked technological science the so-called allseen glass sounds like a highlevel magical product perhaps I will have the opportunity to learn more as soon as he finished speaking the audience in the stands began began to stir leading the charge was mayor Kelvin he scoffed and said what kind of joke is this even I couldn't accomplish such a feet how could you possibly do it get out of here after that Marilyn's father and the villagers couldn't stop discussing this is something even the gods would find difficult y woo Who are you are you a god from another realm another person spoke up that's right didn't you see his wings those could be divine Wings something only a true deity could possess Glenn looked at him thinking and murmuring to himself those are indeed Divine wings but why can't I sense any divine power from him is he deliberately concealing it this person is not simple at all then Glenn said loudly if you're that confident let's see you try yiu replied succinctly all right he shouted go transmit the images from the training secret realm back here as soon as he finished speaking dozens of flying camera robots Rose up and responded in unison at your command master the images were transmitted it was a mountain with a small crevice in the middle a greenish light emanated from the crevice all captured clearly by the robots the crowd gasped so this is what the training secret realm looks like he's really done it incredible I can't believe this is real around them the cheers echoed endlessly how could he possibly achieve this he spoke up science Technology and Engineering are heavy matters nothing to be surprised about mayor Kelvin this time you can finally see your daughter bravely fighting the enemy are you happy Mr Kelvin felt a bit tense responding happy what kind of happy is that I'm worried to death de he thought to himself it's over if this image truly appears in the realm of Secrets my plan is ruined the robot continued to display images from within a gloomy scene emerged red as Blood on the ground the bodies of the contestants lay scattered someone in the crowd shouted look over there isn't this really a trial how could it be so brutal another person yelled trembling no that that's my daughter oh no she's dead Hulu a woman burst into tears sobbing Sister Sister we thought it was just a trial how could it be this cruel she turned to Lord Glenn questioning why is this trial so Merc if it weren't for that brother intervening we would have been kept in the dark had I known it would be like this I wouldn't have let my daughter participate Glenn silently looked at the crowd after a moment he spoke up his voice Resolute do you think that you live in peace without knowing where it comes from it's thanks to us those on the battlefield risking Our Lives to kill the enemy that you can have such peace the real Battlefield is a thousand times more brutal than this trial if you fear a strong enemy in death how can you become a valkyrie leading to Victory on the battlefield the crowd fell silent no one daring to say another word Glenn frowned thinking to himself the words are like that but the state of the trial this time is beyond my expectations has the pollution level gotten worse already just then someone exclaimed look over there Marilyn and Catalina had teamed up to defeat the final boss one person exclaimed in Surprise oh my those two are incredible a valkyrie is supposed to be one but now they are both killing the boss together how should this be accounted for Before Their Eyes was the scene of Marilyn and Catalina working together to take down the boss mayor Kelvin quietly rejoiced well done my daughter just one last step kill Marilyn and you will become the valkyrie even if everyone sees it it doesn't matter because the rules don't forbid sneak attacks he in another Corner Yu silently thought the moment of Destiny has arrived Marilyn was sitting on the ground picking up Treasures she murmured this boss was really tough to deal with let's see if it has any treasures at that moment Catalina stood behind her looking at her helplessly Catalina suddenly raised her sword blocking a monster that was about to attack Marilyn Catalina sternly reminded Marilyn you were being too careless don't just focus on picking up equipment while ignoring the danger behind you hearing that Marilyn turned around slightly flustered but Catalina immediately pointed her sword at her speaking with eyes full of determination now it's just the two of us but there can only be one Valkyrie come on let's have a duel this time I absolutely will not lose to you Marilyn stood up and replied of course I've been prepared for a long time little cina a villager spoke up indeed it must be a duel to determine the winner at least it doesn't have to end in death another person commented this little girl is truly remark able I thought she would take a different approach mayor Kelvin trembled and asked why why then he shouted why didn't you follow my instructions just one stab from behind would be enough what Fair duel are you talking about do you think you can defeat Marilyn in a direct match Catalina heard this and lowered her head without responding Marilyn's father standing nearby anxiously asked mayor Kelvin what did you just say are you suggesting Catalina should ambush my daughter Kelvin was startled and realized he had misspoken quickly backpedaling uh no that's not it I was just joking I'm the mayor how could I do something like that Marilyn's father firmly rebutted joking but clearly everyone here heard what you said mayor y Wu also spoke up we all saw clearly now you can't pretend anymore can you Kelvin Kelvin fumbled unable to say anything further the crowd became Restless their eyes fixed on him filled with suspicion and anger Kevin Furious stood up pointing at him and shouted loudly what nonsense are you talking about don't make up stories to slander me Glenn quickly capture this guy as soon as he finished speaking the robot immediately projected an image of him slapping his daughter and scolding her the day before in the video he said I'm so disappointed this worthless being Kevin couldn't believe these images were real he sneered and asked have you forgotten what happened last night so quickly then the video played a scene of Kevin kicking his daughter he held his head and screamed in despair don't show anymore the images continued to replay his words from the day before to make you a valkyrie I spared no effort first I sent people to lure monsters to their Village forcing the entire Village to leave after that I pretended to take them in so Marilyn could easily act in front of me she would never suspect that you her best friend were the one who poisoned her but tomorrow is the last opportunity you must seize it think about it as long as you become a valkyrie and accept to bestow blessings on the main god why would you care about a Marilyn think for yourself mayor Kevin screamed and panicked I'm telling you to stop turn it off turn it off right now y Wu said your daughter has her own life don't fantasize about controlling her entire life I hate the most when others use familial ties to threaten what is the Taste when a scheme is publicly exposed and punished the villagers in Maryland questioned him how could this be I thought you had the kindness to take us in I didn't expect you to be so cruel and malicious everyone has been deceived by this hypocrite this man is nothing but an immoral Tyrant how can such a person be allowed to be mayor drive him out get out Kelvin still insisted you can say I'm cruel malicious or that I disregard everything for victory but what's wrong with that there's no rule that forbids backstabbing or scheming so I haven't done anything wrong Glenn said coldly although it doesn't explicitly prohibit I absolutely do not acknowledge such ruthless tactics no one wants to be on a battlefield and have to turn their back to someone who stabbed their teammates in the back guards I am imprisoning him in the dungeon for violating the code you wanted to go to the Golden City right now I will fulfill that dream for you the soldiers followed the order mayor Kelvin was dragged out by Two Soldiers he screamed for mercy no I was wrong please for the sake of my daughter forgive me Glenn looked at Yu smiled and said thank you ye woo your righteousness and divine power impress me if you can't lend us your strength it would be a Pity I will definitely recommend you to the god Chi parent so that you can have the qualifications to enter the Golden City yiu replied I am truly honored he thought to himself this result is not bad entering the Golden City of course I must go to the Divine treasury to have a look at this moment a panicked voice exclaimed it's bad everyone look how can there be an even more powerful boss appearing in this trial what is going on from the space portal a gigantic boss entirely may have ice emerged it emitted a heavy voice after such a difficult effort to open a teleportation door I ended up being s to a place like this Marilyn and Catalina were both astonished at its appearance it was the frost giant hammer level 180 it sneered coldly and said Valkyrie in reserve huh forget it if you want to destroy the base of the main God you must annihilate the future first are you too ready to die get ready Frost giant hammer Furious W Havoc around and growled is this really the future Valkyrie you're too weak how could Glenn Poss train you it's truly a waste of my expectations the formidable power of the monster made Catalina feel fearful she frowned her voice trembling the Gap in strength is too vast why do Secret Realms trials have to summon monsters like this Marilyn could not hide her anxiety replying we've already taken all the medicine that youw provided this time there really is no way back the monster roared its voice full of Menace go ahead and kill me you are all so so dull if you have any last words say them quickly it would be best if you cried and screamed in pain so I can enjoy your suffering suddenly it shouted starting with you right after that the monster swung its sword stabbing through cen's shoulder she screamed in agony uh Marilyn seeing this was terrified and rushed towards her shouting Catalina Catalina gritted her teeth stopping Marilyn don't come over here Marilyn if there are truly last words to say I actually have something to tell you I don't want to take these words to the Grave she suppressed her pain each word escaping with difficulty The Villages of your people were forced to relocate it was because my father sent people to lure the monster here he wanted you to come to our town to make it easier for him to deal with you she paused for a moment her breathing heavy then continued a few days ago your body wasn't unwell because you were sick but because I poison the wine even just now when you had your back to me I contemplated stabbing you from behind to claim victory in this trial Marin could not believe what she had just heard she asked again you what are you saying Catalina are you lying to me haven't we been good sisters growing up together since we were little Catalina sadly confessed it's because I've both liked and hated you clearly I'm not inferior to you in any way but in everyone's eyes there's only you that's why I have always wanted to win against you fairly rather than through underhanded means it's just a Pity that now there's no longer any opportunity for that seeing that scene Hammer angrily shouted what are you two doing I gave you time to express your sorrow and lament as a result you're putting on this awkward emotional display for me after saying that hammer mercilessly kicked Catalina causing her to crash painfully through the ice barrier suddenly Marilyn with her sword in hand rushed towards him threatening stop Hammer remained calm and asked but then thinking it over wouldn't it be more interesting to let the two Reserve Valkyries fight to the death after finishing his sentence he only needed one punch to send Marilyn flying backwards Hammer coldly said if you want to have a direct confrontation then I'll give you that opportunity Glenn woke up and said as long as you please me the one who wins might just be spared by me he laughed loudly full of arrogance horen was has taken a back and replied haha their lives and deaths are not for you to decide suddenly a brilliant Golden Light appeared shattering the layer of frost surrounding Herm he exclaimed in astonishment the light Glenn on the other side Yi wo spread his wings wide and swooped down to save Marilyn she was surprised L woo he reassured her don't worry it's all right now Marilyn jumped up full of indignation all right how can it be all right I almost got sliced into five pieces y Wu chuckled lightly hey but immediately afterward his expression became serious y Wu shouted angrily do you think that was enough to kill me do you think I came here unprepared and dared to barge in with the support of this secret weapon I want you dead seeing his Fury erupt ye move anxiously thought this evil corrupt Aura is exactly like the pollutants from the deep space before if that's the case then this must definitely be related to the issue of causality did the pollutants invade this world through that Rift as cause or as effect Glenn was astonished and asked the mysterious power that was investigated in the previous reports it even managed to pollute your kind he replied pollution no no no that is the Supreme blessing with this blessing no matter how fast your sword may be you cannot kill me Glenn Glenn raised his bow and answered if that's the case then all I need to do is make sure you can't reorganize youu stood by secretly speculating level 270 that's impressive no wonder I haven't seen his status until now it turns out he was intentionally hiding it now his real health bar is showing Arrow after Arrow struck its body Hammer screamed in pain youa do you intend to pin me here forever useless as long as you cannot completely destroy me I will will keep reincarnating and fusing aha suddenly Yi Wu created a purple array surrounding its body he said his voice calm so it seems the law of villains die from excessive talking applies universally to every World it screamed in Anger you what are you doing even the gods cannot kill me you are just a small human how can you do anything to me Yu stood still smiling of course I'm going to use my passion to melt your icy heart melt in the literal sense unable to accept he exclaimed impossible stubbornly he continued I have the backing of the blessing team how could I lose to a mere human the system announced kill the frost giant boss gain 1 million experience points acquired the heart of the frost giant an epic grade primitive material after use gained the power of the frost giant enhancing ice attribute abilities Yu's eyes lit up he thought to himself although this Primal resource might not benefit me it seems to have effects on Kulu I wonder if she will clear more than two billion of my debts over here Marilyn proudly said incredible whether it's Glenn or Y woo you both are amazing Catalina was taken a back she thought I can't believe y wo Has the strength comparable to the main god Glenn clearly he could easily kill me yet he gave me a chance to turn things around she approached and praised guwu you are truly impressive not only do you possess exceptional skills but your combat strength is also formidable this is the first time I have met such a strong mortal like you once I return to the Golden City I will definitely recommend you to the ranks of the Gods ye woo humbly replied oh it's just okay my fire attribute ability just happens to counter the ice attribute he worriedly thought if I can enter the main god in the Golden City it would be best but the main god like Glenn has already reached level two 270 not to mention the level of their father with my current strength I cannot confront him the next step I should take is to enter the Golden City clarify the specific situation and then decide on a countermeasure ye wo instructed the two girls I have seen everything you both fought very valiantly and logically you both deserve the honor of promotion however Catalina and her father have committed a series of illegal acts in the selection competition by rights they deserve punishment therefore it is a balance of merits and demerits although they will not face additional penalties Catalina's qualification to be promoted to Valkyrie has been revoked Marilyn asked in confusion why is that Catalina she was just Catalina interrupted gently Marilyn you don't need to say anymore this is the outcome I deserve in fact compared to what I have done this outcome is a great Mercy my situation is not important right now the most important thing is C Alina approached to HUB Marilyn joyfully saying congratulations on becoming a valkyrie Marilyn smiled in response thank you Catalina Glenn stood up and announced I would like to declare that the winner of this Valkyrie selection contest is Marilyn the crowd cheered excitedly ha Marilyn did it she really succeeded Glenn looked toward Marilyn and continued before the ceremony begins I still have one question to ask you he held the Divine sword seriously asking becoming a valkyrie is just the beginning ahead of you will be dangerous battlefields and life and death confrontations day in night despite that do you still wish to become a valkyrie Marilyn confidently replied of course I am willing becoming a valkyrie is my greatest dream no matter how many difficulties lie ahead I will bravely move forward and absolutely not take a step back hearing her Resolute answer Glenn nodded and agreed to unlock the treasure he said very well From This Moment On Your Destiny will be Rewritten with the power of a valkyrie step into a completely new Journey she dawned a beautiful Valkyrie outfit welcome to the team Valkyrie Marilyn she replied strongly the crowd around cheered proudly Valkyrie Marilyn Valkyrie maryn Valkyrie maryn seeing that scene y Wu thought proudly compared to the previous timeline this time she finally smiled brightly and became a valkyrie Marilyn but this is just the beginning beginning if her world cannot Escape the Fate of Destruction I will definitely find a way to help those she loves avoid that tragic fate at the top of the icy Mountain he said we have arrived welcome to the home of the main god the Golden City looking up at the Magnificent Palace before him Yu exclaimed It's So Glorious next to him Marilyn nervously replied I don't know why I feel so tense suddenly a group of Valkyries descended surrounding Marilyn and saying the little sister has finally arrived let us have a look at you the valkyrie looked around and asked the person next to her I heard this time there's also a very powerful Mor is that the young man over there Valkyrie introduced herself Marilyn I represent the valkyrie Legion and welcome you to join us we look forward to your future combat performances Marilyn cheerfully replied got it so slay is this the true Valkyrie she turned to Y woo and asked you are the moral who killed the frost giant right no need to be monest the father of the main God has allowed a moral to enter the Golden City it's truly a once in a century event enough to show they recognize your strength y Wu responded that's right beautiful Valkyries however it's not solely my achievement it's also thanks to the main god Glenn's support Glenn smiled and instructed next I will take G Wu to meet the father of the main god you all take Marilyn back to the lounge convenient V Leever get acquainted with the new environment the valkyrie cheerfully replied understood you must be tired too when looking at the couple in front of her Marilyn couldn't hide her excitement wow they really look good together you w thought to himself they could not be more suited if only she knew the outcome was that the valkyrie and the main god were in love would she still say such blind words of love but with this old ridiculous law it's clear that the father of the God is conservative although he is quite difficult to deal with in order to defeat the final boss I absolutely cannot be cowardly suddenly someone spoke up the main god of like Glenn the Mortal yiwu has been granted permission to enter the Temple of the Gods the main God has not yet reached a unified stance regarding the entry of Mortals into the City of Gold pay attention to your actions and words later do you understand they murmured the father of the main god actually allowed a mortal to enter the Holy Temple this is the first time since the creation of the world but will it break the rules and laws established for thousands of years the valkyrie has been granted divine power that's one thing but how can a human have the qualifications to enter the Holy Temple augustiny the father of the main god sat on the throne and said I have permitted it no need for further words mortal youth previously you displayed an extremely marvelous technique in the trial location if you can can present it to me it would facilitate the management and oversight of the nine Realms or be utilized on the battlefield are you willing to offer it hearing this yuu replied of course the craftsmanship of a mere mortal like me is regarded with esteem by the great father of the main god therefore I shall present it with reverence then he curiously asked what is this mechanical service we have never encountered such strange new technology before looking at the item before him he prayed indeed this is a technique never seen in the nine Realms the internal structure is exquisitely extraordinary and the energy conversion rules are also unlike any magical system you were not an ordinary mortal in the nine Realms where do you really come from seeing that expression on his face Yi Wu thought to himself the father of this main God doesn't seem as conservative as I imagined how is he different from the previous timeline or should I probe further he replied where I come from is not important what matters is what I can bring to you right hearing Yu's tone another main god suddenly shouted how bold you dare to speak like that to the father of the main god guards sees this rude moral for me Aline angered released a beam of golden light and shouted be silent they hurriedly responded Yes we will deed the father of the main God's wishes he said although you are an ill-mannered one you do not speak wrongly I I am looking forward to what you will bring however your mortal body cannot stay long in the Golden City this Divine craftsmanship power is a reward and expectation for you take it suddenly a golden light surrounded him he exclaimed Divine craftsmanship power the system immediately explained Divine craftsmanship power belongs to the Divine level limited Divine rank it can enhance the abilities of the account that possesses this attribute the host can use emergency skills at the m level in The Limited Divine world to craft the strongest Divine level artifacts yiu was overjoyed thinking I can craft Divine level artifacts amazing but the account already had the ability to craft Divine level artifacts so what's the difference between the two at that moment I Vis appeared beside him explaining I will clarify for the master the two are actually very different in different dimensions the definition of divine level is also completely different right now we are in a high Divine level Dimension therefore Divine level artifacts created here will be much stronger than those in other dimensions upon hearing this Yu's eyes lit up he silently calculated so that means with Divine craftsmanship power I can freely craft artifacts in this Golden City this trip is definitely worth it looking at the Divine level guide in his hand ye Wu murmured however the materials in this guide seem really outlandish I wonder if I can find enough in this world Divine level drug translation guide Resurrection fruit of Life crown of Destruction Aura of Supremacy proof of immortality leading to Resurrection he continued to obtain divine power there is a price to pay every month you must generate three God auras of different levels if you fail to do so not only will your divine power be revoked but you will also be expelled from the city of gold do you understand you would nodded and replied understood I look forward to good news in his heart he thought it's fine to do a little work for this buff after that he ordered Glenn take him to the god of craftsmanship if there are no other reports the meeting is adjourned for today everyone replied in unison understood while walking Yu curiously asked Lord who is the god of craftsmanship Glenn explained the god of craftsmanship is not just one person but all the top level Craftsman in the nine Realms combined into a guild in the Golden City however all the members are from the dwarf race after all they are the best at this in the nine Realms but ye woo even if it is the god of craftsmanship in one month at most only one top tier artifact can be created the father of the main god requires three top tier artifacts can you do it he replied nonchalant I will think of a way to make it work right earlier you mentioned the pollution in the frost giant what exactly is it he responded I only know a little about the details it's just that in the nine Realms there are some news circulating it seems like it's about to cause quite a bit of harm the main god is also negotiating on how to handle it suddenly he tensed up and said hypothetically I mean hypothetically is there a possibility that this pollution could spread within the Golden City Glenn turned to look at him and replied are you worried about this don't worry this can never happen because the dwelling place of the main god is protected by divine power that evil infectious substance will never be able to corrode it youu answered awkwardly is that so he secretly speculated haha then why did I just hear a familiar Whisper of evil in the Holy Temple it seems that this Golden City is not as Divine and safe as Glenn said after that he pointed to the gate ahead and said we have arrived this is the entrance to the god of craftsmanship but next we will have to go deep underground the average temperature down there exceeds 100° do you need me to cast a heat protection magic for you he gently declined thank you but I don't need it I inherently belong to the fire element and higher temperatures aren't an issue for me they passed through the gate Glenn spoke up well let's head down I bet these two brothers have been arguing fiercely again y wo unexpectedly asked arguing indeed seder and blower were arguing seder exclaimed loudly I told you to listen to to me I know how to forge the king sword yet the other stubbornly countered what are you joking about your method is truly crap the king sword must be made my way they were in a heated debate when Glenn and Y Wu walked in Glenn asked are you two arguing about the new artifact forging again they were startled turning back to say Glenn what are you doing here and why is there a little human kid behind you Yi Wu greeted them warmly if the two seniors don't mind I'd like to try forging the king sword both of them gaped and shouted What Glenn introduced this is Yu although he's human he has also been granted Divine craftsmanship Power by the father of the main god along with the privilege of being a guest of the Golden City yiu bowed and said hello two seniors cidy greeted so you are the person with the marvelous craftsmanship technique from the Legends welcome welcome blower looked disp warning what even though I don't want to dwell on why the father of the main God has made an exception to allow a mortal into the Golden City if you dare disturb our work I will absolutely not let you go Yi Wu calmly explained I apologize for interrupting your work but I have no choice your father requested that I create three top tier artifacts each month I can't afford to be lazy because no one dares disobey your father siger was surprise asking what our entire God of craftsmanship takes over a month to create one top tier artifact the father of the main God wants you to create three in a month how can that be done blower burst into loud laughter mocking haha I didn't expect the father of the main God could also misjudge a lowly human daring to forge artifacts what a joke even if the king sword is not a top tier artifact I will absolutely not entrust it to you for crafting doing so with only waste materials get out of the Golden City this is not a place for you blower was Furious pointing his finger and shouting loudly don't you have the slightest seriousness of a Craftsman my work always requires care especially when crafting artifacts this is not a joke you are tarnishing the honor of a sacred Craftsman I absolutely will not allow a mortal to pollute it Yu crossed his arms and calmly replied ultimately whether this is a joke or not let me try and you will know if I fail I am willing to compensate double the cost of lost materials along with a wish that both of you desire blower burst into laughter to the point of Tears ridiculing you really make me laugh until I die compensation granting a wish do you think that just because you have been granted a bit of divine craftsmanship power you can stand on equal footing with a god fine if you are so mad I will let you try but if you truly succeed I will give you an additional artifact as a reward s hearing this could not help but feel anxious and asked are you sure the materials for forging artifacts are extremely valuable Stardust meteorite ecliptic fragment God of War steel these things are basically unobtainable Yu smiled confidently don't worry I have never done anything that I was not sure of yiu entered the crafting room he held the design blueprint and thought for a while from the design map he realized the king sword is indeed an art fact but only at a level slightly better than legendary there are no special breakthroughs in any aspect but its flexibility is very strong making it extremely suitable to support the special effects of various attributes Yi Wu had prepared the forging enchanting and gemology techniques he used all of his abilities combined with the god of craftsmanship to craft this sword into a highlevel attribute artifact yiu gathered his energy raised the hammer and began to forge looked at him and praise truly impressive it sounds quite remarkable blower however sneered and said sarcastically hemp no substance just putting on a show he turned to Glenn and asked Glenn why haven't you left yet didn't you say you were busy all day Glenn replied calmly staying a little longer is fine the most important thing is that I am very curious to see how far ye W can go after all he has created equipment never seen before such as the interdimensional secret realm monitoring device blower was surprised and asked what he was able to do that sidary could hardly believe it ever since the Spectrum Road broke down even the omniscient Crystal of the father of the main God cannot penetrate through time and space to investigate the peak how could he do it blower added this kid always appears calm could he really be suddenly the room emitted a blinding light blower shouted these are three people rushing in blower still couldn't believe it no way could this kid have really done it moreover it hasn't even been half a day while this sword at least needs three days and nights to forge successfully sigari urged stop doubting let's go see won't we know then inside Yi Wu held the sword and joyfully said it's done the system displayed information about the king sword a legendary sword containing true power only those worthy of King ship can fully unleash its strength Fusion the sword's body can change shape according to the career of its owner activating unpredictable attack methods Spirit blade enhances all attributes of the owner if the owner is a god it increases divine power Myriad forms the king sword will change according to the current attributes of its owner and it will also assist in executing the corresponding ultimate skill based on those attributes the king sword turns out to be merely a mid-level artifact but now its entire energy has achieved the level of an artifact siger Gast not only has he completed the Divine level team blower added he even reinforced it how can this be possible Yu handed the sword to Glenn saying Glenn Lord you have extensive knowledge please take a look at this sword Glenn took the sword inspected it for a moment and suddenly exclaimed this is the first time I have felt the resonance between the sword body and the divine power the attribute within me this sword truly harmonizes perfectly with my attributes transforming into the most familiar weapon this feeling is completely different from using any artifact I have used before it's too shocking blower snatched the sword from Glenn's hand I can't believe the sword King has this kind of ability this must just be an illusion he channeled energy into the sword and suddenly felt a strange power exclaiming what is this power emanating from this sword it feels like in just a moment I have rejuvenated by 200 years my Peak state has returned I could Forge iron continuously for a month without rest sari snatched the sword shouting all right all right before this you looked down on them and now you're so infatuated don't covet it any longer quickly return the sword to its owner blower lamented huh I haven't had enough fun yet he pretended to cough for a few moments before saying forget it I admit that I misjudged judged your skills are indeed extraordinary no wonder you are recognized by Our Father although I have a hot temper I've always kept my word the artifact I promised before I absolutely will not go back on my word while saying that he thought differently am I stupid enough to give you a truly effective artifact how about I give you a little surprise instead he he suddenly tossed out a wig next I give you this artifact golden long hair y wo caught the wig his face full of confusion huh golden long hair the system displayed the information golden long hair of cfus long and free-spirited made from pure gold containing auxiliary divine power it can be attached to the head to grow long hair permanently never to fall out Yi Wu remained silent his expression deep in thought cider stepped forward and said this is ridiculous blower are you cheating why are you giving me an artifact that has no effect I'm not bald blower sneered just mind your own business I only said I would give a gift but I never said what I would give suddenly yiu was over Joy to the point of Tears he ran over and grasped Blower's hand his voice filled with gratitude thank you blower senior this artifact of yours truly has a tremendous effect on me I had never thought I would receive such a precious gift blower chuckled softly replying no need to thank me ye w delightedly thought with this artifact can I completely eliminate the depression related to the account Immortal Baldi moreover I can use it indefinitely without worrying about any side effects an incredibly useful artifact like this is truly a great deal this only makes me look forward to the next treasure hunting Expedition even more in another place Yu began to calculate he carefully considered true ey is a magical skill if used carelessly it's easy to be detected should I use a cloaking device this person has the ability to scan the entire Golden City without leaving a trace looking at the map yiu smiled he discovered the treasure and realized that the number of guards around was even fewer than expected he thought to himself this is Utopia a place where at night one doesn't even need to lock the door the scenery before me is truly wonderful then I won't hold back let's see what Treasures the God's Vault holds it's really something to anticipate yiu approached the door telling himself that he had swiftly overcome all obstacles to gear where he stood was before the door leading to The Treasure of the father of the Gods he observed the large door and noticed that it was sturdy not easily broken the mechanism on the door seemed to require a precise series of actions to open and any mistakes could potentially trigger the alarm system though unwilling he had to give up the idea of breaking down the door suddenly someone grabbed his shoulder and asked vwoo why are you here Yi Wu was confused wondering how he could be spotted when he was clearly in a state of invisibility the person in front of him was Marilyn her face flushed as she said I've been looking for you for a long time I Finally Found You Yu was surprised Marilyn what do you want with me she hugged him tightly with an emotional expression saying woo I missed you so much since entering the Golden City you haven't come to find me I feel so lonely Yu pondered then coldly replied miss me don't joke pretending to be someone else to tease me is a bit disappointing which deity are you if you don't mind please reveal your name Marilyn laughed and admitted oh how could I be seen through in just one second haven't you all reached that level of intimacy yet the deceiver transformed while nervously stammering I apologize I'm sorry I'm sorry I added a little drama just as you said this is just a joke please pleas don't mind let me reintroduce myself I am Locker a main god seeing a moral wandering around the treasure at midnight I couldn't help but want to tease you are you also interested in the treasures within this Vault yiu smiled in response Lord ler you are too modest if you truly wanted to deceive me how could I ever have seen through it I'm here merely out of curiosity wanting to tour what lies inside the Vault but seeing the large door locked so tightly I intended to leave leave when I encountered you he thought to himself that this woman was quite strange it would be best not to linger around her he turned to Bid Farewell if there's nothing else I will take my leave she quickly called out wait Locker pointed at the door implying having come this far wouldn't it be a Pity to just leave aren't you quite curious about this treasure I can open this door would you like to join me in exploring Yi Wu readily agreed that sounds wonderful thank you you Lord at that moment aiv viz appeared with a warning Master there is absolutely no emotional Spectrum eminating from this woman I cannot discern her intentions is this truly the terrifying power of a main god ye W made plans and now she could only go along with her and find an opportunity to ask for the purpose in short she had to be cautious L your urged what are you still standing there for let's go this moment is for expanding your horizons y Wu replied all right inside a tree shimmering with golden light made Yi Wu exclaim oh is this really The Treasure of the Gods it's truly magnificent lock you're introduced this is where everything has been kept since the father of the Gods created the world until now the most valuable artifacts and treasures are displayed by the golden tree it symbolizes the pillar of the nine Realms and it is also the world tree yuker Yi Wu stood before a large door unable to hide her amazement standing before these artifacts a mortal like me feels so small is this truly something a mere mortal can behold she glanced at locker and asked ler Lord what is your true intention in bringing me here a beautiful and Powerful main goddess like you surely wouldn't be kind to a mortal without reason would you lir smiled and replied you have a sweet tongue being trusted by the father of the gods to the extent of having you forg the king's sword shows you are clear clearly not an ordinary mortal she winked and continued as for my purpose I hope you can assist me in a task upon completion I will allow you to choose any artifact here as your reward y Wu asked again his voice full of Doubt is the reward really that precious the difficulty of this matter surely cannot be low right can an insignificant mortal like me really accomplish it the girl in front of him smiled and replied confidently of course only you can do this it's actually quite simp simple she leaned close and whispered into Yi Wu's ear just make a slight adjustment to the special equipment you provided to the father of the main god for monitoring the nine Realms and secret Realms make it so that it cannot display certain things that I don't want to see yiu hesitated for a moment and took a small step back he said this really isn't a difficult task for me but if the father of the main god discovers that I've deceived him my little life may not be safe Locker smiled hugged guwu and gently said don't worry the final interpretation of the technique lies in your hands he won't notice moreover if you are truly discovered I promise to ensure that you won't die she looked directly into Yu's eyes her gaze seeming to reassure him so what do you think the promise of a god should have alleviated your concerns right upon hearing this ye W nodded and made a decision if that's the case then I agree the girl smiled with satisfaction that's more like it very obedient however in yiwu's heart there were still private thoughts he wondered what is it that shouldn't be seen could it be pollution from deep space this is quite Troublesome being able to easily enter and exit the treasure Vault indicates that her strength is absolutely terrifying if I refuse my life may be at risk damn it I don't want to get caught up in the struggle between Gods ye woo spoke up it's getting late let's just end it here for today suddenly she pierced through y woo her voice dripping with mockery of course you can make your exit now the system announced all attributes are punished reduced by 90% And the use of recovery items and Magic is prohibited ye W spat blood panicked as he questioned why didn't I agree to help you why are you still harming me loir laughed heartily a main god like me relying on a mere mortal like you to do work did you really think this was sincere killing you directly would solve everything wouldn't it luring you here was merely to have a reason to report to the father of the main god ler continued his tone dripping with disdain humans are greedy scheming to steal forbidden artifacts and I discovered and killed you I'm having a lot of fun tonight I'll Grant you a reward and at the same time give you a warning before your reincarnation never trust any words from a deceitful God Yu gritted his teeth no longer holding back he retorted if you dare to provoke me first then I will not be polite a deceitful and scheming God right I will make you pay dearly ler smirked condescendingly oh really I was looking forward to seeing how you would do that but now you don't have the opportunity or time anymore yiu laughed filled with confidence time I have plenty of it he activated his ability to rewind time notification system the time has returned to the exact moment designated by the host ye W breathed the sigh of relief that was really dangerous I didn't expect the level and strength of the high-ranking main god to be so terrifying if it worked for this time manipulation skill I definitely wouldn't stand a chance against her he returned to 3 hours earlier but this time it wasn't without gains at least Yu had remembered the method to unlock the main God's large door he thought to himself from now on I can always go back the only thing is the lying God and the scheming ler suddenly appeared she seems to be afraid of me like this she must be concerned that my abilities will allow the main god to uncover some of her schemes ye we seriously pondered I have to uncover this secret so I can devise a strategy to win against her he slightly worriedly asked system can I use the time manipulation skill to observe ler her level is truly formidable the system responded the time manipulation skill surpasses all existing beings in the current Dimension the host can use it with confidence on any person or God hearing this yiu felt more at ease then let me see what truth is being concealed in her schemes and lies initiate the time control wire he snapped his fingers and the system immediately announced it was starting up the location is recreated the first significant event the scene before me is a colossal Castle there the land of giant John meon is advancing towards the castle at the center of the castle stands a giant named Ram ha R NE spoke what brings you here Locker if your movements are discovered by Austine our plan will be threatened ler replied her tone completely calm don't be timid about such matters Ram H the old man Spectrum Road has already been destroyed by me he can no longer freely monitor the Affairs of the realm and other Dimensions she continued still maintaining her calm demeanor recently a morel has come to provide the old man with something that can monitor the nine Realms although the effectiveness of it has yet to be determined I am here to remind you to strengthen the protection of our secret Ram hi furrowed his brow puzzled can aistin actually see through a mortal's possessions is he pretending to be clueless the secret personally guarded by me is absolutely error free do you doubt that I am inferior to a mere mortal she turned her back and slightly curled her lips don't be so serious you are an important partner of mine why would I doubt you it's just a reminder after all that moral I will find a chance to deal with now I must go see my beloved treasure in another place she stared intently at the object in front of her her eyes filled with satisfaction a my treasure has grown obediently today hasn't it a different voice rang out with warning the pollution of evil power power from this thing is not something you can control nearby a skinny man named solto was tightly bound high above he shouted his eyes full of resentment ler you crazy woman daring to lure me here and imprison me for so long I should have torn you apart but if you release me now I might still leave you a way out ler removed her mask sneering you truly are a tough man you interest me I intentionally restrained you next to the super possession for so long and yet you haven't been tainted quite surprising it seems I must increase the level of pollution without your cooperation the effectiveness of my plan will be significantly diminished sulto was pushed to the brink of screaming in pain ah you bastard just wait until I regain my freedom I will make sure you die a gruesome death the third important event ler and Glenn stood facing each other beside a small waterfall why do you refuse my sincere feelings Glenn even though I am the goddess of Deceit and wicked schemes my feelings for you are genuine Glenn replied I'm sorry Lord ler Your Love gives me a headache but I cannot reciprocate in my heart there is someone else she felt as if struck by lightning what in the Golden City there is no woman stronger than I why must you refuse me for a small weak woman he looked at her with a lovic gaze and answered because love does not only come from admiration of power but also from a smile or an act I'm sorry Lord laier her face darkened you may leave now Glenn immediately responded very well he turned and walked away ler lowered her head slightly her face darkened her eyes showing pain but she said no more at the same time at the fourth important event the father of gods was pierced Through the Heart by a spear he cried out in pain how do you possess such great evil strength lock your held the spear a wave of dark power surrounding her that is because I have given up myself yielding my body to the Embrace of the outer God your era has come to an end the main God Rest assured I will inherit your legacy and lead the main god into a new greater super era he fell silent so it turns out you were just playing tricks but truly it's embarrassing Locker you being a main god yet still have to bow down before that dark outer God's power it's really laughable she laughed maniacally laughable then so what with absolute power I can forsake everything with absolute power I can control everything including the lives and deaths of gods she continued that's right you're long lost son for refusing to cooperate with me I killed him as well the feeling of killing such a powerful main god is truly irresistible next it will be your turn the spear pierced his body creating a large hole the spear struck the ground hard Locker clad in the armor of a main god sat upon the throne the era of Supremacy belongs to the outer gods and it begins here haha after seeing everything clearly he recalled the order come here ended the system responded reversing time command received starting time reversed he returned to the moment at the beginning in his mind the pieces gradually came together and the truth behind the events had essentially become clear he sat in deep thought the deep space hypercube is the outer God from deep within the universe it has contaminated the nine Realms and locker locker kills and disguises herself as the main God all because she harbers a grudge against Glenn when I was with Marilyn she targeted me like that however ler absolutely did not expect to ultimately lose to the mysterious force from Maryland I exchanged with the system to aim for a perfect conclusion I absolutely cannot trigger that power of Marilyn but if I want to kill locker before she can act against the main god I must find another way I is asked but master that woman is cunning and very powerful what should we do to turn the tables on her should we directly report to the father of gods he tightened his grip that would be ineffective I would be seen as Immortal falsely accusing the main god and would be heavily punished but I have thought of another way I this question truly deserving of the title Master to have found a method to deal with a powerful foe in such a short time amazing what is that method he smiled wickedly it's very simple the enemy of my enemy is my friend the next Target save Thor the God of Thunder blower and sideri were stunned sideri exclaimed oh my God Yu do you do you know what you are doing the three stood in front of a colossal furnace Yu replied calmly this is the furnace and forging platform that we have upgraded using techniques that have been over 10,000 years in the making this is an ancient artifact a masterpiece that took thousands of years to create I'm not mistaken am I the Divine flame has the ability to harness Divine fire from the Earth's core to melt rare Metals after being upgraded with special technology the melting rate of metals has been increased by 30% the forging platform is made from fragments of the creation God's iron through technical upgrades the stability during forging has been improved by an additional 30% hearing this SED exclaimed that's amazing we were only tasked with crafting artifacts and you went ahead and improved an ancient artifact elevating it to an entirely different level y Wu smiled one must sharpen their tools if they want to do their job well I am just building upon the foundation laid by the seniors and making slight enhancements to the Divine flame and forging platform he continu with these upgrades the process of crafting artifacts will be much more efficient along with the King sword from before our task of creating the three artifacts assigned to us by the Divine orders can now be considered complete right sidary asked of course these three items are all top tier artifacts we consider them peak level artifacts but Yu seeing you in such a hurry is there something else you need to do Yi Wu nodded indeed there is something senior if I want to go to the land of giants jenim what should I do he widened his eyes jenim that's the main Battlefield of the Gods and the Giants a place of extreme danger and cold why you want go there blower interjected slightly annoyed what are you hesitating for if y Wu wants to go he surely has his reasons don't pry into his private matters Mr blower added if you want to go to jenim you should look for Glenn he's the master of that Battlefield the leader of the valkyrie Legion he will definitely have a way Yu waved his hand thank you see your blower then I will take my leave now after yugu left the two turned to chat sighing this kid is truly remarkable his presence may just bring about a series of changes blower chuckled softly isn't that quite interesting we oldtimers have been too rigid now embracing change isn't a bad idea at the valkyrie gate of Victory a group of people is gathering Glenn the lord of the group stands in front of them and announces the valkyrie has completed the assembly our stronghold in the land of giants jenim is under a large scale attack by the Giants by the decree of the Gods we need to immediately provide reinforcements everyone must be particularly attentive this battle is extremely dangerous and there could be life-threatening risks at any moment so Focus all your spirit youu flies close closer to Glenn and says are you planning to go to the Land of the Giants then take me with you I also have matters to attend to there Glenn looks at him with surprise you want to go with us ye Wu nods firmly that's right after all I need to resolve some issues there Glenn thinks for a moment and then agrees all right if you want to go then be prepared we will depart immediately the Warriors quickly organized their formation and prepared to set out everyone understands that this mission is not only dangerous but also decisive for their future vachel pointed at him with an attitude impudent Lord Glenn is conveying the idict of the god of creation how dare you a mere mortal interrupt besides is the land of giants a place where mortals can tread it's one thing at ordinary times but right now is a critical moment before the Great War if you act impudently you should know how to distinguish the situation he scratched his head looking apologetic I'm sorry I'm sorry it was wrong of me to barge in suddenly but my intention to go to the land of giants is no joke after all I can contribute my meager strength to the fight the other members began to argue what do we need a mortal like you to help are you looking down on our Valkyries you're just a blacksmith and yet you dare to speak so grandly you better go back to forging iron another voice countered don't underestimate Yu's power he is very capable Glenn furrowed his brows and spoke decisively all right I will make the decision myself having your help would certainly be great but the task that the god of creation has entrusted is the most important what if we are held accountable if it is not completed he interrupted don't worry I had already taken care of the three God Spirits Glenn was a bit astonished what to complete such an almost impossible mission in such a short time you truly have refreshed my understanding his G gradually became serious as he transformed into battle like form if that's the case then I have no reason to stop you any longer this matter should not be delayed seeing Glenn in that state Yu couldn't help but think great is this really Glenn's true battle form his power and level have significantly increased like this Glenn raised his hand toward the portal and said departure Yu replied confidently yes in the land of giants jenim Divine out posts everywhere were blown to Smither some said this final defense line must be held firm absolutely do not let the frost Giants Advance a single step but this attack from them is fiercer than ever what is happening people around were discussing and confusion what is happening our side is dying in greater numbers yet their forces are increasing what kind of nonsense is this the frost Giants roared Roar they said this time we are surely doomed just as the situation was in chaos a brilliant light descended from the sky Shadows with Wings slowly appeared within the beam of light causing all eyes to be drawn to it that that is the crowd L by Glenn arrived and the Roar of Cheers erupted Glenn of the lie and the Valkyries are here to lead us great we are saved now Glenn turned to vachel and said vachel you lead the other Valkyries to clear the enemies near the main entrance at the same time y woo and I will deal with the boss of the eny faction vachell dissatisfied pressed why didn't I always go with you to kill the boss of the enemy faction before why the sudden change now Yu he's just Immortal how can he be your right-hand man Glenn's eyes turned cold now is not the time to argue follow my orders vachel was scared to pness but reluctantly replied fine okay she led the group to slay Giants while Glenn shouted everyone here follow me kill all invading enemies do not let any Giants pass to Sea not even half a step on the other side y wo and Glenn approached the boss Glenn reminded be careful y woo based on the current situation the boss we have to face is likely a necromantic frost Mage y Wu silently noted necromantic Frost Mage but just a moment of distraction caused him to be hit by the boss's attack Glenn narrowly dodged and shouted Li woo the boss is Diggins the giant Frost Dragon Standing Tall before them next to Ames the frost witch she mocks you brought a mere human to fight me Glenn are you underestimating me too much Glenn in a battle ready stance smirks I didn't expect it would be you am your king is so determined to Counterattack the Divine realm yet he sends you to the battlefield it seems today's battle will be tougher than I anticipated suddenly a loud explosion rang out followed by Yu's challenging voice I admit highlevel fairies like you all are indeed beyond my capability but it's not like I'll be killed immediately right so Glenn that giantis is yours I'll handle the frost Dragon Diggins opened its mouth full of sharp teeth tauntingly saying a tiny human wants to fight me are you tired of living you're not even worthy for me to stuff between my teeth am's the giantes wearing a veil burst into laughter haha you got hit by one of my ice spikes and still didn't die which shows you have quite a bit of life in you so why don't you take your time and play with him isn't that fun the frost Dragon contemptuously looked ahead it's tone cold take your time playing I have no interest I will bite through his belly leaving him no chance to regret choosing me as his opponent Yu spread his black wings and flew beside Glenn to discuss tactics Glenn I will draw the dragon away do you you think you can win one-on-one against that giantess her level seems higher than yours Glenn was slightly moved and replied you are doing this for me well it's not a matter of whether I can win or not but I must win you also have to be careful the frost dragon is not a trivial opponent after their discussion Yu spread his wings wide and flew straight toward the frost Dragon loudly provoking come on Dragon let me see if your strength is as rotten as your mouth indeed this taunt angered the frost Dragon it quickly shifted its Target soaring toward guwu while roaring how can a mere human like you have dragon wings I am becoming more and more interested in this one after I kill you I will study you slowly Upon finishing its words the frost Dragon Unleashed a massive blast of icy breath freezing everything below the soldiers panicked frantically shouting damn it why is the frost Dragon attacking indiscriminately stop it quickly ah yiu quickly darted to the side evading the attack stopping midair at a distance from the dragon he swung his hand Conjuring a massive red flame that rushed straight toward the frost Dragon while attacking yiu silently analyzed the situation the level of the chaien emperor could contend with level 220 but this Dragon was level 320 even utilizing the elemental Advantage the gap of over 100 Levels could not be bridged the frost Dragon did not Dodge at all instead it used its sturdy dragon body to withstand the fire as a result the great flame only reduced its Health by 2% the giant dragon sneered so it turns out to be fire attribute is this your source of confidence unfortunately this attack is not enough to break my defense haha you think being small makes you Nimble let's see how long you can keep running as soon as the words left its mouth the frost Dragon flapped its powerful Wings creating a massive Vortex harrying frigid energy sweeping straight toward Yu within the vortex numerous sharp ice shards spun round charging at terrifying speed Yu dodged while trying to formulate a countermeasure that's right not only is there a significant level difference but this is also its home turf the cold air and magical power in this atmosphere it uses them as if they are Limitless I must draw its aggro away first then think of my next move Yu was deep in thought when he suddenly jolted realizing that the frost Dragon had appeared right in front of him at some point it Unleashed a powerful breath of icy air and roared die the terrifying burst of cold air set yiwu flying crashing hard into the icy wall behind him a loud thud echoed and Ice dust flew everywhere the frost Dragon looked at its opponent being thrown away and laughed loudly ha a pesky fly should be swatted dead without Mercy this time I fear that there will be nothing left of you struggling to sit up Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth the previous blow had knocked off 80% of his health leaving him in pain all over his body looking at the arrogantly laughing opponent in front of him Yu thought helplessly this dragon is too powerful combined with many unfavorable factors it looks like a desperate situation but I didn't come here to kill it rather yiu silently contacted the system with his mind system switch the account to void beast king livean I'll take this ice dry in for sure the system quickly responded receiving order switching the system announced the skill void beast king livean is divided into three stages the primary stage contain 100% of tame beasts below level 300 the intermediate stage contain those below level 600 and the advanced stage contain those below level 900% the notification system current account level beginner beast king can enhance 30% of combat pet attributes Master various traps and methods to tame beasts players need to reduce the target's Health below 20% Then use trapping equipment to capture and finally use the Beast cane Mark youu smile brightly after hearing this awesome this is exactly why I chose the frost dragon as my opponent with its power equivalent to level 300 it also has an additional 30% Soul link from Crimson Comet raising its combat strength against dragons to nearly level 400 next let's see you then crimsom Comet crimsom Comet excitedly looked at y woo and let out a few sounds g g g outside the icy Cliff where Yi Wu had just Fallen the frost Dragon was staring intently at the ice ball trying to search hemp why can I still sense a faint breath is this guy still not dead Let Me Take One Last Breath to finish him off but before the frost Dragon could strike a gantic red dragon broke through the ice its size comparable to its own then roared gr Crimson Comet unexpectedly lunged forward biting hard into the frost dragon's neck the frost dragon's Health immediately dropped to only 70% the frost Dragon cried out in pain ah it hurts what is happening why did this guy suddenly turn into before it could finish speaking the Crimson Comet charged in once again sending the frost dragon flying away in just a minute its Health dropped sharply reduced to only 50% the frost Dragon roared in disbelief aw impossible such power absolutely cannot come from a human Yu stood tall on the head of the Crimson CET mocking with your brain capacity it's hard for me to explain much more just obediently become my Mount to avoid further pain the enormous red dragon that had knocked the frost Dragon down to half its Health was the void beast king Red Dragon the appearance of the Void beast king changed according to the battle dragon that y Wu controled the frost Dragon struggled to stabilize its body furiously shouting even the frost Giants cane could not subdue me to become a mount how dare a human think of riding on me what a delusion super compressed frost breath saying this the frost Dragon Unleashed a blast of freezing breath far stronger than before unfazed the Crimson comment also released a surge of Blazing Heat directly confronting the frost dragon's super compressed frost breath a strong stream of breath collided with another y woo while attacking advised put your hands down a dead ice dragon holds no value for me the icy breath that the frost Dragon spouted was gradually pushed back by the scorching Heat Of The Crimson Comet eventually the heat from the Crimson Comet shot straight into the mouth of the frost Dragon a hissing sound erupted as if several of the frost Dragon Teeth had broken its blood level drastically decreased leaving only 18% the frost Dragon held its mouth and groaned I hate you y woo aha I will kill you ah y woo rode the Crimson Comet closer to the frost Dragon Inside I told you to give up resisting but you didn't listen now you know pain right come on obediently Let Me Ride hearing ye W say he wanted to ride on it the frost Dragon roared in Anger ah even if I die I absolutely will not allow anyone to Ry on my head as it stood up the ground beneath the frost Dragon suddenly lit up chains of brilliant gold appeared simultaneously on its neck and limbs the frost Dragon thrashed wildly but was immediately ins snared by streaks of golden lightning from the chains causing it to become even more Furious this is the Trap of that damned human let me go aha the system notification echoed in Yu's head the target has triggered the binding trap held below 20% The Taming condition has been met but the target is above level 300 and is in an extreme frenzy State the success rate for taming is 70% y woo muttered 70% huh as long as it's not 100% there's a chance of failure I can't take that risk Yu's mind raced to find a solution I've finally managed to catch a big one I need to find a way to ensure I don't fail but how the frost dragon trapped by youu binding trap lay flat on the ground frantically cursing damn it this Shamy thing don't think you can bind me for long just wait until I freeze this trap into pieces the frost Dragon thrashed violently lightning seeming to be on the verge of spiraling out of control the system immediately issued a warning warning warning The Binding trap will lose Effectiveness in 1 minute upon failure the cool down time will be 30 minutes please make a prompt decision on whether to attempt taming yet y wo still could not come to a decision wait there must be another way to increase the success rate of The Taming let me think YW suddenly remembered got it how could I forget the good item I obtained from AAL isn't it perfect for this situation system quickly used that skill book the system immediately carried out the command received learning in progress please wait a moment at this moment the frost Dragon had rbl free and approached y wo proudly laughing haha what now you're out of options do you really think you can ride me with just this little power dream on even if I'm forced to endure humiliation for my survival I will still yield only to True power you think you're worthy to ride me aha yiu stepped forward walked toward it and calmly spoke is that so don't speak so absolutely whether I ride or not is not important what matters is that I sincerely want to be your friend the frost Dragon looked disdainful be friends I'd never make friends with the weak a human like you wants to reach me dream on you're only fit to be crushed under my foot haha at this moment the system announced again the host has learned the skilled toxic immunity friendship across rances which permanently increases friendship with driving companions at the same time the system announced the completion of the skill the frost dragon's mood also shifted its eyes gleamed brightly ah what is this my rage suddenly vanished and again my hatred toward him has disappeared this guy looks much more pleasant the frost Dragon gaped at Yu as he approached are you calm now can we have a proper conversation the frost Dragon closed its mouth suddenly smiled amicably and spoke I I apologize bro I admit I spoke a bit too loudly earlier don't take a c heart but we do need to settle this Between Brothers it's fine being Brothers but wanting to ride me that's not really cool is it as soon as this statement was made the system announced to Yu the affection level of the target has improved the success rate of taming has reached 100% would you like to tame now Yu commanded the system to tame with his thoughts and then turned to the frost Dragon so that settled then whether I ride or not is another matter mainly I just want to have this brother here the system worked very quickly soon announcing the result the target has been tamed Frost dragon' is in hand the frost dragon is a boss level combat pet and a common Mount which can be used normally without going through the void beast king account immediately after The Binding trap on the frost Dragon was removed the frost Dragon also regained its full strength flapping its wings and excitedly saying hey feel free to ride me brother I totally accept this you go big I go small one day's elder brother a lifetime time his elder brother yiu was pleased very good then yiu quietly turned his gaze toward a distant Castle next is the Royal City of the frost Dragon th solto is imprisoned there breaking in will definitely be extremely dangerous I will help Glenn defeat this Invasion first then find a way to save him on the other side in a fiercely contested area the entire sky was engulfed in a sea of flames and smoke with loud shouts boosting morale echoing throughout out Valkyries must not Retreat vachel spread her wings wide wielding her sword to sweep across as another group of armored soldiers fell vachile fought while commanding we must hold this final defense line the subordinate below anxiously shouted but Commander the frost necromancy Factory is unrelenting the enemy will keep coming back to life we can't hold on any longer vachile drenched in sweat and looking disheveled still clutched his sword tightly not daring to show his worry fearing it would dampen the morale of his side I know but it's been so long and Glenn still hasn't killed the enemy boss ye W must be dragging it out damn it if I had teamed up with him we would have definitely killed Boss by now as vachel paused to think an attack nearly struck him in the back fortunately Marilyn appeared just in time using her Shield to block the blow Marilyn anxiously reminded him please don't just stand there the valkyrie's captain must trust Glenn and Yu they will surely succeed in killing the boss vachile was startled and thanked her Marilyn thank you Marilyn didn't linger long once again charging into the crowd of monsters and soldiers before her shouting come on I absolutely will not let these ice shards defeat me vachile looked in surprise at the brave figure of Marilyn as she rushed away all of us are exhausted and pushed to our limits yet this Marilyn despite her low level seems to have Boundless Energy still full of Vitality vachile thought to himself but no matter how many waves of attacks we repel as long as the boss is not defeated we cannot win I have to disobey Glenn's orders should I leave the battlefield to help him but now I'm exhausted what good can I possibly do damn it it's all Yu's fault at that moment a gigantic ice dragon suddenly appeared in the sky continuously letting out a thunderous roar roar Roar everyone below upon seeing the frost dragon flying towards them panicked and shouted to vachel Captain look at that Frost Dragon level 320 we should vachile tense looked at the frost dragon and commanded everyone hold your swords tightly even if our final outcome is death we must choose to wield our swords and fight bravely saying this vachel took up his sword and flew up to leave the attack the whole team immediately followed behind vachile fighting with all their might yes as a result the frost Dragon just as it got close unleashed the blast of icy breath aimed straight at the attacking soldiers of vile's Team Roar frostbone rage the soldiers below were baffled what's going on the frost dragon is attacking our own people the frost Dragon continued to fly unleashing its icy breath along the way freezing all the soldiers and monsters below Roar the people present at the scene were stunned and exclaimed am I dreaming that Frost dragon's breath it froze all the monsters solid which means it won't be able to resurrect anymore who on Earth has controlled this dragon and made such an unbelievable feat happen you rode the frost dragon and flew down in front of the vachile team Landing heavily on the ground vachile immediately instructed everyone pay attention we have not yet determined the intentions of the opponent we cannot be careless they all responded in unison yes Captain Yu crossed his arms while standing at top the dragon and spoke no need to worry it's me as soon as everyone heard that familiar voice they instantly recognized it it's ye woo Marilyn was the first to rush over and hub ye wo tightly joyfully saying Li woo it's really you I knew you could do it even this level of frost Dragon you could tame you're amazing the girls took turns crowding around y woo laughing and saying that's right you came just in time we were almost wiped out how did you tame this ice dragon we really can't believe it even the gods couldn't do it vachile felt regret for having wrongly blamed yiu earlier she was uneasy clasping her hands in front of her cautiously stepping forward and opening her mouth to say thank you y woo your timely arrival has saved all of us yet I treated you like that in short I must apologize to you YW was slightly surprised by vel's unusual attitude smiled and asked what what did you do to me why you have to apologize he merely brushed over the issue and then threw some green Potion bottles to the girls but now is not the time to talk about this take the recovery potions and then you continue to defend this place the girls received the potions nodded and replied in unison understood after Yu finished his instructions he put on his helmet mounted his dragon and bid them farewell the battle is not over yet I need to go help Glenn you must keep a good watch here do not be careless seeing y about to leave the girls also wanted to follow ah this place is no longer dangerous everyone's strength has recovered we'll go with you vachali immediately stepped forward to stop them no you all heard what yugu said we must continue to defend this place do not add more trouble for y woo and Glenn this is in order the women felt a little frightened seeing the captain so serious yes yes vachet quietly embraced her arm feeling embarrassed by her previous thoughts I was really foolish to underestimate youu like that I truly have no face to meet him again if there's another opportunity I must officially apologize to him hoping he and Glenn can return safely Yu softly spoke to the frost Dragon who had now become his good brother let's go Diggins there are many battles waiting for us next the frost dragon clapped its wings and took off replying no problem elder brother wherever you go I'm that scared Diggins reminded brother even if you and the God of Light Glenn managed to defeat yamas the frost witch's body at this level after dying will enter a far stronger wraith form at that time both of you will likely be in a state of exhausting all energy being killed easily by her Ray form in that blood-filled condition is a certainty ywu was surpriz what she had such a skill hidden this information is very important thank you Diggin Diggins continued between us Brothers there's no need for politness all over death rate state is very difficult to deal with I have a way to resolve it in the past she promised to give me a Divine level artifact if I cooperated as long as I have that I can enhance my strength to counter her R form however she is a very cautious person with many schemes so she will definitely not easily get give it to me Yu then replied this is not difficult as long as you find a way to break her State she will obediently give you that Divine level artifact after that you just need to follow my instructions at the sorrowful snowfield explosions rang out one after another and the dust was thick yamus arrogantly waved her hand you were still as formidable as before Glenn even though the level gap between us is 20 levels you can still fight me for so long it's a Pity that we could have used a method to battle the frost Witch gamas level 480 Health at 60% strength at 75% the ice monster roared Roar Glenn with just a few sword strikes had dismantled the ice Monster's body you were being overly modest yamas didn't you always defeat me compared to your ease I am merely doing my utmost to hold on Glenn level 460 Health at 20% strength at 30% Glenn silently thought of himself the difference in rank is not the important thing the reason she has become even more powerful is due to that corrupting power of evil she carries and the blessing of quan cannot dispel this current of power this time it truly is difficult to resolve the Valkyries behind will undoubtedly face a life and death challenge like a tide not to mention the safety of iwu damn it how am I supposed to defeat her just then diin swooped down from the sky calling for help Roar Yammer save me Glenn was startled and immediately turned to Yu asking are you okay Yu Yu replied I'm fine next you must definitely do as I say we have to take that giantis away immediately Glenn immediately agreed understood yamas looked at Diggins and sigh how useless even a human cannot take care of this you truly disappoint me Diggins Diggins reacted Roar no don't underestimate this human his skills are very special I was careless and fell into his trap Diggin urged hurry up bring out the frost Essence that you promised me I must tear that guy apart yamas immediately said although I promise to give you frost Essence as payment for our cooperation before you have not contributed anything at all yet you still dare to seat me out you can get lost now killing you is as easy as turning over my hand Diggins angrily replied what you dare to deceive me yamas sneered deceive so what the premise of trust is equal strength a weakling like you no longer has the right to negotiate with me if you want to oppose me I won't mind a one against three Diggins was left speechless in Anger you suddenly Glenn used his powers to bind yamas however yamus remained unperturbed provoking him oh I didn't expect you Glenn to enjoy this this kind of game just say it early if it's you I wouldn't mind satisfying your request Glenn shouted I've exerted all my strength to bind her but at most I can only hold on for about 30 seconds Yu replied that's enough follow my plan 30% of her health shouldn't take 30 seconds after that Yi Wu U's reverse flame execution in his heart he calculated previously I used the power of the Void beast king to hide dian's attributes it seems I have deceived this giantess next Comes The crucial part of the plan despite being entangled by yiu yris was still quite interested wow all you two really know how to play these games are really getting me pumped up Yi Wu reminded is that so this is just the beginning next Yu shouted now it's time to burn you suddenly yamas screamed in agony Roar this fire is not ordinary fire at this moment y y's Health was at 25% strength at 0% yamus was still dazed thinking can this kind of fire break through the divine blessing of mine I must have underestimated my opponent if I can't break through this binding does that mean I can only resort to that moo I absolutely cannot fall into that irreversible form unless it's absolutely necessary then yamus threw something to Diggin and commanded what are you standing there for frost Essence for you hurry up and help me Diggins caught it and laughed in Delight haha he also marveled inside brother thinks like a god this guy is trapped now system notification Frost Essence a divin level Rare Essence born along with the giant realm can enhance ice attributes Beyond imagination creatures with weak Vitality will be countered as they cannot withstand its freezing power please use with caution when the prey is trapped one can close the net Diggins turned his face laughed loudly ha so you have your day now weren't you very arrogant didn't you want a one on Three fight why can't you take it anymore do you want me to help it's too late now Hayes I'm just here to watch the show yamus in Rage shouted you dare to play me I don't care about this body anymore you all must die at this moment both yam's blood and power were depleted Glenn exclaimed the frost dragon is hasn't come to help her our luck is really good finally we can kill that gianti this time y Wu immediately countered it's not over yet what comes next is what matters right after that yamus transformed roaring now is your time to die death ray Frost will the death ray Frost will level 48 form appeared blood and strength overflowing Glenn was astonished this wraith form she had such a powerful move hit yamas charged forward swining her hand to strike y wo Glenn hurriedly warned quick Dodge if this form touches you your soul will be sucked away ye W remain calm leisurely saying Diggins it's your turn to act now Diggins conjured a sphere of power from his mouth I know brother with this Frost Essence I can absorb the Rai form of this woman without being harmed spiritual energy devour attack and infuriated yis ordered Diggin what are you doing you're listening to a human so you colluded to play me from the start stop it what has he given you I'll give you double stop now a Diggins replied seriously the bond of Brotherhood we share cannot be measured in money this old hag deserves to die Without Pity this statement left everyone shocked especially Glenn what how is this the frost Dragon who has always been arrogant and ever subdued is calling Yu brother what's going on Diggins first handed the frost Essence to Yu brother please accept this Frost Essence it can absorb the ice attribute magic of rates yiu took it and exclaimed as expected of a Divine artifact just holding this ice attribute makes me feel an ice cold chill Soul suppression it would indeed be a waste to keep it for myself I know someone who can unleash its full potential he said I know after settling everything ye W arrogantly left letun go Lord Glenn after picking up the equipment more important matters await us Glenn replied A hem understood Glenn thought V woo this guy truly makes it hard for me to keep a straight face his strength is indeed unfathomable what he refers to as more important matters is what system notification successfully defeated the boss received 50 million experience points 10 million gold Frost death neck that can summon the soul of the Dead to fight for you at an equivalent level the targets include all creatures with a soul but summing stronger Souls will consume more Frost Aura Frost ice Crown once worn can automatically absorb Frost Aura from the surrounding atmosphere it performs best when situated in icy snowy ground Frost Mast once worn can harmonize your energy with the environment but it must be an icy snowy ground to achieve 100% concealed efficiency at the same time it requires a large amount of frost Aura to be consumed ye W felt these pieces of equipment are entirely designed for my next steps but to use all the equipment inevitably requires Frost Aura what is this Diggins explained Frost Aura is a special magical power hidden within the atmosphere of the giant realm it is the energy source of our Giant and ice dragon Clan but you don't need to worry the frost Essence in your hand is a concentrated product of frost Aura thanks to it you can use these equipment infinitely Glenn said his Farewell our mission has been completed what we need to do now is return to the main city and wait for the defensive project of the main city to be repaired we will then return to Golden City but you woo what is your next plan y replied your mission is over but my mission has just begun he pointed into the distance do you see the Royal City giant over there that is the next station I must go to Glenn was stunned what Royal City giant he raised his voice do you know where that is y woo that is one of the most dangerous places in dangerous places it is God's forbidden zone and even gods do not dare to set foot there why you want to go there Yu thought to himself Glenn doesn't know about lokil and suto I cannot tell him the truth right now if I do with Glenn's righteous and purely innocent character he certainly wouldn't be able to cope with the cunning schemes ahead ye woo softly said said I know that place is very dangerous but I have my reasons I must go don't worry if I dare to go I will definitely find a way to avoid danger in the end Glenn had no choice but to accept if you insist on going I have no reason to stop you I will wait for you at the main city as support Yu raised his hand to Bid Farewell don't worry if the plan goes smoothly it won't take too much time I will return saying that y Wu WR Diggin and set off let's go Diggins Diggins let out a strong cry Roger no doubt about it brother the Royal City giant a place where even the ice dragon Clan doesn't dare to approach casually yet y wo says he will go Diggins thought to himself although I am still a bit scared as long as I am with my brother I have nothing to fear anymore Glenn smiled faintly as he watched Yu's figure grow distant he thought although gu Wu is hiding something from me he surely has his own reasons I completely trust his decision I hope he returns safely meanwhile y reminded himself before I sneak into the Royal City I have one important thing to do which is to locate loil first I cannot lever stab me in the back when I come to rescue Lord Thor the system announced currently yiu has identified two important positions one is Marilyn who is now in the realm of yam men the other is loil but her current position in the realm is still unclear ye who was stunned this means she is not in the two Realms that have been explored forget it as long as she doesn't obstruct my plan it's fine Diggin called out to ywu brother ahead is the Royal City giant I know you are very brave but as a brother I still have to remind you of one thing the reason the Royal City giant is dangerous is because it is located at the edge of the giant realm and the realm of death simultaneously drawing power from both realms Diggins continued the giant king in the Royal City has terrifying strength comparable to the power of zuen although he hasn't acted for over a thousand years I think his strength has only increased not decreased previously I boasted that I wasn't afraid of him but if I really had to face him I fear I would be nothing Yi Wu reassured him don't panic I definitely won't be foolish enough to confront the giant king directly I come to the Royal City for another purpose and will only win swiftly Diggins replied then I'm at ease brother standing before the Royal City giant y Wu thought to himself Diggins is not wrong this Royal City giant not only emanates a bone chilling coldness but also mixes with an energy that makes one feel suffocated but y Wu wore a mask changed his coat standing there mumbling with this Frost formless mask it can conceal my energy if I don't want to enter the Royal City it really would be a waste of effort to cover up the large door opened a towering figure appeared and a cold voice rang out who are you Nim the gatekeeper at level 700 with abundant strength and health asked why did you mude into the Royal City Y wo was at a loss for words wondering wdf isn't the mask supposed to completely conceal my energy but the outcome is that I was still discovered isn't a legendary gear insignificant in front of the Royal City Nim curiously asked asked M you carry no repulsive scent but instead emit a unique smell of the giant race could you be one of our giant race but why are you so short Yu suddenly understood hemp The Mask has transformed my energy into that of the giant race feww this is indeed a stroke of luck amidst Misfortune if so y Wu immediately knelt on one knee and declared your majesty is wise I was deemed a freak because of my stature and was expelled from my clan fortunately Lord Loi kindly raised me to become a person this time I am representing her to visit the Royal City to check on the maturation status of that thing Nim question isn't it true that she always comes alone Nim continued why send someone like you this time yiwu immediately replied lying without batting an eye because she had business to attend in the realm that's why I was sent Nim contemplated for a moment and ultimately decided to agree Mom I don't smell any lying energy on you come with me y Wu cautiously said thank you sir he glanced around wow it's so big this is my first time in the Royal City it's been a lifetime wish of mine Yu looked at Nim with admiration in his eyes I truly admire you sir for being able to hold the position of the gatekeeper of the Royal City you must be very strong right Nim warned in the Royal City it is forbidden to talk too much we've arrived he pointed to a door this is where that thing is but only L and the King know how to open it the king is currently asleep Nim lowered his voice if you were sent by Lil she must have told you how to open this door Nim named his spear at ywo his killing intent palpable either open it or die ywu fell Silent not responding suddenly several signals on the door lit up in sequence Yi Wu pretended to ask what are you talking about Sir Nim calmly replied of course I know how to open the door otherwise why would I come here ye woo silently sighed fortunately before controlling the time thread I paid attention to how Lil opened the door otherwise it would have been hard to avoid a fierce battle the door opened ye Wu deliberately asked Nim are you coming in with me my Lord Nim turned and walked away responding no need what's inside here is not something I can look at I'll wait for you outside the door the door Clos and ye wo breathed the sigh of relief few finally here if it work for so many methods I'd have been dead at least twice by now this door definitely can block all energy the next important thing was Lord Thor who was Shackled with both hands in one place yelling Hey kid the only ones I've met here are the giant old man and lock shial who are you to DARE come here looking at the energy on you you're from the giant race but I've never seen such a short giant before what do you want yiu raised his hand to hold his mask seeing you so spirited I can rest assured Lord Thor as for me Yu took off his mask and replied of course I'm here to save you Lord Thor was momentarily stunned this energy of yours are you immortal suto was tightly bound exhausted his eyes filled with fear he spoke in a trembling voice save me a mere mortal like you dares to speak loudly there's a super being here you can't even get close to me you're one of Lock's people right come here a toy with me if so then go back and tell her that I will definitely make her die a miserable death Yu ignored the harsh words and continued to approach suto panicked further his eyes clearly showing surprise and inwardly thought wait a minute is this Mortal really coming towards me I can sense a dense Aura of power emanating from his body this kid is he serious Yi Wu coldly looked at sulto his voice filled with authority he transformed and said if I say I will save you then I will save you but with your attitude I'm even less inclined to help you Hayes upon hearing this sulto turned pale and hurriedly shouted don't please I believe you I believe in you from your demeanor I can see your strength please save me quickly at that moment a notification echoed from the server warning warning using the account The Immortal Baldi poses a risk of Consciousness being devoured please be cautious yiu replied I know if it weren't for wanting to save you I really wouldn't want to use this account anymore he stepped closer to the man his head shining in his mind he thought in the end I can only take a gamble this once can the Divine artifact that the dwarf gave me help eliminate the side effects of the immortal Baldi status the system explained further the Divine artifact is supported by Sis's long Golden Hair combined with divine power helping to attach the hair to the scalp enabling a fusion that allows for Eternal growth and prevents hair loss after completing the process the system announced the emo status The Immortal baly has been dispelled restoring The Majestic appearance from before regaining enthusiasm for life and feeling full of energy the system explained when excited everything you see becomes interesting and fresh and very attributes increase significantly after the hair transplant Yi Wu happily shouted aha this is so exciting everything I see becomes interesting this feeling I haven't experienced it in a long time then he walked towards the gate speaking as he went after being emo for countless years now I want to activate the serious State sulto asked based on your own knowledge can you resist the superdimension cube pollution well done but if you want to save me You Must Destroy the device that is holding me captive what do you plan to do he drew the hammer using his ultimate skill with a resounding bang he said of course it must be done he struck the gate with the hammer and exclaimed no wonder it's a weapon of the Gods just touching it I can feel the dense lightning power operating within interesting interesting from inside solto hurt the other person using joner to save him and quickly raised his voice to intervene if you and tend to use my joler to save me I advise you to abandon that plan not to mention that it is currently being suppressed by the super Q in the nine Realms besides me and the old man no one else can will it a mere mortal like you absolutely cannot ye woo upon hearing this immediately asked back what are you talking about just then the gate was broken down the blond haired man saw it and gaped in astonishment oh my God how is it possible how can a mortal wield my Divine weapon wait a minute the charm of mjolner cannot be resisted could it be that he won't return it and will just escape with the hammer seeing Solo's panicked expression he asked what's with that look on your face like I'm planning to take your hammer or something don't worry I won't waste the treasures of Heaven like that this Hammer can only reach its greatest value in your hands he heard this and took up the hammer praising y woo I admit I've underestimated you you're quite something kid regardless of character or strength this is my affirmation Thunder God ancestor Yu looked at the cube and thought this Cube indeed comes from the outer God deep in the sky it is absorbing the power of the land of giants the realm of death and mjolner is developing rapidly moreover this energy is similar to the pollution that has invaded the St mold could it be that the fragment comes from the super micro cube he prepared to strike the cube thinking to himself destroy it at that moment a girl emerged from a tunnel and upon seeing y woo she said oh I never expected someone could enter the Royal City of giants moreover it's a handsome and powerful person a man with your strength truly captivates me are you the righteous messenger coming to save solto by the way my name is logel a God and I'm also here to save solto solto saw her and shouted loudly preparing to swing the hammer don't be seduced by that crazy woman she is lying she is the one who imprisoned me here she's best at deceitful schemes especially seduction someone like you won't be able to handle her let me deal with her Solo's Hammer struck hard against Lil's face but she only lost a little blood seeing this solto immediately grabbed her and shouted you Wicked girl I told you before didn't I when I regain my freedom I will definitely make you pay a terrible price after saying that he slammed Lil down onto the ground however right right after that she completely disappeared sulto stood in shock realizing he had fallen into a trap and rage he roared she's up to her tricks again outside two people were observing the situation one of them spoke up it seems that solto has been corrupted by the cubic virus deep in the sky he's gone mad I shouldn't leave this Cube and go somewhere else to avoid further contamination solto you were both handsome and Valiant this matter is up to you to deal with all right inside solto was still furiously destroying everything around him he bellowed Wicked girl if you're skilled stop running come here and fight me face to face yiu slowly approached suto upon seeing him sulto angrily shouted danet the more beautiful the woman the better she knows how to lie don't believe a word she says or you'll die I will beat you to death yiu calmly replied of course I don't believe her I have seen through all her deceit tricks and schemes long ago hearing this solto was astonished fellow friend have you also been Charmed by her it's a Pity that you let her Escape y wo quickly reassured don't worry she can't escape as long as I know her ultimate goal I will find a way to stop her from activating the time control device the server announced time has returned to the designated Point set by the host suto said she ran again the system notified activated the the 10th time rewind suto remarked she ran again what good is your method the system notified activated the 100 time rewind time has returned to the host's designated point for the 100 time at that moment y swam a punch at lockal she merely smiled haha you told him to subdue Salto so why are you throwing punches at me never mind I will take my leave someone bigger will come to play with you having said that she van Yoo Furious exclaimed damn it no matter how far back in time I go Lil always has various tricks up her sleeve to cope and escape with the queue her godlevel Escape skills truly make it impossible for me to predict it seems I have to change my strategy a voice echoed guardian of the Royal City Nim how is it letting a mouse slip in at that moment a figure appeared laf stepped in coldly saying you filthy mortal you have overstepped your bounds this place is not a realm where lowly beings like you can tread thong he continued prepare to welcome death suto rushed towards laf shouting loudly Ross giant king laf you conspired with Lil I must defeat you for Revenge laf immediately criticized son of Austine Lord Thor solto compared to the father of the Gods you are too Reckless before challenging a king do you not have the necess AR respect and etiquette sulto retorted instantly one Blow from joler Thor is the greatest respect I have for you having said that he swung the hammer violently to attack laf however laf blocked it with his hand he angrily said hemp I never expected the title of the god of lies and schemes of lock Shield to be so easily seen through but fine I originally wanted to declare war on your father so let's start by killing his son first gathered a large amount of power and then shot it straight towards sulto coldly declaring today you will definitely not survive to leave my Royal City sulto quickly used a skill to resist that enormous power he shouted in Anger you talk too much giant today I want to see who will be the one to die after a while a loud explosion occurred blowing everything away Yu excitedly exclaimed this is the battle between the highlevel God and the giant king just a bit of the residual might from these two sources of power colliding is equivalent to a nuclear explosion exciting truly exciting fighting at this level makes the blood in my veins boil at this moment yiwu was filled with exhilaration he was ready to charge into the battle alongside the two he wanted to take it seriously for once because with such a magnificent sight how could he possibly be absent but before Yu could finish his words he was unexpectedly transported to another another space he panicked why have I been teleported out of Royal City giant could it be that before he could speculate an angry voice rang out as the gatekeeper of Royal City who has never failed I let myself be deceived by a little bug like you damn it truly damn it you will experience the agony of your body and soul being torn apart by me it turned out that it was the gatekeeper of Royal city named Nim without giving ywu a chance to react Nim summoned his Undead he shouted loudly come forth Warriors of the spirit who died for Royal City I command you to continue fighting immediately two giant Undead named tangmo and goui appeared one of them laughed hardly haha just waking up and already there's a fresh Body and Soul waiting for us this is truly a gift from the king the other chimed in aha this kid is so scared he can't even speak it's a bit disappointing Yu smeared his voice full of sarcasm scared and trembling no way it's just that I'm so excited I'm shaking even if you two are merely two lumps of stone condense from Undead energy I find the thought of Smashing you to bits quite entertaining with that ye W lunge forward punching off the heads of both Giants watching this Nim felt a bit of admiration for Yu but still laughed contemptuously without using any weapons or magic just relying on your physical strength to kill my giant Undead it seems you're quite confident in the strength of your body then next how long can you endure against the creature once favored by the king the strest Beast of the land of giants who was once slain by Augustine haha a fierce Beast suddenly appeared staring at y Wu and growling threateningly Yi Wu immediately knocked it out in an instant looking at the Beast lying motionless he found it quite interesting but still didn't feel satisfied Nim stood there panic-stricken unable to believe what he had just witnessed fenr fenr y Wu with his glowing red eyes stepped toward Nim you can control this thing which proves Your Own Strength is quite formidable right come here I hope you can make me feel a little more excited sweat poured down Nim's forehead as he quickly retreated and slammed the Royal City door shut in his mind he was confused who would dare to fight him even the ultimate move couldn't challenge him this guy's strength is nearly at the King L fortunately the large door of the Royal City is sturdy enough even atine couldn't break through just by closing the door I am safe suddenly yiwu charged trade in delivering a punch that shattered the large door he smiled his gaze icy don't run we haven't fought yet why are you running you were acting so imposing before what about now saying it disappears just like that Nim terrified shouted how is that possible a door this big before he could finish y Wu launched a series of punches at him Nim could only Retreat his initial momentum Vanishing Without a Trace didn't you say if you couldn't open the Secret Door you would have to die y wo scoffed didn't you say you wanted to tear me apart why are you so quiet now y Wu continued the result is only this a bit disappointing he screamed in pain ah is the power at this level really that of a mortal what kind of monster are you I have tried my hardest in the end y Wu also defeated Nim the system immediately announced you have successfully captured Frost giant king Nim into ice Essence as Frost giant king Nim has collected many frost creature Undead the frost Essence obtained a large amount of frost AA reserves hearing this yiu was delighted and said this time I bought one and got so much truly interesting on the side of suto he was almost defeated damn it I have been out of the Golden City for too long the divine power in my body is almost depleted only relying on jonner Thor can I hold on until now while the giant king on his territory can replenish strength almost endlessly this time it's Troublesome laf immediately charged towards solto he raised his fist and shouted Lil's plan is not without some success at least it has weakened a nuisance only second to Augustine allow allowing me to easily kill suddenly Yu rushed towards them at such a crucial moment how can I be absent he immediately equipped the god- breaking gauntlets which could shatter space randomly laf immediately deflected Yu's attack you are still alive this proves you have defeated Nim that useless piece of trash clearly I bestowed upon him a very powerful Divine weapon yiu smiled and replied is what you speak of the lamp in his hand indeed it is quite interesting but not powerful enough laf exclaimed in astonishment so you have encountered my deathly love Hound I must admit you were stronger than I expected your strength in a mortal is truly rare it's just a Pity that on my territory you stand no chance of winning in the distance solto observed the two fighting full of surprise behind the giant king cracks in the Beast Essence keep appearing can ye W truly generate Beast Essence with this strikes is this something a mortal can achieve but then sulto muttered helplessly but it's useless each time I make him bleed he absorbs the frost and death energy to heal what more can I do just as sulto finished speaking L gathered energy and fully recovered he arrogantly shouted I told you on my territory no one can defeat me Austine also looked at ywu calmly saying the strength of your body truly exceeds my expect ations but as long as I trap you in Eternal Eastern soil you were sure to lose he immediately rushed towards y Wu now this final punch is the Frozen coffin for you to have a good sleep yiu also charged forward and shouted loudly I know you're constantly healing that's why I have to use this method to fight you right after that a fireball appeared behind laf it seemed like my opportunity had finally come saying that I immediately pushed in towards the Fireball and yelled I want to see who will be turned into ice first you or will you melt away due to the temperature of this planet La remained oblivious and mocked V woo a mortal I really overestimated you thinking you could use illusion to deal with me do you really think this kind of Illusion can trick me y Wu scoffed in reply whether it's an illusion or not you just feel it with your Thousand-Year frozen body at soon as LA's body touched the fireball it immediately began to melt he panicked and thought wildly wait why is my body melting isn't this an illusion could it be that Loi ran away to leave me with this Troublesome opponent then he immediately shouted to negotiate with yiu he believed that both he and Yi Wu had been deceived by Lil so there was no need to fight recklessly seeing that yiu had no intention of letting him go laf hurriedly suggested as long as you are willing to spare me I promise I will never invade the Divine realm again Treasures power rights of of mine whatever you want I will give you all ye will immediately refuse you say that now but all I want is to kill you laf was Furious constantly shouting this madman we have no grudges against each other both being exploited by loio why do you have to capture me like this do you want me to die fine but don't think you can live either let's die together in the heat of this star Yu pushed him hard into the fireball coldly saying who wants to die with you a bit of warmth like this is no different for me than soaking in a hot spring laf astonished shouted how is that possible with a mortal body how can you stand firm on this star what on Earth are you in the end he was completely consumed by the Fireball the system immediately announced successfully killed the boss received two billion experience after the system updated the collected rewards y Wu immediately check the list of items Frost King's beheading axe weapon of the frost giant king concentrates the power of the enemies defeated by ywu Shield of absolute godlevel equipment carries the power of wind when used increases evasion by 30% and movement speed by 30% cloak of winter godlevel equipment harnesses the power of Winter Wind increases evasion by 30% and speed by 30% when worn seeing these items yiu could not hide his Joy shouting no wonder they call him the K of frost giant all top tier equipment dropped at that moment the system suddenly displayed a warning alert alert due to hair damage the suppression power of the immortal Balby account is about to appear please quickly exit the current account hearing this yiwu suddenly became anxious he thought to himself this is not good Si's long Golden Hair can't withstand the heat from this star if it gets burned into a Baldhead again this dominant account might really be rendered useless then Yi Wu immediately flew towards the core of the account even though he was moving away from this star his hair continued to burn under the radiation of this star and he felt he had to quickly lead this place he needed to return to the current account as soon as Yi Wu approached the core of the account he noticed it was shrinking rapidly and was about to disappear he felt like he no longer had time suddenly yiu noticed something very bright near the core of of the account he immediately flew closer and discovered it was Sons mjolner Thor the moment y Wu grasped mjolner Thor he instantly returned to the original account I'm back suto did you save me how did you manage to do that clearly we are in different accounts and the account crack has already closed sulto smirked and said haha aren't I clever seeing the entrance to the account close I bravely acted with Ingenuity and threw the hammer because no matter where I'm gner Thor is in any time War account I can Summit back in an instant it's just that this move consumes an enormous amount of energy I've used almost all of my remaining divine power this feeling is really unpleasant y Wu immediately instructed the system to escape from The Immortal baly account then reached out towards suto he smiled and said thank you suto for saving me solto clasped hands with Y woo and excitedly said I should really thank you because you sake me first and you also dealt with my God's greatest enemy all right starting today Yu you are officially my brother Lord Thor suto and the only mortal I fully acknowledge suddenly the ground shook violently and a growling sound echoed from somewhere Yu was confused unsure what that sound was he suspected It Came from Beneath the Earth sulto immediately shouted a warning to yiu not good the giant sleeping beneath Royal City has awakened it must be because of the giant kingk death which has loosened their powers binding after saying that suto slumped to the ground helpless damn it I'm exhausted right now the high God's weapon can directly open a portal to the Golden City but unfortunately I no longer have enough divine power to open the portal y wo immediately spoke up then we only have the way back to the main city at the front checkpoint leaving through the ship's entrance there I came that way before sulto silently thought I am just a bird to you as I have exhausted all my energy then sulto stood up walked toward the Giants and shouted V woo you go ahead I will fight these guys with everything I have even though I am exhausted I still have the strength to deal with these rocks Yu chuckled and said now is not the time for heroics then the system immediately switched to the ace pilot account sham Hulu solto was puzzled as to where Yu suddenly got such a large chunk of metal Yu replied no time to explain get in the plane I'll take you flying after that the two got into the plane and took off sulto exclaimed in amazement wwoo you are truly incredible the speed of this iron bird is about to catch up with father of gods eight light divorce at the giant realm jotunheimr the commander of the god Watchtower the Marshall God noticed an unfamiliar object flying towards them and immediately reported to Glenn Lord Glenn there is something approaching at high speed over there could it be a new Ambush Glenn immediately ordered them to prepare for battle suddenly he sensed a familiar energy from that aircraft and instructed all the Valkyries to prepare to pay their respects as soon as solto stepped off the plane Glenn spoke up Lord Thor your highness you have been missing for so long it brings us great joy to see you return safely solto said this matter must be thanked to Yu for he saved me Glenn immediately turned to thank Yu w d woo so you took the risk of going to the Royal City giant to save Lord Thor you have fulfilled the responsibility that was supposed to be ours on behalf of all the Valkyries I extend my sincerest gratitude to you yugu replied now is not the time for thanks because this matter is not over yet saying that he pointed behind him and explained seriously the frost giant king is dead without his control these crazed Frost Giants will continue to attack the main Watchtower their numbers may be great but if we destroy the main Watchtower we can trap them here preventing them from ever invading the Divine realm the guards overheard Yu's words and immediately rebutted what destroy the main Watchtower how many casualties have we suffered to hold this place and now you want us to just abandon it the frost giant king is dead are you joking do you think I will believe you that's right the soldiers guarding the main Watchtower won't act at all based on what should we listen to a mortal like you just because you say we should abandon it does that mean we will solto angrily shouted is it your turn to spout nonsense here if even he doesn't have the qualifications then who does everyone listen carefully to me Yu's opinion is my command if anyone dares to be discontent I'll throw him out for the Giants to feed on the guards hearing this became flustered and quickly complied understood understood Lord Thor please calm down we will immediately follow Master Yu's orders at the main checkpoint of the god City the monsters were attacking while shouting get out here you dogs of God I will chop you up into pieces another one laughed loudly mocking haha it seems those cowardly ghosts have all run away what else can they brag about that the main checkpoint will never fall is that all they have they continued to shout it's the perfect time to use the teleportation gate in this main city and kill all the way Divine realm I will definitely twist oas's head off to avenge arcan however before the plan was completed a loud explosion suddenly rang out they panicked and yelled it's a trap this is a trap Retreat quickly inside the city hurried footsteps echoed in Golden City inside the Holy Temple the gods were talking excitedly look is that Lord Thor is it really Thor hasn't he been missing for a long time they were discussing among the themselves next to him is Immortal that is the person whom the god of creation specially allowed to enter the Holy Temple last time who would have thought that something like this would happen solto slung an arm around Yu and walked in a bright expression on his face the people around couldn't help but murmur Lord Thor seems to be very close to that mortal am I not mistaken Lord Thor who is always been arrogant is now interacting so familiarly suto ignored the gossip and boldly deed declared old man I finally come back a deity shouted sulto where have you gone this time why have you been missing for so long I thought you were dead suto quickly replied father you're still as serious as ever this time I wasn't missing in a usual way rather I was trapped by a rotten woman she secretly colluded with the frost Giants King and imprisoned me deep within the Royal City of ice and Bone he continued fortunately yeu saved me not only that but he also killed the frost Giants King resolving a major hassle for us the whole uncontrolled bunch of frost Giants was also dealt with thanks to his clever plan to wipe them out thus we cannot treat him poorly a deity nodded of course thanks to my Divine wisdom and strength ye W stay to help our Gods you speak the truth the gods could not help but be alarmed upon hearing this news one of them exclaimed what am I hearing this wrong is it Lord who has imprisoned Lord Thor another one spoke up this is hard to believe loil being one of the most noble Gods how could he harm Lord Thor who is also a master right there was someone in the group who raised a question what is the background of this Mortal that he possesses such Celestial abilities sulto overhearing their words was filled with rage he pointed directly at the two people who were talking and shouted scolding are you doubting me am I still lying the the two stood there seeing Lord Thor react in such a way instantly felt afraid one replied no we wouldn't dare the other added our father I think I might have some insights as well sulto turned to Y wo and asked I have set people searching everywhere yet cannot find the whereabouts of Thor Yu how did you manage to locate him the other gods below began to discuss again one of them could not help but exclaim no wonder he is the father of Gods one phrase and it hits the mark another God continued to question we the Gods Know Nothing of Lord Thor's whereabouts what does this Mortal named Yu rely on to possess this knowledge finally a curious God speculated could it be that he is a spy controlled by LEL acting as a double agent between the gods and the frost Giants thereby helping loil achieve some goal hearing this suto turned to ywu and asked quietly vwo it's not that I about you but what God just said does make sense how did you know I was trapped in the Royal SE giant I know you were not ordinary you must have used some special means but you should explain to everyone to avoid misunderstandings yiu calmly replied now that it has come to this I will no longer conceal it but what I am about to say next you all must prepare yourselves sulto asked back confuse prepare ourselves prepare for what after a few minutes of silence solto suddenly shouted unable to believe what ye wo are you saying you can control time a murmur arose with another voice following up moreover you even come from the other world and you've prophesied the destruction of the God Realm and the dust God destroying the nine Realms this is really hard to believe Stop scaring people here controlling time even a deity can't do that let alone the Mortal like you and about prophesying the destruction of God and the nine realms with the father of God Eternal here the nine Realms will forever be safe and sound ye woo patiently continued I have not only seen the sunset of God but I have also witnessed the demise of Lord Thor and father of God if we leave it unattended for too long this outcome is likely to occur hearing this the group became Furious shouting incredible a mere mortal dares to utter such words you absolutely lack the capability you are clearly presiding over over lord Thor and father of god father of God I implore you to punish this moral upon hearing this ye W immediately stood up and shouted silence be quiet all of you one Al among them spoke up Le woo if your abilities are genuine then you surely know where liis is right now another person agreed even if what this moral says is true Lil being the goddess of schemes and deceit if she wishes to hide no one can find her the elite one nodded in agreement indeed ever since the Path of Radiance was destroyed even father of God is unclear about the whereabouts of God how could a moral possibly know he confidently crossed his arms and replied of course I know back when I was at Royal City giant I traveled back in time 100 times while I let luls take the superv virus Cube and run away I also discovered that in those 100 times she always ran in the same direction into the realm of Blazing flames hearing this information everyone couldn't help but be stunned sulto quickly said what is it that place that's somewhere our Gods absolutely cannot step foot in how can it be there this time it's a hassle the father of God understood something and immediately ordered Gods hear my command from now on the God Realm is to enter a state of battle Readiness the entire area on high alert all the gods answered the order loudly ye Wu turned to tto and asked Gods seem very afraid of that place are they really that scared sulto replied as a mortal it's normal for you not to know that realm is the Fire Nation in the nine reals situated in Eternal extreme heat as he spoke sulto began to imagine that place he continued the realm of Blazing Flames has been a forbidden land for Gods since the creation and it is also a place where Gods cannot set foot at the same time this is the domain of the giant king turu Yu continued thousands of years ago when the old man was still young he was at his Peak leading the forces of the entire Divine realm but EV barely managed to defeat turu sulto continued his face becoming serious in fact from the very beginning of creation father received the prophecy of the Twilight of the god everyone knows this day will come but no one knows when the condition to open the Twilight of the god is related to the realm of blazing Flames which is why everyone is so anxious after listening Yu understood and replied so that's it a God has an opinion father of God in the nine Realms only the realm of Blazing Flames is a place where our gods have never set foot there is also no stronghold of ours there so who should we send to capture ler after all even a God cannot withstand the heat of the realm of Blazing Flames sulto agreed with this perspective and replied that's right even I cannot last half an hour there so old man definitely do not sent me the father of God was helpless and speechless just then ye Wu's eyes lit up saying I'll go us humans are not afraid of heat it lies where warmth accumulates the gods were taken aback and mocked what this Mortal dares to raise his voice now not stopping there they continue to discuss y woo he truly knows nothing the realm of Blazing Flames is a place that even Lord Thor does not dare to enter he will be incinerated within a second another countered but he can manipulate time and even defeated the frost giant king perhaps he has some special tricks who knows he might actually succeed the father of gods remained silent for a long time then spoke as he walked letun discuss this matter later he turned to suto and yiu you two come with me to the treasure Vault suto happily draped his arm around ywu laughing it seems the old man has acknowledged and trust your abilities he wants to reward you this is the first time he's been so generous yiu was equally pleased and replied if he is so sincere I won't be polite a thought flashed through his mind I didn't expect to use this method to enter the treasure Vault this time I must boldly take something significant to make up for the regrets of the past at that moment in the Treasure Vault of Augustine there stood a gigantic tree with shining Golden Leaves suto looked at yiu smirking with satisfaction kid today you are considered very lucky the old man took the initiative to lead you to his treasure throughout my life I can count on one hand the number of times I've been allowed in here Yi wo equally delighted laughed and replied really Austine frowned reminding solto don't say such nonsense he turned to Yu speaking gently y woo to thank you for saving solos and and exposing ler evil scheme I permit you to choose two items at Will from The Divine artifacts hidden here sulto immediately showed a confused expression pouting and his father dad that's a bit biased the items here you don't even let me touch normally yet now you're giving y Wu two items yiwu's eyes lit up unable to hide his happiness he responded if you are that generous I have no reason to refuse suto let out a cunning laugh patting y woo on the shoulder and saying vwoo let this big brother choose for you I guarantee I will help you pick two top tier artifacts that will make the old man vomit blood after saying that the two stood before the treasure Vault admiring the Divine artifacts that were shining brightly sulto pointed to a gigantic sword speaking in a serious tone this sword of Victory originally belonged to a powerful God after he perished the sword was stored here it falls under the special category of divine sword he chuckled continuing this sword has the ability to automatically lock onto targets and Strikes with extreme sharpness and power what do you say are you interested Yu Shrugged in reply if suto doesn't fancy this sword then let's swap it with another both of them shifted their gaze to another gigantic sword around the sword powerful arcs of electricity flickered incessantly creating a sense of majesty and danger sulto spoke up to introduce if we say the sword of Victory is a weapon imbued with brilliant light then this turfing is a demonic blade steeped in darkness and Malice its attacking power is greater than that of Victory but once drawn from its sheath it must be stained with fresh blood otherwise it will turn against its wielder and consume them ywu smirked casually commenting that's rather Sinister but compared to these two swords I prefer a different sword with that both of them looked up at another sword the sword King it radiated a colossal source of power but did so without ostentation quietly spreading A peculiar Divine aura that captivated those who beheld it sulto was astonished pointing at the sword the sword came why have I never seen it before is this a new item your father has kept he thought to himself on the outside it looks ordinary but the Divine Essence it emanates is indeed surprising turning to his father sulto asked what is the origin of this sword Austine remains Silent not answering merely frowning slightly his gaze lingering on the sword King ye wo chuckled softly thinking to himself it seems the God has specially kept this sword can in his treasury he must be quite pleased with it but I'm sorry I have my eyes set on it he pointed at the sword and asked I want this sword is that okay Augustine closed his eyes sighed and then with regret said this Treasure of mine contains many precious items yet you chose this sword I also like it very much but once I have made a promise I cannot go back on my word take it the sword King is originally an item created by you consider in a return to its owner yiu stepped forward and carefully took the sword sulto standing beside him exclaimed in astonishment what this sword was made by you kid you are truly amazing you are skilled even in weapon forging there are not many Treasures that can make my father show such a reluctant expression let me borrow it to take a look saying that suto snatched the sword from Yu's hand at that moment the sword began to slowly dissolve its form changing in a wondrous way in the blink of an eye it transformed into a gigantic axe surrounded by powerful arcs of electricity sulto was astonished raising the axe high and feeling the strange power emanating from it he said this sword can change into to the type of weapon that suits my attributes even though I have never used an axe why does it feel so familiar furthermore this axe releases power that is no less than my hammer truly amazing Augustine looked at solto with a calm voice don't get too engrossed with it Yu you have one more Divine artifact to choose from go ahead Yu nodded but his gaze lingered on a massive black stone tablet placed in the corner of the treasure chamber after a brief contemplation he looked up and asked before I choose I have a question what is that huge black stone tablet I am very curious about it pointing at the black board filled with strange symbols he thought to himself you brought this here before I arrived you must have noticed it it looks just like a fragment from a black stone that once existed in my world the only difference is that this board is complete Austine explained this is called the world Stone it appeared at the same time as creation recording all information and rules of the world your world does not have this yeu wondered since it is called a recording of the world could it be related to the origin while he was lost in thought Augustine suddenly reminded him suto have you played enough hurry up and return the sword King to Yu did you think I would know your thoughts sulto sheepishly replied you saw through it he then returned the sword Yu placed his hand on the sword quietly thinking if the world Stone can record the information and rules of the world then the rumors about restarting the world are not without Foundation previously the hanmo group collected these fragments did they know its true purpose or was there another goal I need to investigate this clearly after returning suddenly a circle of blinding light appear on the world Stone suddenly the system announced an extraordinary Divine artifact has been detected reacting to the account plane Watcher the account has been automatically activated y Wu was surprised silently thinking this abnormal Aura can automatically activate the account how strange the system continued to notify the plane Watcher determines that this Aura comes from the Demonic plane it has the ability to activate the transmission door to the demon realm only demons can enter therefore it is very Wicked please avoid this object host ye who picked up a red gemstone quietly pondering the demon realm can only be entered by demons quite interesting but isn't this a coincidence one of the skills of my demonic Wings is the ability to freely Traverse the demon Dimensions so all of this is not a coincidence but fate suto approached curiously asking what's wrong are you interested in this gem this demon blood Jade is indeed very strange although it carries a tremendous demonic power inside until now no one knows how to use it Frankly Speaking it can only be looked at not used y Wu replied nonchalant is that so he held the gem stone out in front and asked may I take this one sulto was surprised asking back ha do you really want to take this what are you thinking there are so many Treasures but you choose this one Augustine nodded slightly his gaze serious as he looked at ywo he said all right the two Treasures I promised you are ready next I want to discuss a a few serious matters his voice became calm yet weighty the schemes and betrayals of locker are matters internal to our divine race as the God she knows the strengths and weaknesses of each member of the clan however it is surprising that despite her intricate calculations she could not foresee the emergence of an unexpected Factor like you in the end she placed all her hopes on a moral from another world I sincerely apologize for this but I hope you understand that even as the Ala father I cannot accomplish everything there are matters beyond my reach nonetheless regardless of your true intentions your willingness to assist our divine race is commendable on behalf of the Divine race thank you thank you for all you have done solo stood nearby arms crossed an uncomfortable expression on his face father what's with that gentle expression of yours I've never seen you like this I am your son you have never treated me this way and dare to say you are not biased yigu smiled faintly not paying attention to Solo's complaints he replied his tone calm Yet full of implications it's all right this is the arrangement of Fate the most important thing is that Locker has bound her fate of emity with me therefore I will not easily let go looking up at the sky Yu said in a deep voice I plan to reorganize and then set off to the realm of Blazing Flames Austin replied when the time comes I will personally take you there sulto reminded father don't overexert yourself no matter how strong you are you can only withstand the high temperatures of the realm of Blazing Flames for at most 1 hour suddenly Glenn and vachile rushed over in a panic Glenn out of breath said how father and Lord Thor I have urgent news to report aistin frowned and asked what has happened Glenn replied next please allow Valkyrie vachel to explain clearly vachile knelt down in salute and then seriously reported an hour ago I saw Yu Master with Valkyrie Maryland leaving the city of gold given their previous relationship I didn't think much of it but when I clarified this with Glenn I learned that the yiu was an impostor he tricked Valkyrie Marilyn away Yu was taken a and asked what suto curiously interjected tricking the valkyrie away is this the kind of good deed laer would do but Marilyn is merely a new Valkyrie what's the benefit of tricking her away yiu responded seriously it's not what you think Marilyn is the key to this world she will determine the ultimate fate of this world then he gritted his teeth in Anger everyone was astonished and asked what is it y was worried could it be that ler has discovered the importance of Marilyn damn it the systems time control mechanism failed to lock ler I have to prevent her from getting close to Maryland the system announced locking failed target loer has disappeared from the timeline in the present world do you want to continue using time control you who wondered disappeared from the timeline could it be that my ability has been exposed could it be because I used the timeline reset in the current world that she discovered this is a bit Troublesome y Wu thought to himself if I can't locate lock here then the system should use the time control mechanism to lock Marilyn she's the most important one the system announced locking failed Target Marilyn has disappeared from the timeline in the present World ywu panicked and asked Marilyn has also disappeared from the timeline damn it it must be that Locker used a similar trick to hide maryn Locker truly lives up to the moniker of a God of cunning this move was calculated then I will return to the time before I came back from the giant King City starting to keep an eye on Maryland from then on notification system this plan is feasible but we'll encounter bugs because laier and Marilyn have completely vanished from the current timeline although their disappearance can be understood as hidden or dead ler himself still exists in the current SpaceTime however ler and Marilyn have been severed from this world's timeline by a force greater than themselves the current timeline no longer encompasses the existence of the two after that a blinding light appeared forming the new timeline the system reminded if you go back it means opening a new timeline not returning to the the existing timeline in the new timeline the mission to prevent Valkyrie from falling will only achieve 50% Effectiveness significantly reducing the crazed slaughtered debuff of The Valkyrie account however the outcome will still be mediocre only by completing the final mission in the main timeline can a perfect result be attained completely eliminating the debuff of the account allowing Valkyrie to restore her Divine form ye W thought determined no matter how much effort it takes to reach this point I absolutely cannot stop Midway and choose a mediocre outcome even if the difficulty increases I must complete the final mission in the main timeline to achieve the perfect result thinking of this he clenched his fists and shouted oh Father Of Gods please take me immediately to the realm of Blazing flames and silently thought even if laer leads Maryland to disappear from the threat of time they might still be in the realm of Blazing Flames having to fight a life and death battle with Locker there moments later they arrived at the center of the earth the realm of Blazing flames in this cave was filled with molten lava suddenly a voice rang out you're awake at this moment ler was disguised as ywo looking around Marilyn called out to Yu she looked around in confusion and asked yiu where is this also when did I faint Locker pretended to gently answer my darling the great deep space hypercube in Giant Realms battle sense the extraordinary power radiating from you that's why I came to find you at this point she placed her hand on her cheek and smiled softly she turned around cunningly and said unlike that boring old God powerless against the fate of the Twilight of the Gods all it knows is to follow the will of Heaven my treasure it will help me guide me save me the fate of everyone is in your in my hands then she extended her hand to tempt Marilyn you were destined for greatness do do not be held captive by the gods becoming their tool you must live for yourself so abandon your identity as a valkyrie join me in resisting the gods then we will soar together Marilyn was filled with Dread wondering why is ye who saying such strange things he is different from usual too unusual could it be that he has been influenced by some kind of monster worried she called out V woo wake up this is not you you are not like this don't let that Cupid chck you at that moment ler was still in yuu's form gently touching her chin calmly replying no need to worry Marilyn you don't need to think so much saying that she moved closer her voice soft but full of intent didn't you say you like me a lot just do as I say and you will be fine I won't harm you Marilyn was taken AB quickly realizing the odity she immediately pushed ler away her eyes filled with suspicion asking bluntly you're not y woo Who are you at this moment ler revealed her true form her face full of mockery you really are so stubborn Marilyn whether I use the deep space Cube to corrupt you or exploit your feelings for y Wu to control you it would all be useless Marilyn stared directly at Locker her face igniting with rage she declared so it turns out you are pretending to be ywu God of lies and trickery ler l sheer snickered lightly but before she could say anything Marilyn continued firmly yes I like y wo but I am not an idiot no matter how you are the god of trickery you could never mimic Yu's special Aura suddenly a powerful source of light appeared the brightness so dazzling that it enveloped the entire space gradually the light transformed into the figure of a man Majestic and strong he coldly said if you don't listen to me then there's no need to waste any more time I will directly break this Aura and seize the power of the outer God within your body even if I lose a portion of my strength it doesn't matter your abundant power will definitely help Advance our plan by a significant step lir turned to him Hub tightly and gently replied I will listen to you completely my darling after that statement she suddenly took her Spear and ruthlessly pierced through Marilyn sending her flying far away Marilyn in pain struggled to grasp the spear think thinking to herself so fast I couldn't react is this the power of a god nevertheless she still fought back with all her strength holding tightly to the spear but ler looked at her with contempt and softly said the power within her body belongs to you completely my darling saying that ler bent down and kissed the man deeply as if to affirm her absolute loyalty elsewhere Yu had arrived at the center of the realm of Blazing Flames he gazed in amazement at the surroundings and muttered no wonder they call him the father of gods even though there is no main city here I can be directly brought to the central area through the Blazing realm Augustine standing beside him said in a steady voice this is not a difficult feat my divine power is enough to Encompass and resist the heat of this place but why did you choose to rush directly into the center Yi Wu explained instead of searching around like a fly it's better to directly ask the master of this place this way we be more effective and quicker a moment later the fiery giant Kain turu appeared he ferociously asked Augustine do you dare come to my domain have you forgotten the non-aggression pact we established 10,000 years ago for the past 10,000 years I have always adhered to The Pact yet now you break it do you intend to declare war on me suddenly yiu was enveloped by a wave of dark purple Power he calmly replied no need to be Hasty we came here to find Locker in your realm she is hiding in God don't you know where she is just then the system sounded a notification account the Blazing Emperor is under a temperature exceeding the standard receive limited buff the ultimate blazing dance this buff temporarily upgrades to level 999 but only works in the realm of Blazing Flames one of the Giants surrounding them roared in Anger this mere moral dares to provoke our King tired of living are we let's see if I can roast you into a pig to eat however this group of giants was insufficient to disturb y wo with a single strike he meatly eradicated them all aminee calmly said I did not come here and Declare War I only want Lo here to show herself if she appears we will leave immediately but it seems she is not here the fiery giant king laughed loudly his voice dripping with sarcasm you can't even manage your own subordinates and dare to come to my domain to demand someone Austine are you so old that you've become senile moreover do you think this blazing domain is a place for others to hide Austine raised the weapon in his hand his gaze cold as he replied your failure to directly deny it proves she is here call her out now otherwise I will kill you once more and this time there will be no feelings left the fiery giant king showed no fear his eyes filled with murderous intent as he said the wound you left me Augustine is something I will never forget for the rest of my life even after countless years that pain still aches reminding me that the time for my revenge has come Austin turned to ywo his voice steady but filled with urgency I will hold him off to buy time you must quickly find locker and Marilyn hurry Yi Wu immediately agreed and leaked away in his mind he could still sense the intense murderous intent emanating from the fiery giant king he silently thought could the matter between Augustine and him have anything to do with the Twilight of the Gods well this is not the time to think about that just as Yu moved the fiery giant king roared have I Let You Go he prepared to attack yiwu but Augustine immediately blocked with his weapon in front declaring fiercely your opponent is me turu if you want to fight then fight me an overwhelming surge of power spread both Augustine and turu had entered a stay of full combat Readiness the Divine Shield Augustine declared boldly The Unfinished battle from 10,000 years ago will conclude here today turu charged forward with a tumultuous momentum shouting align with my will the two collided commencing a life and death Showdown every strike they exchanged created violent Tremors causing the realm of Blazing Flames to shake ywo could clearly sense the immense power from their confrontation he thought to himself this force is truly terrifying but I must delay time quickly otherwise it will be disadvantageous for Augustine y Wu looked around wondering with the immense size of the realm of Blazing Flames where should I begin my search right the drones but they can't withstand the temperature here how could I forget such an important matter he took a deep breath and reassured himself now that I possess Divine level power with the rank of the Blazing Emperor reaching 999 this is entire L my territory therefore finding someone shouldn't be difficult Yu raised his hand casting his power to form a gigantic Eye in the Sky he commanded powerfully true eye full level locate Locker for me no matter what scheme she has employed I must find her the system immediately reported Target position locked ler and Marilyn the time manipulation skill has recovered to normal would the host like to execute the command right now he looked towards the position of the two others and replied no need I am in the realm of Blazing Flames like a fish in water I have no need to go back instead I want to think of a way to suppress her here so she cannot Escape Yu's gaze suddenly changed but first we need to deal with the giant here to avoid unexpected events returning to the battle the fiery giant king had been pierced through by the father of gods his health only remaining at 20% he did not expect Austine although old still hasn't diminished in strength compared to his Peak years ago turu knelt on the ground and said I have underestimated you I never expected to fight you with this frail body I must apologize for my disrespect but immediately after he suddenly erupted with flames I will use all my power to fight you to the death Augustine was astonished Eternal Flame I thought I had separated it from your body in our previous battle and hidden it in the Divine realm could it be turu replied that's right the Eternal Flame is a gift from Locker a condition for me to protect her as the father of gods you didn't expect this did you at this moment turu had recovered his health along with level 940 using the full form of the firey giant king to prepare for battle and said I originally intended to rest a little longer but if the timing is right he charged to attack Austine then let me open the Twilight of your Gods with one slash turum had severed the weapon in Augustine's hand leaving him with only 30% Health turum held his sword ready to stab Augustine and said you have no way out anymore Austine except your final fate suddenly the sword was blocked by an unseen Force turu could not help but be astonished by the current situation at the moment that seemed hopeless yiu suddenly appeared saving the God it was only midday now to say twilight had arrived was a bit early turuu exclaimed in surprise you the Beast with Firepower was quite shocked by Yu's prowess a mortal can withstand my attack the flames on you do not belong to our world who are you as this man Advanced he also swung his sword no wonder he was a god-level combatant with fire attributes his gaze Keen but who I am isn't important what's important is yiu filled with killing intent pointed his sword at turu I am very curious about whose fire is ultimately more powerful Yu severed the sharp claws of turu you're sharper than I thought this sparked his interest in ywu but that only makes it more enjoyable Augustine completely drained my excitement Only You Make Me Feel The Thrill I haven't experienced in a long time saying that he threw a fist toward the small figure in front of him a powerful punch crashed down sending rocks flying and creating strong gust of wind however ywu had completely transformed and was able to withstand this dangerous blow well done the force of this punch if I hadn't reached full level I would have probably been smashed to Pieces the advantage in terms of physique is quite apparent isn't it a sphere was gathering power high above but if we're talking about physique I am by no means inferior manifest flame demon another Beast appeared growling at its Master's command known as the flame demon complete form the system provided more detailed information about it the flame demon complete form is the final boss in the world of the Blazing Emperor after being defeated by the Blazing Emperor it was bound by armor that restricted its power the Blazing Emperor at full level could lift those bindings unleashing the full might of the flame demon the older man fighting alongside ywu couldn't believe his eyes a surge of ominous power that surprises the onlooker truly no less than turu with eternal fire Yu what kind of world do you come from turu quite enjoyed this opponent having strength nearly equal to mine makes it interesting doesn't it the flame demon sneered interesting haha wait until I bite off your neck then see if you still feel joyful y Wu turned back to speak with him father of gods continuing to Stand Here could put you in Greater danger quickly leave this place I will handle it here he reassured him no need to worry I can still hold on but there is one thing I want to clarify he asked your strength has surprised me even someone as knowledgeable as I am is astonished but you have grown so powerful why have you come to our world what is your ultimate goal he looked towards the two beasts locked in an unending battle if so then I will tell you everything a Tremor shook the ground causing large rocks to shatter into countless smaller pieces after hearing Yu's story he had to exclaim so that's it the destruction of the world is still unavoidable I never imagine even a ruler of the nine Realms like me would be unable to withstand the fate of my world he was astonished that the burden could only be placed on a valkyrie named Marilyn it was truly unacceptable however even if the outcome could not be changed there still existed another way to salvage the situation to lessen the consequences though the destruction of the world could not be avoided as long as one could leave before the world perished the people in this realm could still have hope for survival father of gods you will definitely find a way to make this happen right he said this is a good idea haha that's right I really am getting old and Sile falling into this negative emotion thank you Yu for waking me up he wasn't arrogant because of the old man's compliment no need to thank me this is what I should do saying that Yu picked up two Spears and asked by the way can I borrow these two Eternal Spears the father of gods hesitated a bit but they are already in your hands and the divine power has also lost more than half so they probably can't become your fighting strength now it's okay I will harmonize them with the Royal sword to repair don't forget that you previously granted me Divine Craftsman you w transformed into the Blazing Emperor then the next step is to end this battle both sides have already exhausted much of their power turu still remained arrogant haha this is so enjoyable being able to fight someone of your strength even if the battle shakes the heavens and earth I I won't feel tired the flame demon was different it showed no interest who is your kind I have no interest in fighting to shake the heavens and earth with you my only purpose is to prolong the time at this moment the flame demon shouted as if to announce turu you can go die now meanwhile Yu charged straight towards turu with the spear being stabbed tuu merely scoffed is that all this kind of attack which doesn't hurt or itch is ineffective against me but unexpectedly y w had another way isn't that so using the Blazing realm to separate your source of power can you still be so speechless he immediately endured the pain and cursed damn it my eternal fire I will kill you the flame demon had inserted its hand through his body TK form was torn in half and it said you no longer have this opportunity only the scream remains up ah turu was officially Anni ated the body of the Ferocious Beast from before was now divided into small Flames falling down below as for the old man after witnessing this fight he thought this is the true power of the strongest among worlds even if it were me in my youth at my Peak I surely could not reach this height the system notification boss feed has been defeated the enemy received 1 billion experience 500 million gold and the player received equipment these items include the Twilight sword a heavy holy sword crafted from the stone of creation that fell into the realm of Blazing Flames cultivated over countless years containing blazing Flames capable of cutting through space and dimensions with its ultra high temperature the second item is the original flame tomok although it is a war axe made from fragments of the stone of creation its power is also classified as a highlevel blade the body of the axe is hot lacking extremely high fire attributes making it uncontrollable the Third is the fiery Shield wall the flaming shield is inlaid with fragments of the stone of creation tempered at ultra high temperatures it has both ultra high defense and ultra high attack power regarding this the fourth equipment the burning demon Longbow does not require arrows and can shoot hot arrows like Mars with extremely high attack power and accuracy the fifth item the burning magic wand can summon powerful flame demons to fight with a maximum of five able to be summoned at once the sixth item is the crown of Destruction a symbol of fire once a Testament of the king finally the Eternal Flame also known as the primordial flame in chaos rises from a fire that burns dust creating hot air and forming the sky although intangible it is eternal Yi Wu is thrilled by these items no wonder it is a boss with 900 experience points and divine level equipment he held them until his hands felt weak from Joy however y descended for he had only just completed the first step in his plan it was not yet time to Rejoice he said father of gods I still wish to request another special Divine from you the deity was alarmed Your Divine is already strong enough do you still need my Divine deep in the earth in the flame domain the girl said my treasure do you hear the Earth shattering sounds of battle outside it must be the father of gods clashing with the fiery giant king our plan has taken step forward a soul standing nearby remarked and now the sounds of battle outside have disappeared it seems the outcome has been decided I just worry about turu that pawn will he really defeat Austine let's go let's verify she embraced this person I bring Eternal fire to turu he will absolutely not lose she added in the past the father of gods could only subdue turu by gathering all his strength in the Divine realm but now he is old and he can no longer win there is nothing to worry about as long as we absorb the outer God's power within Marilyn's body we will be able to start destroying this world then at that time I will be eternally Immortal with you transcending the ultimate latitude spreading Wings to do as we wish she laughed loudly ha a man approached from behind Lord ler do you want to leave me behind she abruptly ended the conversation and he clutched his bleeding arm that's great I finally found found you I'm tired of fighting I'm exhausted I don't want to be caught up in this anymore Glenn continued now I understand Lord ler you were right refusing your confession before was my foolishness now the only person I want to rely on is you are you still willing to accept me is this person like me an illusion was he created by Lord Locker I didn't expect my rejection to cause you such deep wounds I'm very sorry but rest assured I will definitely repay you double in the future ler looked at him and speculated the energy and Divine Essence on him are nothing unusual there is no doubt it is Glenn furthermore even if someone else were impersonating him it cannot possibly be Glenn the one I once confessed my feelings to without success however with Glenn's strength he would not be able to cross through the realm of Blazing Flames to come here without being injured this is clearly a fake lir held her head why is my heart in such turmoil the essence with the soul behind spoke there is no need to strouble regardless of whether he is real or fake killing him is enough do not let him interfere with our plans she remained silent upon hearing this the soul approached Glenn ler is hesitating what is it do you need me to take action personally suddenly she grasped the arm of the entity what are you doing why do you want to stop me from killing him within her she had her own consideration he cannot die yet I have my own arrangements with him Glenn ran over ler thank you for not giving up B me I already grown weary with my ineptitude in battling in the giant realm I realized my own insignificance a humble weak deity like me no matter how hard I try there are enemies I simply cannot defeat therefore I no longer wish to struggle I just want to be by your side you will definitely protect me right in an instant she thought even though every everywhere is filled with absurdity and illusion this feeling of the Embrace is so real she said it's all right if you don't want to make an effort just being beside me is enough I assure you no one can harm you he unexpectedly turned hostile is that so I should thank you then Lord ler she couldn't catch Glenn turns out this person is y wo in Disguise she was deceived Lord Lacher now I am sure I have forgotten everything but I once said in the past she did that to you the lies and schemes of her will return double suffering twice as much both physically and mentally are you satisfied caught off guard by Yu's sneak attack lerk strength was weakened enough that he couldn't endure she shouted absolutely impossible how could the disguise of an ordinary person fool my eyes who are you really how do you have the shape-shifting ability that not even I recognize regarding my affair with Glenn how did you know the true self held her back don't let your guard down you might receive a serious blow it proves he is definitely not an ordinary person we should Retreat first she was gradually recovering from his Ambush telling herself I can't let him continue to impersonate Glenn to deceive me and I absolutely will not forgive him y Wu said the god plan has been trapped by my scheme doesn't it feel unpleasant curious are we I know about you and Glenn but I won't say a word laer split his clone and aimed his space at ywu you Dam mortal dare to underestimate a god like me I will torment you in the most painful way making you suffer for over a thousand years he said is that so YW swung the large sword causing the Illusions to vanish if this had been before I would have believed you the sword in his hand lit up but now the power from the mirror began to Surge and she no longer had this chance he thrust straight into her back why can you see through my True Form Yu's face was filled with murderous intent you are about to die no need to know too much Glenn's True Form caught her I told you don't act rashly this small matter is insignificant compared to our grand scheme but she remains obstinate she still refuses to let go lock your hist let me go I must slay him Yu could not grasp the objective running again huh he said the the energy entity resembling Glenn is quite cautious undoubtedly a tough opponent in the realm of Blazing flames in another underground space loir screamed why why must you stop me I was toyed with and overwhelmed by a mere mortal revenge is something I must achieve the true form of Glenn drawing power from Marilyn said don't let hatred diminish your intellect ler the more Furious you are the easier it is to fall into his schemes our strength is clearly at a distance facing him directly before was not a good opportunity lir was still seething with anger I know he is powerful but I cannot bear the humiliation of his deceit and I cannot endure running away the true form after being merged said who said anything about running away I merely sense that the absorption of the true form is about to be completed to take over the body now the outer God power within Marilyn is entirely mine no one in this world can defeat me anymore vure said luckily our plan has succeeded this unprecedented pressure has far surpassed Augustine and his Peak I never expected Marilyn's energy to carry such terrifying strength she added that Yu guy is getting close to Marilyn like that he must have set his sights on her power right now that the power has been completely drained becoming a useless person his purpose has also vanished I can't wait to see his defeated look to relieve the hatred in my heart Yu overheard their conversation thank you thank you very much you really helped me with a big issue I initially had no idea how to deal with the unstable power within Marilyn's body she was astonished what Yu with a combative expression moved closer but now that you've drained it all away I no longer have to worry are you all prepared to receive my returned gift ler face was filled with panic at this scene she wondered how is this possible this man has chased us down and he doesn't care at all about the outer God power within Marilyn the energy emanating from him exudes an overwhelming strength it doesn't feel like a joke what should I do I'm no match for him should I run away again the ultra entity behind Locker shabed loudly at her ler what are you worry about I am now the strongest existence in this world dealing with him is as easy as flipping my hand but the grudge between you is something you must resolve on your own with this great outer God don't let me down now Upon finishing his words he placed his large hand on later's head channeling a surge of tremendous energy into her later's body was enveloped in a blinding light she transformed into a different form her body and hands turning green sharp claws emerging and her body covered in spikes several Tails appeared below and a dragon's head with glowing red eyes bearing sharp teeth let out a fierce Roar ler laughed hardly showing her sharp fangs and and said my wounds have healed and I feel like I've been filled with immense power truly a joy like never before a system stats board appeared boss lock here level 900 she challenged come on Mortal you're so close to me let's play together Locker lashed out her tail at yiu sing him flying she laughed loudly asking him with this power how do you want to play I can play until the end but can you afford the price of losing flesh Soul haha yiu was struck flying far and crashing into a rock due to the violent impact ler rushed over and asked why aren't you fighting back weren't you very strong earlier are you now afraid of my power bayen fan doy V ranal Den tan Kong Wu lamb da hat tooi that's it that's it this is the feeling of looking down on all living beings right it's simply wonderful I want to endlessly lers shouted loudly what's wrong hurry and resist resist at least once just like this I can end you as easily as crushing an ant I truly find it very boring after saying this she used her power to strike down from the sky at ywu causing the ground and rocks to shatter the superlife form floated in the air arms crossed surrounded by the swirling dust and debris saying to Counterattack is impossible even if that more moral had a way to defeat locker before she has changed now and there is no reason for her to lose anymore surely that mortal has even lost their form now lokier and the superlive form were surprised when a light appeared at the swirling fog he shouted wait a minute that light was ye Wu transforming wearing a green cloak and armor he held a golden sword in his hand the system data panel appeared y woo level 999 Health decreased to 80% he looked up at the sky and said the reason I do not retaliate is that I am very curious about how powerful the combined strength of a God and an a God can become but from the results it seems that it is only this much ler cued her head angrily shouting no it can't be clearly I used all my strength yet it only caused a small amount of damage to you I don't believe it absolutely do not believe it lerk body curled up forming a large flower bud in the air surrounded by a shimmering Golden Circle she shouted I cannot spare you I will definitely not spare you even if it cost more than I can afford she continued I must kill you as soon as she finished speaking the flower butt opened simultaneously unleashing a tremendous power aimed at Yu he calmly watched the attack charging towards him and said I told you you will not have this chance again the violet light power when it barreled towards Yi Wu was met with his defense causing it to explode aside the life formed from the microcosm observed the battle from above thinking the power of this Mortal has exceeded my expectations ler cannot defeat him it appears my investment has failed a golden Power struck the demons causing their bodies to disintegrate the demons panicked in Surprise and screamed what's happening the realm of Blazing Flames is about to collapse run quickly y Wu raised the sword looked into it and touched the surface of the sword lightning appeared around the sword he said in this turn-based game it's my turn to Counterattack now Yu charged forward striking at ler ler endured numerous painful slashes screaming H I'm not willing to accept this why are you so strong I won't accept this yiu rested the sword on his shoulder standing directly in front of her ler you really look both ugly and disheveled you have abandoned your Noble God identity Falling Into Darkness losing everything L here collapsed to the ground a status panel appearing boss Locker level 900 Health only 20% remaining fighting strength completely depleted at 0% she furiously shouted damn it the noble God identity this kind of restrictive identity I have long grown tired of I want to play hard to cheap wholeheartedly unable to contain her anger ler slammed her hand on the ground continuing even Thor and the frost giant king have been tricked by me how can I not trick you even if my combat power is not as good as yours Vu returned to her original form wielding a scepter and using a ler clone to bind Marilyn who lay on the ground she said I can still use cunning to strike straight at your weakness making you regret to the point of wishing you were dead y Wu glared at loir in anger and asked loudly do you think I only care about fighting you and have no means to protect Marilyn your schemes are too despicable an attacking Force struck severing later's hand that held the staff catching her by surprise The superlife Entity floating in the air created a technique directing it at Locker saying do not touch that woman laier at this point any scheme is meaningless laier enraged transformed and shouted at him asking are you attacking me why I clearly sacrificed everything for you aside from you I have nothing why are you still betraying me he looked at her and replied it's because you have disappointed me too much with the power I bestowed not even a moral can win it seems only Marilyn who possesses external power can be the woman who walks with me to the end loir screamed in Anger no you can't treat me like this you must be joking right I have done so much for you how can you abandon me the super life entity in front of locker responded emotions let them go such things are of no value to me I only care if the one allied with me has the ability to achieve the goals I desire he continued your current appearance clearly indicates that you cannot control the power of the outer God within you now that you are broken do not drag me down but for the sake of your previous contributions if you dare to continue obstructing me then you must die after finishing he made his move causing ler to be crushed under a powerful magic circle the status board appeared boss Locker level 900 2% Health locky screamed in pain I have spent my whole life using every trick uttering countless lies and in the end the only true feeling I offered resulted in this ending she laughed loudly haha ridiculous ridiculous all this time I mocked others for being foolish only to find out the real clown is myself she laughed hardly before disappearing ing the ultra beinging looked at ywu and said the next battle is between you and me you were the only obstacle I face in this world as long as I kill you my goal will be achieved Yu looked at him and asked was ler disappearance at this moment part of your plan he charged at Yu to attack and replied no I have absolute power I never play with tricks she was just a useless Pawn easily discarded he looked at him and thought this matter is absolutely not as simple as it seems even if he has no wicked schemes based on ler style I know he won't easily Let It Go like that at the Tree of Life Locker appeared in her original form before her stood a tall ancient tree with a wide canopy of bright yellow leaves ler laughed loudly haha if my destiny is determined to be a farce then I will destroy this world lir angrily approached touching the roots of the tree her eyes turning purple dark energies swirling around her she shouted loudly declaring it so that no one could laugh hovering in the raging storm that tore apart everything the god looked down arrogantly at his opponent mortal to this world both of us are Outsiders I know you carry some special power within you but that power cannot serve as a foundation to oppose me because our very existence is separated by too many layers if we liken worlds to boxes you are merely a mouse that is scurried from one box into another forever unable to jump out of the constraints of this box I am the existence that has escaped the confines of the world standing outside to observe countless worlds he declared with great Authority as if he were the center of the universe you and I are not on the same level at all as soon as he finished speaking the god began to channel energy and Unleashed his lava eruption skill under the ground streams of vibrant red material surged upwards twisting into a tornado aimed directly at Yu Yu drove his sword into the ground successfully blocking the attack he said I know youd like to show off otherwise you wouldn't go so far as to say such foolish things but knowing I have the fire attribute you still used lava to wash your feet for me your combat experience is still somewhat lacking he felt exasperated by the enemy's foolish handling of the situation on the other side the God was Furious because he had been countered right after showing his strength what you dare to brag even when death is near he tensed his body gathered energy and formed a dark abyss it seems that you haven't understood what I said nor the true power of superbeings in words you can understand I am capable not only of killing you in this world but I can also enter your world destroying everything in that world and everything you hold dear as he shouted he unleashed the dark abyss he W refus to be outdone he raised his sword and activated the Blazing Windstorm skill with swirls of hot air spiraling creating a Vortex emitting heat of up to 1,000° oh really so this super being is indeed very strong but I will not give you that opportunity two opposing sources of energy collided creating a thunderous sound the shock wave generated sweeping away everything within a radius of hundreds of kilometers the god seeing that the attack had been neutralized became surprised you can actually fight on par with me it seems I've underestimated you taking advantage of the opponent's distraction Yi Wu charged forward grinting his teeth this is nothing compared to what you think anyone who threatens what I care about usually pays a heavy price you are no exception as he spoke he swung his sword at the God but the latter easily blocked it not forgetting to taunt is that so with your current strength you might be able to achieve that but when your opponent is me all your experience is useless the god shouted loudly as a mesmerizing formation appeared behind him Yi Wu immediately became alert the cosmic like light beside him was incredibly Eerie seemingly capable of distorting time and space necessitating a distance increase the god continued to boast about himself although you are quite strong just looking at your appearance you'd have only lived for a little over 10 years you fundamentally cannot comprehend the truths of this universe once Yu regained his balance he wondered the truths of the universe what are they he said destruction without hesitation he provided the answer destruction is the ultimate destination of the universe and all things I am merely helping you choose the correct Method Of Destruction this is something only someone who can transcend Dimensions like me can do God continued to Ramble On we were born together with time and dimensions initially I was just an observer recording without any consciousness of my own but after witnessing the casualties across various Dimensions I gradually developed my own Consciousness reflecting on the great tragedies of the past I commented that after an endless span of observation I arrived at a conclusion different dimensions and civilizations though continuously giving birth to new forms will ultimately lead to destruction and all of them are methods of Destruction that are incredibly foolish I possess an intellect that transcends dimensions and what I detest most is that foolishness rather than allowing ignorance to reain I would prefer to use my preferred method to bring about destruction however despite my intellect and power surpassing Dimensions I can only observe these dimensions and cannot interfere with them regret manifested in the heart of the God he continued it wasn't until I discovered that there exists a group of beings in the universe that stands in opposition to my power and authority outer Gods though they do not possess power beyond their realm have the ability to influence that realm therefore if I were to extract the outer God's power from within Marilyn without killing her then I would directly summon its true form suddenly a ray of purple light shot down from above him striking directly upon his figure a monster formed from energy appeared with four orbs arranged in a diamond shape each orb containing a singular eye it screamed out who is summoning me the god looked up and replied it is I grant me all your power God of destruction after image he commanded the bean the fore monster stared intently at him and responded you resemble me yet are different but it matters not those who summon me are all the same now let us begin upon hearing this the god felt delated wonderful wonderful this is the power I desire to intervene in the realm from start to finish everything has been part of my plan haha I have observed for countless years witnessed numerous destructions and now at last the time has come for me to take control of everything he felt the power continuously flooding into his body filling each muscle and fiber he laughed maniacally but the monster rebutted it is you who leads every destruction no no no this is not something you should be doing the only thing you must do now is to offer this body to me to become the stepping stone on my path to reincarnation the purple energy quickly enveloped the God's body only the sounds of Screams could be heard from within wait what is happening the frenzied depraved power is corroding my Essence stop stop it this is not the outcome I wanted the sound gradually faded but behind it was a harsh reality in a moment he the God had completely transformed by the God of destruction the remnants created an extraordinarily powerful being destroy obliterate the more this world is destroyed the faster I can be reborn it let out a Savage laugh haha to celebrate the successful reincarnation the monster Stomp P down causing the ground to tremble starting from this world this forced Yu to rise into the air to evade the shock waves a thought flashed in his mind the shadow of the God of destruction isn't this the God of destruction split by the Shadow King if this is true then it's not good I never expected the God of destruction to also be seeking a chance for reincarnation he immediately made a decision I must stop it here I cannot let it use the destruction of this world as a pretext for rebirth suddenly the high energy monster blew yiu away sending him flying you smell like someone I hate it used its Keen sense of smell to recognize the connection between him and the Shadow King the power of the attack was so great that yiu was slamed deep into the cliff the surrounding terrain continuously cracking damn it this overwhelming power is definitely the God of destruction even in this shadowy form it can easily knock me away in my Peak State this time it's a bit hard Yu suddenly found himself in a desperate situation as his opponent had reached a new level of annihilation the God of destruction did not allow its opponent to catch a breath it shouted the smell on your body is similar to an enemy of mine but I have already killed him therefore whether by coincidence or other reasons it is only fitting to annihilate you in this world the monster immediately Unleashed its skill World destroying Fallen star with tens of thousands of MERS continuously Crashing Down aiming to wipe out the battlefield yiu was incredibly surprised by the opponent's detection ability so you can detect the Shadow King on me that's truly terrifying seeing his teammate lying unconscious he began to ponder although I used a shield to protect Marilyn can I cope with its attack now there's only one way left which is to absorb the burning power of the realm of Blazing Flames then give it my all saying is doing ywu summon the terminal dark flame form his armor now thoroughly upgraded energy level skyrocketing he tightened his grip on the space god in his hand determined that this was the final battle a great battle unfolding y Wu held the long space Unleashed his move thinking in his mind facing a Str men like this it must be a swift fight it cannot be prolonged too long I need to directly use a powerful move to resolve the issue he launched the flame demon long a green dragon soaring towards the strowman the strowman L said oh facing my attack and you still have the strength to dodge you are quite powerful reminding me of previous enemies but all of you only have one outcome then he jumped up slashing at the dragon splitting it in half he said that is what being destroyed by me looks like as soon as he landed he was immediately bombarded by six energy orbs flying towards him he leaped up dodging the attack still pursuing her he analyzed the situation in his mind realizing this level of physical strength is still not enough I must use caution against that guy suddenly the six orbs released chains binding him Yi Wu's voice echoed where do you think you're going although he was chained Yi Wu calmly replied oh this scorching power reminds me of the warmth when the universe was newly born he then continued what do you intend to do with all the immense energy just condensed this method of fighting has no effect on me yiu shouted whether it has an effect or not we won't know until we try he summoned a fireball sneering the God of destruction born in the universe huh then let's use all the Blazing flame power to converge into a star to determine the Victor at this moment the other person Bound by Iron chains felt uneasy as he saw the fireball rushing towards him this Force isn't just for show can it break free from the restraints the fireball collided with him creating a cataclysmic explosion ywu now exhausted knelt on the ground as the system displayed a warning warning the host has momentarily exhausted all the power of the Blazing Emperor resulting in extreme fatigue and backlash unable to use any abilities please withdraw from the battlefield quickly at this moment the life of the super God of destruction was down to 15% Health the other person laughed loudly haha you startled me I thought I was about to die at your hands he tore off the steel chains charged forward and said you should feel grateful that my underdeveloped body has given you so many opportunities now you can rest easy and die at that moment Yu was extremely exhausted unable to move when he saw the God of destruction charging at him he worried not good my body can't move suddenly a beam of light Shone down on him and a voice echoed who gave you the guts to lay a hand on my brother a group group of people with white Wings landed on the ground praising y woo V woo well done thanks to you absorbing all the heat from the realm of Blazing Flames we could come here to support you and then pursue those Gods to clean up the battlefield Gods heed the call help our hero deliver a fatal blow to the enemies from outside the followers replied in unison okay and immediately rushed to attack the God of destruction surrounded and being beaten the God of destruction angrily cursed you little ants even more of you still aren't enough to take me down sulto hearing this became Furious and said aside from your endless nonsense my big hammer has been hungry for a while now just watch I might just punch you to death in the end the God of destruction was left with only 5% Health damn it this group of pests was supposed to be an easy kill but I've been completely overwhelmed by their numbers I have to figure out how to hold on for now you he wo leaped into the air summoning lightning to strike down and shouted leave our world the evil forces from outside have come here this is not a place for you the God of destruction enraged yelled back how dare you I W Tarn to have this chance to be reborn suddenly he transformed into a cube and flew into a cosmic hole as he soared away he joyfully thought what is happening I was in the middle of a fight and now I've been saved thank goodness for you all i' have finally escape the control of that outer God's power as long as I get away from this Dimension those lowly beings like you will not be able to chase me anymore haha at that moment sto's Hammer Came Crashing Down on the Queue so your true form is that thing from the giant realm suto said ler used that Cube to torment me and now I can finally take my revenge running away won't be so easy sulto irritably exclaimed damn it some fragments are escaping y Wu witnessing this scene was puzzled and wondered wait fragments escaping why does it feel like the fragments that infiltrated the stronghold before this feeling seemed to tie a series of events together leaving him confused in the meantime Marilyn lying motionless on the ground was suddenly invaded by an external Force you w worried not good that terrifying external power has invaded Marilyn's body the gods saw this and said dear father of gods we all know the terrifying power of that Force we must handle her before Marilyn loses control to avoid dire consequences for the safety of the nine Realms we can only sacrifice Marilyn if she has chosen to be a valkyrie she must have already awakened to the notion of sacrifice ye who heard this and spoke up to intervene no you cannot do this even if you are Gods you do not have the right to decide Marilyn's life or death but if you forced your hand even Even in our weakened State we will fight back against you one God spoke up why woo he asked him earlier you said Marilyn is the key to determining the world's fate because of the external power she possesses which is indeed extremely dangerous I cannot ignore this matter concerning the safety of the nine Realms hearing this Yu replied yes in different timelines it is this force that caused the world to be destroyed my emergence is to prevent such a result you must trust me the previously silent God did not say anything else but the other gods continued it's not that we do not trust you but we cannot afford to ignore a lubing threat like this if we do not eliminate it none of us can feel at ease another God added that's right it's not that we do not trust you but we cannot take the gamble the chances of preserving both Marilyn and the nine Realms are too slim at this moment sulto supported Yu brother no matter what they say I believe in you whatever you do I will support you Glenn added me too a deity below said suto Glenn how can you act on your emotions the survival of the nine Realms is not the time for personal feelings Marilyn had now woken up she said you all don't argue over me anymore I have finally remembered what kind of person I will become Yu was surprised to hear Marilyn's voice Marilyn Marilyn continued originally I had all the memories from the moment I opened my eyes until now only a few memories were forced to be hidden by myself now I remember I am not from this world I came to this world along with a shooting star from the moment I opened my eyes there was always a voice in my head a voice that kept repeating destroying and ruining it was a young Village Chief who discovered me while hunting and brought me back to the Village she recounted even though I was just a child at that time because of my impulsiveness and inability to control my power I brought a lot of trouble to the Village but the village Chief and his wife always treated me with utmost kindness like their own daughter because of this I gradually became touched and regarded them as my parents the fear's aura on me also diminished significantly she continued to recount her voice full of Anguish not until I was 5 years old when I went up the mountain with my mother to gather firewood did I get ambushed by the monster in the midst of panic I once again used my power but I couldn't control it when I exterminated the monster I inadvertently killed my mother as well the pain and regret led me to seal that power along with the memories of the incident it wasn't until the outer God Power Within Me was awakened that I remembered everything she bowed her head her voice choking I am the one sent to destroy this world I am the villain Marilyn's eyes clouded with sadness you who stood beside her silently listening feeling the pain in every word she spoke Marilyn continued I don't deserve to be saved if you want you can end my life Yu said nothing only quietly communicated with the system in his mind system why must Marilyn's true identity be hidden the system replied it's not so much a concealment as it is the powerful disturbance caused by the outer God power within her creating an obscure fate unknown to anyone however the arrival of a new host has altered the threads of this fate this could provide an opportunity to achieve the mission with a perfect score of 100% along with a special reward you w do not care about the rewards that the system spoke of to him the reward meant nothing compared to saving Marilyn he looked at her seriously placed his hand on her shoulder and spoke with heartfelt sincerity Marilyn to me you were the most deserving person to be saved in this world the only reason I came to this world is because of you you saved me when I was in trouble if this time I cannot save you then everything becomes meaningless hearing those words words Marilyn felt her face flush unable to look directly at yiu she shyly opened her mouth lwo obviously you have always been the one to encourage and save me but when did I save you Yu looked straight into her eyes and said in my past your future this story is quite long in short you just need to trust me at that moment sulam nudged G wool lightly on the shoulder grinning slightly I uh my brother is there anything else you're hiding from me we're not strangers after all why don't you tell me what exactly your relationship with Marilyn is before y wo could respond an old man clad in golden armor with two horns protruding from his chest cleared his throat a few times and spoke sulto do not inquire into matters that do not concern you now in the name of Augustine father of gods I declare the campaign to be officially over we have won as soon as the old man in the golden armor finished declaring Victory the ground set ly shook violently with large cracks spreading everywhere everyone was startled not understanding what was happening an earthquake but the enemy has been defeated why is this still happening they looked around anxiously at the same time in the human town the ground was pierced by countless enormous Roots the Earth cracked and houses collapsed into ruin the sound of panic echoed everywhere what is happening these roots why are they growing like crazy our town our houses everything is destroyed an old man in despair knelt on the ground shouting run we must find a place that isn't being attacked by The Roots a gray-haired girl beside him anxiously helped the old man up looking at the enormous Roots piercing through the ground filled with fear could it be that ye Mo and Marilyn have encountered some trouble no matter what you all must survive at the same time in the city of gold a group of enormous Roots also suddenly emerged from the ground piercing through the entire city the sound of panic filled the air this is not good the city of gold is about to collapse but the father of gods and the other deities are not here what are we going to do the soldier stood Frozen his eyes fixated on the gigantic roots that continuously pierced through the structures of the Fortress they were completely powerless unsure of what to do what on Earth are these roots the City of Gold has always been solidly protected by Divine forces and sacred artifacts how can it be destroyed now they wondered in confusion meanwhile Yu's group was enveloped by the realm of Blazing Flames protected by a Golden Barrier through the barrier they could see the enormous Roots rising from the ground with white Flames blazing from them ye W realize quietly these are the roots of the tree of life but now they are tainted is this the truth the tree of life is the foundation of the nine Realms everything relies on it for stability if it really is Tainted then the entire nine Realms will collapse but the one with the power of the outer God has been destroyed where did this tainted power of the Tree of Life come from Marilyn has also lost control so who could have caused this just as everyone was still in doubt a distorted face suddenly appeared Among The Roots it was laier from her cheeks and Chin Roots sprouted grotesquely creating a chilling and bizarre image laer laughed her laughter echoing in the air haha everything has turned turned out this way because you all forced me if I cannot live then you shall not have peace either you all must die I will drag the entire nine Realms down with me sulto thrust the hammer forward channeling thunderous power into it then shouted loudly ler so it was you who did this daring to use the power of the outer God to corrupt the tree of life I will take your life the old man clad in golden armor wielding the golden Trident raised it high golden lightning surged from the Trident aiming at Locker he commanded loudly sulto this is not the time to bicker with her all God heed my command join forces to kill ler and prevent the destruction of the nine Realms all the gods promptly lunged forward their weapons ready to strike at the face emerging amidst the tree roots of ler obey orders everyone put forth all your strength to kill the traitor of the Gods ler stood among the tree roots laughing maniacally a St dream of light purple liquid trickling from the corners of her eyes resembling water her gaze was filled with contempt as she spoke kill me even the space of Eternity and Thor's hammer cannot harm me what can you do gods were humans all Must Die she continued to laugh hysterically I have abandoned the form of the god merging into one with the Tree of Life precisely to annihilate you all haha indeed as luckier said the space of Eternity and Thor's hammer simultaneously charged forward but could not break through the tough layer of roots encasing ler solto anxiously watched the Frantic scene before him wondering what on Earth has happened has Locker gone insane to this extent in their prophecy has the Twilight of the Gods truly arrived Marilyn slowly stepped forward from behind calmly addressing everyone let me go the strength of the outer God comes from my body it all originates from me even if it cost me my life I must suppress the corruption and Madness of the tree of life sulto was startled and called out to Marilyn Marilyn the gods below were also worried and tried to dissuade Marilyn from advancing desperately urging her to step back father of gods and Thor are both taking action and along with the strength of everyone they have been unable to do anything to it what can a valkyrie like you possibly achieve sulto suddenly shouted to silence the agitated crowd shut up this is not the time for internal conflicts sulto suddenly remembered and turned to Y wo asking right brother don't you have the ability to control time why not simply go back to the moment before Locker executed the evil plot and stop her then ye woo closed his eyes appearing somewhat distressed as he spoke I'm sorry I had intentionally concealed some information before the destruction of this world has already been predetermined no matter what we do it cannot be changed what we have now is the best outcome next Marilyn and I will do our utmost to control the Tree of Life buying time for you I believe the father of gods will surely find a way to lead the people of the nine Realms to escape ywu then turned his gaze to the crowd around him the crowd below hearing ye we speak was in disbelief taking the people from the nine Realms and fleeing this is a pike dream absolutely impossible to achieve the old man in golden armor fell silent as if deep been thought after a while he finally spoke up to propose letun go to platin if we take the ship to platin and expand it to its maximum size it should be able to accommodate everyone leading everyone away suto joyfully agreed this method of yours works I can also use the God's weapon Thor's hammer and the space of Eternity from the nine Realms to open the teleportation gate bringing everyone onto the ship the gods below reassured by sulto nodded in agreement with the plan great even the father of gods and Thor have said so so there should be no problem solto once again worried for ye W in Marilyn however whether this plan can succeed depends on how long your brother and Marilyn can hold out y Wu stood straight beside Marilyn hands tucked into his pockets asserting confidently trust us you all just need to hurry and carry out the plan sulto felt touched and smiled shaking Yu's hand for a final farewell brother the debt of gratitude you owe to our world I do not wish to wait until the next life to repay you must hold on and after everyone boards the ship I will use Thor's hammer to come pick you up just like before Glenn also walked over proudly smiling at Marilyn Marilyn although you carry the mission that no one could have imagined I do not regret recruiting you into the ranks of The Valkyrie your performance truly lives up to the title of Valkyrie even if the destruction of the world is unavoidable I still hope this is not our final farewell I will we will wait for you at platin Marilyn was slightly taken aback looking at Glenn unsure of what to say captain Glenn press for time quickly LED everyone to the plat ship the golden radiant light enveloping them the voice of the old man in golden armor echoed as they departed vwoo you are the hero of this world the legend of a hero should not come to an end too soon we have never abandoned a hero we will wait for you ye W would Marilyn silently watched everyone leave once all had gone ye wo extended his hand to Marilyn let's go it's time to welcome the final moment Marilyn Marilyn grasped Yu's hand firmly as if they had held hands countless times in the past smiling brightly and saying yep as long as I'm with you I fear nothing even if ahead lies only destruction and despair in front on the roots of the life tree that were polluted countless faces were growing all the faces of Locker looking down at the two people below sneering and saying vwoo do you really think you can stop me you have just gone through a great battle and are not only weakened but the outer God power in Marilyn's body is also out of her control if you forcefully use the outer God's power to stop me she might go crazy and kill people with me haha a useless weakling and a mad woman out of control what can you two possibly do don't struggle anymore no one can escape in the nine Realms letting you die to together is already the greatest pity for me laier said then controlled countless thick Roots like tentacles to rush towards the two people below the ground wanting to grab them however the roots had not even touched them when a purple light shattered them loer was taken back what loer looked in disbelief at the countless purple likes enveloping Marilyn you dare to use this outer God power don't you fear that losing control of the power will implicate you woo Marilyn's voice was strangely calm she said this has nothing to do with Divine strength the reason I fell into madness and lost control was because I always rejected this current of Power Within Me creating a conflict between the urge to kill and destroy and the power itself but now I have completely accepted this current of power I just need to follow my inner self using this power to continuously kill and destroy and the target I want to kill and destroy is you Marilyn said this as she swung her Sword Down countless the sword strikes aimed directly at the roots of latches Leed shouted angrily damn it no matter how strong you are you cannot kill my roots I have been running around the nine Realms you cannot prolong your time do not waste your efforts the destruction of the world is inevitable just wait to die and enjoy the destruction of your fate Marilyn ignored lerk words wielding her sword to chop through the roots of the tree before charging directly to the base of later's tree and thrusting her sword down hard she coldly stated who needs to go through the trouble of chopping your roots across the nine Realms I just need to make sure you cannot grow as the tip of Marilyn's sword plunged down energy rapidly gathered at the point of the blade ler looked on in Terror at Marilyn who was absorbing the power and life force of the Tree of Life Through The Sword in her hand she dares to sien my strength at this moment no one noticed y wo slowly approaching from below the frenzy growth of the tree of life has diminished it seems my previous plan has had an effect the system's task was merely to keep Marilyn in a rational State for the final there was no stipulation against using external divine power next I can only hope that the dissolution action of the father of God can be completed quickly as the roots of the tree began to wither due to the loss of power Leches anxiously turned to attack Marilyn psyche with his words in an attempt to stop her stop it Marilyn you cannot withstand the immense suffering brought by the tree of light's power when it eyes loer said why why put in so much for those who look down on you what do the Valkyries truly symbolize in Victory merely tools of the Gods there's no need to go this far as the roofs began to lose their strength ler face on the tree also grew old and Haggard ler continued to assault Marilyn psych don't be so stubborn no man is worth it ler continued even y wo the one you love most is just using you once he is done with you he will have no hesitation in tossing you aside all the suffering you have endured will be in vain Marilyn hearing ler mentioned y wo finally reacted fiercely retorting so what as long as it's y woo I will willingly be used and manipulated by him becoming his tool a person who will never meet someone worthy of my devotion truly pitiful ler therefore the one who should give up is you your Temptation towards me is futle what I carry is more important than suffering and destruction later's face was almost drained his eyes wide as he screamed this [ __ ] must die it's all destruction why why stop me from seeking Revenge I cannot accept it I cannot accept it but no matter how unwilling ler was in the end he also withered away like a root drained of its strength leaving only a withered desolate Branch at the scene at the same time at the boat God de platy many people were being led onto the ship hurry this is the last group everyone get on the ship quickly this world is about to be destroyed the gray-haired girl hearing the situation explained by the Divine technique cried out in anguish what are you saying is it really ye woo and Maryland who are preventing everything buying us time to escape receiving a confirmed answer the gray-haired girl became so desperate that she sat down on the ground covering her face and weeping no they cannot be this life-threatening burden Hulu ye woo Marilyn you absolutely cannot have an accident you must survive and come back solto stood on the high platform and seeing that everyone was on board signaled old man everyone is on the boat let's set sail I will use joler to fetch Yi Wu and the others the old man in golden armor immediately waved his hand to Signal de platy set sail y Wu and Maryland stood below surrounded by the thunderclaps of of the sky looking up at the distant ship and murmuring has it finally set sail successfully Solo's voice echoed from the ship vwu just like last time grasp the handle of joler and you will be able to transfer in time remember you must hold onto the Hammer's handle in order to succeed yiu looked up in surprise at the Divine ship suto is transmitting through J isn't he Yu looked at the hammer floating before him not gripping the handle to turn back as sulto in Ed but gently touched the face of the hammer smiling and replying I will not go with you anymore I have to stay by Maryland's side I hope you find the path of survival in the other world solto I am very glad to be brothers with you this memory I will never forget the system notification echoed in yiwu's mind the mission completion rate has reached 100% the dimensional Escape door is about to open the teleportation door countdown begins 10 9 Yu slowly stepped toward where Marilyn was standing I'm sorry Marilyn Yu said then hugged Marilyn tightly Whispering you've suffered so much but this is all I can do Marilyn touched wrapped her arms around y wo vwoo you done very well this is already the best result we could achieve the greatest regret for me is that I can't be with you forever Marilyn said that nestled into Yu's Embrace yiu smiled as as he looked at Marilyn's blushing cheeks gently saying no we can be together forever now this is also the biggest purpose I came to your world for Marilyn softly replied I believe everything you say as the countdown finished a dazzling light appeared enveloping the two of them when the countdown reached zero the teleportation door opened successfully transporting them to the real world when Yi Wu landed once more countless insects appeared around him rushing towards him to tear him apart Yu hurriedly commanded system switched to the Fallen Valkyrie account Marilyn immediately appeared using her Shield to block the swarm of insects attacking Yu a happy smile on her face I knew you wouldn't deceive me we can truly be together forever now yiu smiled as Marilyn firmly swung her sword towards a monster causing it to scream in pain ah she shouted ye wo gave me a new life and with me here who would dare to touch him after that she raised her hand smiling brightly and said ye woo we truly will be together forever yigu replied I told you I wouldn't deceive you the two held each other's hands tightly beaming with joy Marilyn happily responded even if it's in this form just being able to protect him is already incredibly fulfilling suddenly the system announced Realm of the Gods aranga begins to distribute the mission rewards for the dungeon mission completion progress is 100% the berserk Massacre debuff has been lifted the Valkyries account has been cleared and they can use their normal abilities activating the hidden lineage reward marilin chuj Shu nuk sing H the Valkyries can fight alone the Valkyries fighting alone rewards will be recalculated summoning 100% of the valkyrie's power lasting 30 seconds cool down time 7 Days reminder summoning 100% strength has a huge effect it will accumulate value far beyond madness please consider using it Yi Wu clenched his fists joyfully exclaimed being able to summon the full state of the Valkyries for 30 seconds this is an existence that can destroy Heaven and Earth he thought to himself but if there are side effects it should only be used in Desperate situations then a crown of Destruction ring ignited in the sky Yu is secretly delighted this dungeon Harvest is quite rich not only have I obtained various powerful tools and weapons but I also got another ingredient for the resurrection potion from before this is too good the cube thought to itself I remember now I finally remember because of traversing through countless spaces I forgot my purpose for coming here I came here solely for revenge against that guy he continued but I didn't expect that he would bring Marilyn back to this world what can I do now I have to quickly run away Marilyn and Yu had started to pay attention to him immediately Marilyn brandished her sword and charged towards the cube causing it to panic it stammered pleading wait wait let me speak our conflict was in the previous Dimension letun leave it there we are in a new world now please spare me Marilyn swung her sword fiercely striking the cube and shattering it into pieces the fragments flew around and it screamed in Anger ah why why must you pursue and kill me damn it the insects of the lower space do you really think you can kill me I am an immortal entity transcending space even if I am shattered into dust I will not stop growing stronger Marilyn said nothing and used Fierce Flames to incinerate the cube it cried out wait this flaming metor is the power of the outer God how can you inherit the power of the outer God I am an eternal indestructible entity how can I be ah not finishing his sins the cube exploded and dust spread everywhere the system immediately announced successfully eliminated the frights of the cube received 50 million experience points 10 million gold coins and obtained the Divine item miniature hyperdimensional Cube the miniature hyperdimensional Cube can only be powered up by collecting unique fragments once the power up is successful it can teleport to various levels of different spaces unique fragments can be sensed in the dungeons during battles you U chuckled then thought to himself this Divine item is exactly what I need right now compared to passively entering the dungeon without preparation actively entering a space will be much easier but what exactly is this unique fragment is it the world outside or the dungeon space if it's the space of the outside world then it's Troublesome when he looked up he saw Marilyn gradually disappearing before leaving she didn't forget to wave goodbye she reminded y Wu time's up I have to go now remember I will always be by your side meeting you is the greatest Fortune of my life yiu replied cheerfully me too Marilyn after she disappeared yiu sighed and thought the story about Marilyn has finally ended beautifully I finally didn't turn into a female jewelry boss I viz regretfully replied oh Such a Pity I was hoping to see the owner dressed as a woman but in the end nothing happened y Wu immediately smacked I Vis on the head and then suddenly glanced back wondering hemp why is it coming here ail hurriedly ran over and Yu called Uncle then he stepped forward and asked Uncle why are you here ail smiled awkwardly his steps unsteady and replied isn't it because I was worried and wanted to check a bit in the end I got attracted by some strange things instead Yu thought to himself worried I think there might be another intention behind it last time you wanted the Modi map but didn't return it this Uncle is very secretive then he asked so did you find anything from this site evil answered of course there is he took out a stone and asked do you know what this is Yu replied it is a fragment of the world of stone ail exclaimed in surprise you know about this too then ail continued to ask since you recognize this object I think you also know that the world Stone contains the records and creation Rules of This World ail continued but do you know what its real effect is Yu replied couldn't be related to the world reboot ail exclaimed oh my that's good is there anything in this world you don't know he recounted in fact our world has long been divided into three factions conservatives restarters and wait and see conservatives Advocate maintaining the status quo preserving their own power and all resources are controlled by major corporations restarters consist of a dispersed team with a large number of people hoping to reset the world and return to the Earth Network era Whoever has the power to restart will dominate the world the weight and sea group remains neutral with no specific goals this organization is quite complex the vast majority are either individuals or collectives from the Wild Forces usually working for the two above factions to earn money but regardless of which side they are on they all chase after the fragments of the world of stone after all whether it's about reestablishing the world or maintaining the old regime this object holds significant benefits for them yigu smiled and asked wait a minute Uncle why did you suddenly mention the establishment of the world don't you feel anxious yeu continue although I am a bit surprised now that it has come to this I am very curious which faction does Uncle belong to have the last Back le Woo which faction do you hope I belong to Yu quickly guessed his intent he replied with a question isn't your question actually an opportunity to ask me which faction I belong to because if I belong to any faction I would surely hope to be with you ail laughed in Delight praising him smart you truly cannot be hidden no wonder you are the one chosen by old man mugue yugu replied in Surprise how could I be chosen by muw I have never met him ail explained this has nothing to do with meeting it's the old man's will entrusted in the map selecting you then he asked you woo did you see the content on the map y Wu responded um maybe Avil smiled and said then that's right wasn't I looking for you to borrow that map before that map in my eyes was just a blank screen yet you could see the content on the map which holds the will of old man mu way concealed within it yiu rested his chin on his hand and thought and said but the map only records a limited amount of information and detailed geography within a radius of 3,000 km while it does have its uses I have not detected any existence of will ail replied that shows you haven't researched deeply enough that old man is very cunning he has certainly hidden more important information within the map Yu curiously asked Uncle how you know so much what is your connection with mu way thinking of the past a replied I followed him for 20 years in the wild and one could consider me an unworthy disciple in his eyes y Wu exclaimed in Surprise disciple ofil recounted later on due to differing ideals I parted ways with him because that old man mui disapproved of the three existing factions and chose a completely new and arduous path the Reconstruction faction y Wu gently inquired reconstruction faction ail then explained the Reconstruction faction as its name implies aims to preserve everything that currently exists and build order upon the existing Foundation muw believes that even if an era is ushered in the dangers to the world will not end and the constraints will not be broken evil continued the current ERA while a risk of Extinction for Humanity is also a completely degenerated opportunity in this age humans not only have access to nearly Limitless nuclear energy but also possess scientific and technological advancements on different dimensional levels even magic therefore muw believes that the current unfavorable situation is entirely du be humans fighting amongst themselves with everyone failing to develop in a unified and well-planned manner what this world needs is not a restart but a truly powerful individual to guide everyone onto the right path yiwu showed surprise he thought to himself the central idea of this reconstruction faction aligns with the super safe Zone theory that I proposed doesn't it this can be seen as Heroes sharing the same aspirations ail continued previously I felt the old man's meeting was too Fantastical which is why I parted ways with him but my thoughts have changed now because I have encountered you ye woo you are the strong person that old man mu wayi has been searching for a versatile individual like you may indeed realize the old man's ideals this is something only you can accomplish y woo if you choose reconstruction as well I will do my utmost to support you saying that he gently placed a hand on Yu's shoulder and Yu smiled in response what I am doing now while consistent with mu's ideals does not extend to such long-term plans yiu continued I never thought about leading and controlling the development of the world aill encouraged it's okay there's no rush really no one can be sure about the future then he cheerfully put his arm around yiu and suggested after you finish your business here let's go back and continue drinking together ywu then asked by the way Uncle do you know the current whereabouts of mu ail replied no I don't know but I'm sure he's not dead because the old man is very strong incredibly strong the next day in the safe Zone a voice inquired senior did you call us here for something Yi Wu pointed to the system panels and said these weapons are for you to try out Ru and tan tan received a bright red magic St and excitedly exclaimed wow this staff is so beautiful holding it I can feel the immense power contained within what level of weapon is this y yanf received a bow in arrows she joyfully shouted this bow can shoot arrows without needing them I love it so much you're really good to me meanwhile Lu Fang received a sword he asked the senior can we really have such a Divine weapon he smiled and replied it's all good weapons like this I have plenty and they aren't too rare you just need to find one that feels right for you so with these Divine great weapons you guys should also level up a bit hearing that everyone happily took the weapons and left Ru and tyen tyan expressed her understanding we're going to level up I've been eager to try this Divine weapon Lu Fang smiled with excitement and said thank you so much senior let's go to the dungeon for the training match now I have both offense and defense this time I'm about to be the champion watching them leave Yu thought to himself next I should discuss the super safe Zone with moai suddenly a voice called from behind y woo he was surprised and asked why are you here and coming through the back door aren't you here to take revenge on me for eliminating hang Jen she replied hang Jen's existence or non-existence doesn't mean much to me without their restraints I'm even Freer I'm not here for that Yu then opened the system and smiled saying so you're here to pay me back you borrowed $ 200 million from me before this much is mostly interest for you at that moment the system notification appeared on susulu screen yiu transferred 230 million to you heulu immediately clicked on the decline button yiu wondered so what is your situation here Zulu replied I don't need this money anymore consider it payment for you I need you to help me with something youu asked something this task is worth 200 million it must be quite difficult right Sulu then made her request come with me to the next level 200 dungeon there is something I really desire inside level 200 May indeed be very challenging for an ordinary person but it should not be an issue for you right Sulu level 190 stepped out and stated according to the intelligence I have the entrance to the large type dungeon is located in the demon fiend Gorge near the dawn Fang area but the entrance to the dungeon is very special because it opens in two directions it means not only can we enter but the Demons Inside the dungeon can also pose a threat to the surroundings this dungeon is originally guarded by the Eastern region but recently they have finally decided to Counterattack starting to concentrate their troops for the first large scale assault on this dungeon while also opening the dungeon to the outside she continued the entire team and all individuals are willing to participate even the hired mercenaries can join so the Personnel for this Dungeon battle will be very mixed and the competition will be fierce this level 200 dungeon although dangerous also means that there will be incredibly Rich rewards inside besides the personal benefits for the dungeon Masters individuals or factions will also receive honor and Status granted by the east region upon defeating the final boss therefore this Dungeon battle is an opportunity that cannot be missed for those with skill Sulu looked at yiu and said I believe a person is greedy as you would refuse right he fell into a brief silence then she turned around and waved at him saying letun go we need to hurry on our way after all it's still very far when she saw he was still standing there she asked why are you still standing there yiu spoke up why are you so sure that I will definitely go I haven't said whether I want to go or not suu inquired further one more thing faced with such generous rewards don't tell me you will refuse as soon as she finished asking he replied yes I refuse she was astonished and exclaimed you what did you say then she ran around Yu and angrily asked why are you not really greedy for wealth you have no reason to refuse are you deliberately trying to annoy me you would suddenly be uninterested in money would you she continued it makes no sense or do you feel that the rewards of this dungeon are not enough he replied it has nothing to do with these things first you haven't revealed your true purpose second even if the compensation is generous I'm not available my super safe Zone plan has just started and I need to focus my energy on it moreover I have absolutely no interest in working for the east region Sulu thought to herself that's true he is really making a lot of sense I can't counter that for the moment she sighed and admitted all right I can tell you my real purpose for coming to this dungeon actually I'm here to kill someone he immediately asked who are you going to kill Sulu thought of that scientist and said I want to kill an old man named Juku he is the leading scientist in genetic research in the east region and he will also be coming to this dungeon upon hearing this yiu was somewhat interested and asked again isn't genetic gentic science an ancient science that has been lost Sulu responded not only genetic science there are many related studies of similar law Sciences in the east region Yi Wu inquired so do you have any enemity with the old man named Juku she was a bit annoyed and shouted I've said enough already if you are not willing to go then let's forget it pay me and I will find someone else he said if I am as important to you as that then it's not impossible for me to go but you must agree to two of my conditions suddenly Zulu came over and pressed a knife against his neck asking are you joking with me you clearly want to go yet not only do you want to pry into my secrets but you also want me to owe your lover Yu replied please don't be angry if it were only for money or benefits I truly would consider going but if it's a personal Grudge that needs to be resolved like yours then it's different moreover you seeking me proves that completing this task is very difficult previously I owed you a favor so naturally I must help you now hearing Yu's words suu felt a bit flushed and thought so that's how it is could it be that I have been shallow and misunderstood him he smiled as he pushed the knife away of course I cannot work for free first everything obtained in this dungeon must belong to me additionally after this matter concludes you must also join my formation she secretly blamed him it seems I wasn't wrong about him at all afterward she also accepted that the dungeon doesn't interest me you can have it all but for you to want me to join Han Mo that is absolutely out of the question after all I was once a part of Wong Jen even if Wong Jen Falls I cannot fight for the enemy that's just not my style Yu smiled and said it's not about joining hanm Mo it's about joining me she was a bit taken aback and asked what he continued why don't you listen to my vision of a super safe Zone first then make your decision Sulu hearing this immediately questioned what is this super safe Zone after Yu explained about the safe Zone she was extremely surprised and said what Yu do you really want to go this far is this really achievable no if what you're saying is true it might actually be possible Sulu thought to herself I never expected y Wu to have such distant Ambitions is this the ultimate reason for greed I really misjudged him then feeling a bit shy she said all right fine I support your ideals as long as you don't restrict my freedom I am willing to join Yu happily said then let's make that decision the two of them walked outside yiu pointed at the spaceship and said let's go we're setting off Sulu thought to herself in a short time his abilities and ambition have grown to this extent even I am starting to look forward to the limits of this man after all what is his limit as it was sulu's first experience riding in a fighter plane she excitedly shouted haa the feeling of being in the plane is truly amazing hearing that yiu expressed his thoughts while admiring the scenery below this feeling is completely different from flying on my own it's fresh thrilling and so interesting although he was focused on piloting yiu couldn't help but exclaim hearing this laughter it seems you are really excited I didn't expect the Ice Bird goddess to have such an admirable side if that's the case let's make her even happier suddenly out of nowhere a group of flying beasts appeared targeting the spaceship for an attack in response to the situation Sulu warned Yu be careful there are flying beasts ahead yiu calmly replied don't worry I'm here you just need to be happy and enjoy the thrill true to his word he immediately Unleashed his skill of the dragon eye which left shulu astonished wow the demon Beast is being teased by you Yoo how did you do that he explained this is an ancient special flying maneuver combined with the advanced capabilities of the fighter in my operations so that these demon beasts can expand their Horizons after that he executed the Falling Leaf flying mechanism skill Sulu asked exciting ye Woo you're really amazing what do we call this move now tricked by the skill the moner monsters screamed can't hit in the aircraft he further explained utilizing the Fighter's ability to turn with no radius or a small radius like a leaf falling from a tree maneuvering unpredictably to evade attacks upon hearing this the monsters became Furious one Beast roared danam we see you as food and you see us as materials to impress girls Brothers tear him apart for me but y wo calmly replied so what to experience the wisdom of our ancients is a privilege for you demon beasts Sulu enjoying the battle experience joyfully said it's amazing I love it thank you Yu you've given me such an exciting experience of aerial combat he simply responded as long as you're happy now next with a delighted smile he pulled the lever up and announced I'm about to accelerate she was fully excited yes yes outside the dungeon abyss of demon strife the monsters howled as they emerged from the gate one of them shrieked delicious flavor Fresh Living people hungry so hungry flesh brought to the mouth no reason not to eat I must chew them up why Shu when subordinates after dealing with the monsters asked Captain wasn't it said that this time it was a major dungeon but doesn't it seem a bit light someone next to him also voiced agreement that's right Captain they're even worried that something might happen above so they sent us here could it be an overreaction why Shu Wen shook his head and replied don't be careless you know lion uses all its strength to catch a rabbit the higher-ups arranged it this way for a reason no matter what we must remain cautious after a few minutes of fighting a subordinate reported Captain the demons at the dungeon entrance have been cleared why shuen nodded praising well done you've all worked hard suddenly Juku appeared from the dust cloud he angrily shouted you fools why sh when what have you done why did you kill them all my purpose for coming here was to study and gather important genes from the demons if you've killed them all what am I supposed to research despite being scolded why shuwen remained calm and patiently replied doctor don't be angry there are still unused samples in the dungeon we can go capture more don't worry too much about these small monsters but his thoughts were different it's really hard to serve that fat bastard what does he think he is if it worked for this mission of the Phoenix Cola team to protect him I wouldn't bother caring about him putting that aside he asked also the best doctor you better not casually mention the purpose of this trip of ours if Outsiders hear it it could be problematic Juku didn't care retorted so what if they hear he pointed at the others and said even if they know our purpose what does it matter do they understand what genetic materials are Advanced science has long been lost these unevolved monkeys won't comprehend it weu wien cautiously replied that's true lioen upon hearing this couldn't help but angrily scold stop talking nonsense we are the mercenary Brigade The Wild King's Destiny at the end of the century ranked fifth in the Eastern Wasteland we have no interest in any god-forsaken genetic materials the effect had the brothers cheering Captain is mighty Captain is mighty he added we only need money and tools never thought of competing with you guys Juku cunningly said a smart decision but deep down he scoffs monkeys are just monkeys provoking them casually is all that's needed these fools can't read a few words they will never understand the true value of demonic genetic materials Li sh Shen looked at Queen's team and casually remarked a group of beautiful girls like this entering the lair of a demon is quite dangerous it's better to wait outside until we go in and earn a lot of money then we can take you all out guofen hearing this brandished her whip threateningly feeling that nothing irritates women more than rude men like them I really look forward to that but after you guys go in it's likely you'll go in and not return it's still better for us to go in ourselves earning money is easier that way Li shev Shen ched heartily his eyes sparkling with interest a person meant to be scolded like him felt thrilled upon hearing this you girls are really fiery I like the type like you a lot she replied in the end whether it's burning hot or the pain from the whip it depends on whether your small body can withstand the trampling while they were flirting with each other Yu's aircraft descended sending a cloud of dust flying everywhere everyone couldn't help but exclaim cough cough cough oh my the dust is too much my newly bought gear is all dirty now the first time I wear it and instead of getting stained with monster blood it's covered in dirt because someone is showing off who doesn't have Karma like this we came here to raid dungeons to earn money and before we could even earn anything we're already eating dirt culu stepped down smiling and praising you've arrived so quickly this is much faster than flying by myself y woo next time I have the chance take me flying again Yu also stepped down nodding in response sure just wait until you join me there will be plenty of opportunities this scene made Li sh Shen unable to suppress his contempt scolding damn with this lineup I thought someone important was coming turns out it's just a kid trying to flirt you two dare to come challenge a level 200 dungeon If You're just showing off to impress a girl get lost the guy next to him chimed in his voice full of mockery that's right this kid is so eager to show off in front of of a girl that he doesn't even care about his life anymore it's a shame such a beautiful girl would go along with him and end up throwing her life away unlike Li sha Shen's attitude why shuen appeared excited commenting ah it's this guy previously I wanted to kill him to steal the ancient but Sho chin stopped me now he's delivering himself right to me this time I won't miss the opportunity meanwhile sulu's gaze was fixated on Juku causing yiu to feel puzzled in curious the look this woman gives me isn't friendly at all but why does she seem so familiar like I've seen her somewhere before never mind the most important thing right now is to get the evil demon the other stuff isn't important but if you keep staring at me be careful I might use your beautiful eyes for an experiment right now y Wu observed her expression and remarked this fat guy only has a level of 150 yet he makes Sulu feel so apprehensive it seems he is hiding a lot of strength guofan seductively looked at Yu and smiled handsome I hope we can cooperate well in the dungeon upon hearing this Yu couldn't help but be astonished when he saw a familiar face in the team he instinctively thought is that biku why is she here not only has she disguised her name and personal information but she is also pretending not to know me what is her purpose after thinking for a long time y Wu felt increasingly uneasy wait a minute Su suu both of them have appeared now the secret relationship between these two might be unraveled in the dungeon jugu stood in front of everyone waved his hand to signal and said loudly I won't repeat the rules again you must remember that once you step into this dungeon entrance your lives are your own responsibility don't come crying and begging for help later everyone shouted excitedly of course don't dawle anymore fat man I'm so eager let's get into to the dungeon however luck was not on their side as soon as they set foot inside the entire team immediately encountered the boss Monaco gluty everyone said in unison as soon as we stepped into the dungeon we encountered a boss which frightened everyone what kind of operation is this Juku filled with knowledge reassured everyone Don't Panic although it's a boss it seems to lack high level intelligence this ugly form is not the perfect magical orb I want to take quickly deal with it then continue searching for a more ideal specimen Li shaen although not fond of taking orders from others nodded in agreement it may look like this but if it's a boss the rewards will surely be substantial guofan immediately spoke up to criticize this boss looks too disgusting I'll leave it to you guys we Shu win side also agreed the Phoenix Cola team has no interest in this boss either you guys are free to handle it he thought to himself self if it weren't for the master wanting it we certainly wouldn't have to take action with such a foolish person hiring others to clear the way we have more time on our hands seeing everyone refuse L show Shen didn't hesitate to charge forward you all said it yourself don't go back on your words I am not the kind of vas like you all the first boss in this dungeon belongs to me now the group immediately echoed senior is mighty senior is unmatched in wisdom and courage the team me wo still calmly discussed among themselves I predict the battle in this dungeon will probably last a long time because previously I read in a book that the people from the Western continent divided human desires into seven types Pride Envy anger laziness greed gluttonous rage and lust gluttonous rage is one of them if the demon boss in this dungeon is categorize like that then there will be at least seven bosses he glanced at susulu and S So to avoid any unexpected situations do we want to deal with Juku here and now upon hearing this she immediately refuse no if we just kill him like that it would be too easy for him I must strike when he is joyfully thinking he has achieved his goal he must endure despair from both his body and his heart y Wu respected her decision nodding follow your intuition after all I promise to help you as long as you feel the time is right I will act he looked at her and added but I am really curious what kind of deep hatred do susulu and Juku have seeing her angry he sighed and gave up but if she is unwilling to bring it up herself I don't need to press her it's enough to silently support her returning to the Battlefield shaan's team joyfully shouted senior this boss is about to go down it looks like we are about to claim the main reward for the first kill seeing the opportunity shok Shen commanded everyone quickly step back I will deal it the final killing blow the might they displayed made others exclaim in admiration no wonder they are the fifth ranked mercenary Brigade in the Eastern Wasteland their coordination with this boss fight is exceptional can we stumble into the wrong place should we join them a person next to them said earlier judging by their appearance I thought they looked absolutely unreliable I didn't expect their actual combat experience and teamwork to be so high compliment continued the poor boss has barely appeared and is already facing such a fierce encirclement it's almost down before it even got out but after the recent bear the boss still had 10% Health left causing shaen to be astonished oh no it's still alive but no matter it has lost too much health everyone let's finish it off before they could attack it exhibited strange Behavior prompting everyone to shout senior something's wrong with this boss why is it starting to eat its own kind after a hearty meal the boss has now entered a new phase this Evolution has instilled fear in everyone it is covered in blood recovering and has leveled up to a new tiar what's going on here before the words could finish it Unleashed its devour skill replacing the fear-filled words with please don't help senior save us the situation became even more perilous causing shaen to Bow his head and plead hey what are you all doing just watching this damn everyone is here to raid the dungeon but I'm the only one risking my life upon hearing this others mocked him weren't you the one telling us not to intervene he was infuriated shouting damn is the situation now the same as before this boss has mutated if we wait until it eats us all you will be next the heroic Spirit of the Phoenix Cola team ralli to encourage now's not the time to argue the properties of this boss seem to grow stronger the more it devours if we continue to ignore it we will also fall into a dangerous predicament everyone rallied together teammates shouted Brothers follow the captain so we can teach these country bumpin what real teen fighting is seeing whyu went launching an attack the Queen's team panicked and reported the big sister of the Phoenix Cola team is striking hearing this someone from the fayen team shouted in order all ladies support them today we'll let those useless men claim to our skirts the scene of this battle made the onlookers cheer look three great battle teams are working together to surround the boss the boss is being suppressed once again we the bad guys must step up we can't let others look down on us seeing everyone rushing in shunu turned to Yu her voice filled with curiosity I have no demands for this dungeon which is why I don't want to intervene uselessly but what about you aren't you going participate the rewards for the top Nine Kills of the boss are pretty generous with your personality you definitely wouldn't want to pass that up yuu shook his head and replied calmly not rushing let them work for me a while longer when the boss's Health drops to 10% could you help me chop it into pieces no larger than a meatloaf upon hearing this Zulu couldn't help but be surprised I have no problem doing that but they've already beaten the boss down to this point and it can still recover why do you want me to do something pointless like that Yi Wu confidently stated you just need to follow my instructions in the end the boss was left with only 10% Health seeing this everyone increased their attack and shouted the boss's health is only down to 10% is it about to enter gluttonous rage everyone step back be careful not to let it eat you before they could Retreat the boss was shredded into pieces byi witnessing this scene they screamed in panic oh my what is this this woman doing does she want to rob the boss however when they saw the boss starting to heal Shu Shan mocked so na such an attack simply has no effect she clearly witnessed me taking damage earlier yet she still refuses to believe it Shu went quickly considered and commanded this woman wants to sabotage hurry back if she gets eaten by the boss it will recover once again without hesitation y Wu utiliz the skill devouring the heavens and earth black little cave before everyone's eyes a strange black hole appeared swallowing the boss before it could fully recover immediately the system announced boss Monaco gluttony has been killed the first kill belongs to ywu hearing the familiar sound the soldiers shouted this dungeon still brings system notifications another first kill gone a series of notifications appeared received 10 million experience 5 million gold obtained an endless void bag an epic level equipment that can increase the item capacity collected 10 units of touching the extreme taste which has a strange flavor and lingering aftertaste each tentacle eaten can restore 100% HP increases strength by 30% accompanied by a hunger status lasting 1 minute Fang of gluttony an epic level equipment a claw made from the fangs of the gluttonous rage demon extremely sharp instantly tears apart enemies increases armor penetration by 30% % reduces the opponent's defense by 20% after hearing this everyone exclaimed oh my God what on Earth just happened Yu stepped out from his skill calmly remarked gluttonous rage is nothing special my taste is still greater shaan's group spoke up oh it turns out to be this showoff shaen angrily cursed I worked hard to defeat the boss and lost Health only to have you use that weird trick to steal a monster do you want to die seeing this he advised senior don't waste your breath on him everyone let's surround and kill him with a proud demeanor he smugly said isn't this dungeon supposed to be open to everyone everyone competes for the boss based on their abilities isn't that the old rule his words made shf Shen go even crazier Dan you really think too highly of yourself huh it seems that unless I take action you won't know how much you weigh you want talk about rules well right now I find you unpleasant to look at killing you won't break any rules seeing that the other teammates weren't joining the fight he suddenly thought wait that's not right after being robbed of the monster the Phoenix Cola team and the people from the Queen's team showed no reaction to this guy's provocations he squinted to investigate with the Instinct honed over years of Monster hunting in the wild there must be some hidden danger here what is this kid's background to stand alone against everyone and still maintain his composure there must definitely be something going on it's better for me to not act rashly the system chimed in again kill the demon gluttonous rage trigger the account linked to that man special Mission kill 100,000 demons he was taken AB back by this announcement what I have to kill 100,000 demons are you kidding me seeing the powerful man on the screen y Wu anxiously asked the system 100,000 demons are there really enough demons in this dungeon to kill 100,000 the system immediately replied oh killing one boss is equivalent to killing 5,000 demons y Wu further question with such a deadlock doesn't it mean we have to kill through the entire dungeon to reach 100,000 demons the system responded exactly to accumulate a kill count of 100,000 demons you must Traverse and defeat the dungeon if you switch to that man's account you can enhance damage and optimize benefits When Exterminating demons the system continued to guide make sure to use finishing moves to kill demons these moves will help accumulate the Elegance index and the fear index of the Demons these indices will increase based on rating levels classified from low to high a total of seven levels D CB a s SS SSS the system went on to explain the Elegance index along with the fear index of the Demons can be converted to boost damage the maximum damage can increase up to 500% finally it added additionally if you use that man's account to kill 100,000 demons you can unlock the upgrade for the demon Destroyer account after giving instructions the system added the demon Destroyer can take advantage of the demon blood Ruby obtained in the realm of the Gods Allen guard to enter the equatorial demon latitude this is the stronghold of all demons a mid-level dungeon of the demon type if this dungeon an ancient type of demon is the final boss hearing this information ye Wu became even more excited he said an ancient is connected to another ancient although killing 100,000 demons sounds Troublesome aiming for this reward I have to clear the dungeon the atmosphere grew tense some frightened by his Aura turned to ask L show Shen in fear senior should we still take action against him Lia Shen shouted what action should we take then he thought to himself as the saying goes a shooting bird sticks its head out if other forces do not act against this guy I won't be the first to touch this Misfortune damn just endure it in another Corner why shuen looked at y Wu his gaze deep in thought he quietly considered the leader of the east region entrusted us with the task of protecting Juku there is no need for an internal conflict at this moment it's not too late to settle accounts with this brat after clearing the level the announcement echoed killing a boss will officially close the teleportation gate after killing the remaining six bosses the teleportation gate to the dungeon will be opened each time a boss is killed there will be a 30-second delay after the delay ends the boss's attributes will increase by 10% and the attributes of minions will increase by 5% thus the one who kills the final boss will have the right to control the entire dungeon they will have the power to decide the fate of all life within the dungeon including both demons and participants upon hearing this the crowd erupted with reactions are you kidding if that's the case this dungeon has hellish difficulty why bother fighting in contrast someone exclaimed cheerfully all life in the dungeon not just us but even those demons count too if we can kill the final boss wouldn't that make us a God we could control the entire demon Army to do our bidding shaen frowned thinking damn the difficulty of this dungeon is indeed monstrous but the rewards are equally tempting I like it he glanced around secretly plotting damn let's take the risk if I want pleasure I have to go all out money women demons I will take all goof fan chuckled coldly her eyes gleaming with a sense of satisfaction the power to control everything H aha interesting just wait until I seiz that power I will kill all the men here this world doesn't need men at all it would be best if all of them died thinking of this she revealed a chilling smile but y woo perhaps it won't be too late to kill him after he's played around on the other side shuen glanced at y woo a cunning smile creeping on her lips in her mind she secretly thought as long as we gain control of the dungeon no matter what tricks that brat uses he won't be able to do anything to Us kid your time of freedom is running out this time there won't be anyone like XA Chen to protect you in the dark corner a Sinister figure whispered to himself the control of this dungeon will surely belong to me this living laboratory was indeed created for me aha I will turn all of them into materials for my research and transformation ywu stood silently his gaze calm yet sharp as if seeing through the entire scheme unfolding around him he thought to himself seeing their Twisted eyes the dungeon hasn't even opened yet and already plotting against each other this is truly a hellish dungeon embodying all seven deadly sins mastering people's hearts is truly impeccable am turned to Kulu and said it seems we no longer have a way to turn back now she replied that suits my intentions her face clearly showed determination as she said this time no one can escape I must take control of this dungeon for my own purposes adding an extra layer of security her actions made him unexpectedly think sunu has always been calm Yet full of resentment this is not normal putting aside her hatred for Juku this dungeon seemed to magnify human emotions triggering all the darker sides suddenly shuin proclaimed everyone starting from now it's best if we split up and act each team will go kill their own boss then control the time to delay for 30 seconds and at the same time try to kill multiple bosses he continued that way the cumulated enhancement of the next boss's attributes will be only 10% thus reducing the difficulty of the dungeon recalling the battle with the previous boss he excitedly added the best scenario is that we can simultaneously kill all the remaining bosses then he advised everyone of course if anyone feels their team cannot defeat a boss alone they can suggest teaming up with another team to take down a boss shaen showing a contemptuous attitude replied that's right we are a big team with many people while you only have two I think aside from picking up scraps you probably don't know how to do anything else tisk tick Tech how about this as long as you kneel down and beg I will consider taking you along the group outside also chimed in with laughter loudly saying aha senior you truly are great Sulu spoke softly her tone cold empty head people love to point fingers at the world Fierce Tigers always acted alone it's absurd to form alliances with your performance just now are you planning to team up to offer your lives sorry I might be saying too much but with your level you probably don't even understand what I'm saying he was unconvinced and shouted I think you're tired of living suddenly someone rushed in from outside to report senior there's a new discovery the disciple who ran over was pointing behind him out of breath as he said following your instructions I surveyed the surroundings the result is besides us and the bad people I found that there are other people there he was startled and shouted what are you saying shuen was stunned unable to believe other people it can't be the dungeon teleport gate has already closed wait could it be that someone entered the dungeon before us he commanded go quickly go take a look upon arrival they saw a group of zombies sitting around a formation they exclaimed in unison this is is look at the mummies Bound in red Crystal they were taken AB back and shouted blood sacrificed demon Essence Frozen dry corpses what a dreadful scene is this suddenly yeu spoke up ancient Lord's Advent Society I never expected to encounter them here the group surrounding the formation muttered damn what bad luck encountering them again the members of the ancient Lord's Advent Society are a bunch of lunatics none of them are normal these people act without reasoning their beliefs are cruel and extreme they can be regarded as the depraved ones of the apocalyptic era Juku approached one of the corpses interesting interesting these dry corpses must be over a 100 years old how could they not Decay like this suddenly he noticed a hole in the corpse oh this is he thought to himself the back of the corpse has a hole it seems something has come out from Within These dry corpses is this the reason they haven't decayed this dungeon is more intriguing than I expected the others were excited to hear him talk about the corpses over a hundred years old these people have been here for over a hundred years but what exactly did they come here to create the students said who knows about this in our east region we only hear about the evildoings of the ancient Lord's Advent society and we haven't had any direct contact with them why Shu pondered could it be that they want to summon demons Yu replied no the goal of the ancient Lord's Advent Society is not to summon demons but to summon ancients the demons are probably just the results of their failed summing attempts furthermore I suspect that there are still six summing formations corresponding to the six remaining bosses why Shu win was taken AB what are you saying that the members of the ancient Lord's Advent Society have summoned seven demon bosses in this dungeon and they still want to summon ancients y Wu nodded yeah that's right why Shu W frowned unconvinced what nonsense do you even know what ancients really are the ancient Lords Advent Society summing ancients that's just crazy talk yet deep down wi Shu went thought does this guy want to scare someone unfortunately our east region has already delt deeply into research on ancients the ancient Lord's Advent Society absolutely cannot summon ancients he couldn't help but chuckle a bit perhaps the abilities of the ancient Lord's Advent of Society have surpassed your understanding in the east region I was once in the southwestern safe Zone and saw them summon a part of the ancient body upon hearing this the group tensed up like a drawn bow string what the ancient Lord's Advent Society can really summon the ancient and you actually saw the ancient with your own eyes even way shu's expression darkened I didn't expect this guy to have such extraordinary experiences how many Secrets is he hiding in the future I must be extremely cautious when dealing with him his own Spirit was uneasy as he contemplated this issue the current situation truly exceeds my comprehension the existence of the ancient Lord's Advent Society has lasted for over a hundred years but how did they know there was an ancient here it seems there must be someone very powerful within that organization this organization is no longer simply an apocalyptic cult as previously understood in the future we will definitely have to be more wary of them Lia Shen group grew impatient and walked over to knock on the essence Stone you cultural folks only know how to show off what's the point of discussing this if these dry corpses are all over a 100 years old then what's there to fear instead of wasting time discussing this cult shouldn't we quickly split up and take action to resolve it what about the remaining boss he kicked the essence Stone hard with a straight leg causing the corpse to fall corpse bye-bye I'm off to fight the boss now the essence Stone shattered blood and corpses gushed out from within like a flood he panicked and yelled oh my God what is this Juku hurriedly tried to stop him but was too late you idiot don't casually touch things around here he forced a smile trying to evade responsibility I didn't expect this thing to be so fragile if it's broken it's broken what can be done about it before the words were out of his mouth the ground suddenly shook violently making it hard for everyone to stand firm shaen looked around and said sternly what is this again from the ground a Decay arm shot up followed by countless other arms the horrifying scene sent the crowd into a panic everyone be careful back away quickly something is crawling up from the ground as everyone ran for their lives he remained still someone kindly reminded him kid what are you standing there for if you want live run now Yu showed no signs of panic Panic even standing there analyzing this summoning formation is not simple seems like there are living beings buried underground used for ancient sacrifices in no time the undead flooded the entire area people were fleeing in every direction holy crap it really can break out as mutated living beings he frowned and murmured the ancient Lord's Advent Society is indeed not a good thing another voice chimed in stop lamenting there are too many mutations let's leave this cramped space first and then talk why shuen brandished his sword chopping the zombies into pieces then shouted a bunch of cowards with this little courage and strength you dare to come into the dungeon to watch the excitement but then something surprising happened the chopped up zombies were still moving causing y Shu wind to panic and step back what the hell is this even being chopped to bits they can still live at the same time someone else was careless and was attacked by a zombie screaming in fear H it's sucking my blood help me someone help me aha the people around were not spared from such a fate either the screams of Despair rang out mixed with desperate struggles damn what's going on regardless of whether the monsters can kill we can't just sit here and wait for death Counterattack Counterattack now meanwhile Sulu was equally tense the battle raged fiercely she furrowed her brow her face darkening commenting bloodthirsty yet can't be killed these guys are really hard to deal with on the other side he turned to ask the system for confirmation system does this mutated monster count within the range of 100,000 demons the system replied succinctly counts suddenly Li shoen rushed towards him driving a horde of zombies behind as he arrived he shouted damn kid you're not putting in any effort just standing there staring at the sky you pissing your pants and too scared to move he laughed hardly and continued I'll lure the monsters over here toughen you up don't be polite when he saw the zombies surrounding him he sneered haha foolish aren't you today I will expose you you are nothing but a pretender above you woo a large metal rod appeared from his position a massive surge of electricity erupted turning the zombies into dust Lia Chan was left in shock stammering my God what just happened Yu spoke up don't worry I will definitely take action it's just a bit unfortunate the system update weapon cage successfully delivered the system announced the host has successfully transferred to that man's account please pay attention to the blood lust of the account you are equipped with Advanced armor and heavy Weaponry he loaded his weapon excitedly saying this small number of demons isn't even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth but that's okay he began to charge forward to attack his Battle Cry coing the demon hunting Feast begins now she smirked stepping on the man lying on the ground the system warned using this man's account for an extended period will accumulate a large amount of blood lust you need to use the skills to release it on the battlefield otherwise it will build up into a bloodthirsty rage host please unleash it whole heartedly meanwhile Yi Wu was enthusiastically firing at the monsters laughing loudly get hi from me the score doesn't matter right now one hand he shot the other hand chopped the monsters to Pieces coldly stating is this all you've got not enough not enough fun the score right now is eight while handling the monsters he provocatively taunted come on gather around me I will kill all of you demons leaving no one behind Lulu was using ice manipulation to control the demons one of them shouted she is cleaning up the monsters for us senior this is clearly looking down on our Phoenix Cola team he glanced at Yu realized the reason and continued no she's helping that kid gain our monsters y woo spinning around shooting the demons cheerfully said that's more like it just keep rushing towards me that way I can kill more and have more fun the score is now 55 the battle was becoming more intense with the current score at 555 Yun Jong he stood in the cave looking out saw the two of them and thought to himself tesk ye woo and that woman really work well together it's annoying why do I feel this strange sense of jealousy I must hold it back I have more important things to do why shuwen was astonished and thought to himself although I knew this person was not simple from the start I didn't expect him to be this strong I absolutely must not underestimate him anymore in the future I need to come up with a more thorough plan to deal with him one of his underlings came over and said senior they are stealing our monsters again oh my God they are about to steal all monsters hearing that he was extremely angry gritting his teeth and saying if they want compete for the monsters then let them compete after all our mission this time is to protect Dr Juku so let's consider them as workers cleaning up the monsters for us the system announced but little monsters of the evil demon type in this area have been completely cleared all of which were killed by the host a total of 660 the two listened and felt somewhat pleased the system continued final evaluation SSS rewarded with an additional 20% of Glamour stats and fear stats of the demon Yu's face grew Grim as he thought to himself 665 this is truly pushing a person with a condition to the Limit he thought of someone and continued to think I remember there was a cruel Emperor an ancient the West who was considered an incarnation of a demon his name corresponded with the number in ancient text as 666 and thus he was viewed by the westerners as a symbol of evil Yu frown thought for a moment and then continued so the number of demons here must be missing one more at that moment the dry corpses kneeling began to tremble one person shouted look over were there the dry corpses around the formation seemed to be moving these corpses continuously recited incantations emitting a strange red light around them another person anxiously said these corpses seem to be chanting some kind of spell I can't understand it the formation is starting to Glow do you see anything a strange light is absorbing all the corpses around here another person continued to scream in fear oh my this pull is sucking all the corpses away so bizarre I have a bad feeling about this just then a demon appeared it had a body resembling a centipede with the upper half of a woman's body on top it was aveston the one filled with Envy it laughed loudly and shouted ancient has finally taken care of us my God this dense power a body so strong is this the power that was granted to us I knew we were different we are not an aberration we are the ones chosen by the gods we no longer need to fear that person aveston recalled a woman with pink hair and said mu way the name of that Relentless pursuer she almost wiped us out my God just mentioning that name makes me feel disgusted don't you feel the same way avestin raised his face to the sky and shouted loudly this feeling of this Dreadful age is still continuing it's disgusting so disgusting but in the end we no longer need to fear her Pursuit oh God thank you for granting us strength thank you for granting us courage y Wu upon hearing that name was somewhat surprised thinking to himself mu way that name sounds a lot like the MU way no right but surely it can't be the same person can it why shuen was no less astonished exclaiming loudly isn't mu way the one who suppressed the demon Beast 500 years ago one of the five Heroes who brought peace to humanity I never expected the name of a hero recorded in the historical Archives of the east region could be heard from the mouth of this monster Yu frowned thinking about mu and mumbling mu way Mo way just hearing the name alone makes it clear that there must be some connection between the two a 100 years ago if we consider the timing could they be siblings or mother and child avestin continued to shout loudly what year is it now ancient Lord's Advent Society are we dominating the world should we welcome the ancient and former Rising Sun Glory Li show Shen laughed loudly and said not awake yet Dan still trying to dominate the world I don't know how crazy your ancient Lord's Advent Society was 100 years ago but now you are just a bunch of rats that everyone is hunting down hearing that it became extremely angry charged forward and shouted what our red vow has not yet been fulfilled how could it be how could it be useless ants you have occupied the world for a hundred years it's not like I envy you and eny the guys below quickly shouted back in response Envy my ass do you have any idea how hard we live in this world stop with the nonsense aren't you just a Boss Brothers let's kill it you who looked up at the sky and saw a crack thinking to himself that behind this boss there was an otherworldly Rift the system then announced ordinary people cannot see only the host with the demon blood Ruby can see behind aveston a very large red eye appeared everyone also looked up thinking this is the eye of the ancient demon what does it want y Wu stared directly at the eye in front of him contemplating this overwhelming sense of Oppression being in my account state right now is making it hard to breathe under the pressure of an ancient Demon's eye he looked at the strange state of everyone their movements had stopped they must not see the ancient demon it seems that the one who has stopped is me I must have been pulled into this space Hong is left alone now a voice emanated from the eye how can someone as lowly as you possess the demon blood Ruby a lowly ant like you is Unworthy of having it but now that I have discovered you your life will not last much longer however if you obediently return the demon blood Ruby to me perhaps I might consider allowing you to become a member of the demon Yu replied becoming a demon is unnecessary but do not worry I will take the demon blood Ruby and find you the eye questioned find me you are quite delusional it is not easy to find me a lowly ant like you can accomplish that yiu folded his arms and said you need not worry about this I have my own ways you just need to sincerely wait until the moment you kneel before me to acknowledge me as your master and pledge your loyalty the ey could not believe it it was stunned kneeling to acknowledge you as my master is this a joke from a lowly creature you are quite interesting I will look forward to your arrival if you can survive until that moment y wo stood still thinking this ancient being is so concerned about the demon blood Ruby it seems that this Blood gem is not simple it not only serves the function of a key but surely also hides some secrets that I do not get know previously I chose the blood gem from their treasure Vault the father of God is indeed wise time had been restored aveston at level 220 was excitedly slashing at foes God can you hear it the sound of the bodies being torn apart of those who do not believe in you is ringing out how wonderful it is the remaining ones quickly shouted the boss fight has begun those who are skilled step up to defend we Shu W charged forward commanding the Phoenix Cola team maintain formation it's time to showcase our team's strength follow me let's draw the boss's hatred the three others responded understood senior guofen not wanting to be outdone immediately sprung into action calling for her sisters to assist she thought the boss is not defeated yet my objective is still unfinished I cannot let these stinky men die here right now lioen also couldn't sit still and rushed forward damn it Brothers hurry and follow me don't let the Phoenix Cola team take everything you all need to remember to support me he silently thought I missed out on the opportunity to kill a boss last time this time I must seize it Juku observed from behind and laughed these mercenaries have some skill after all they manag to survive in the dangerous Easter region without relying on the east region shallia way don't finish it off too quickly wait until the boss's Health goes down to 5% and then stop I'm interested in its genes it's important research material shuen replied understood however in his heart he silently cursed our mission is just to protect prot you that damn fat guy thinks of us as servants I will definitely take the credit for this boss down shuen reminded everyone don't let your guard down we must maintain the boss's aggro tightly his subordinates responded Captain don't worry we will keep the bosses aggro tight and we will take down anyone else suddenly Yi Wu appeared out of nowhere wielding a chainsaw to attack the monster he teased well that's not certain the way you guys are attacking the aggro builds up way too slowly does the aggro need to last like this the monster groan from the attack it hurts so much I am protected by the gods why can I still feel this excruciating pain the monster switched its aggro angrily shouting stop right there I will definitely devour you alive shuen was cursing at this bastard but Yu ignored the insults he said you can't blame me for this if you want to blame someone blame your paper thin hatred index a single stab and it shatters the Phoenix Cola team could not refute this one member of the team even had to agree wow he makes a lot of sense we can't respond that right now Sulu and yiu worked together causing the monster's Health to drop to 58% fan side these two coordinate so well it's nearly perfect if there's a chance I really want to teach these two a lesson the monster being relentlessly attacked howled jukun why haven't you all gone to die yet being able to push me to this point I will definitely not let you off the monster Unleashed a wide range attack with numerous claws rising from the ground that caused many to lose their lives one person screamed Heavens the boss released an area of attack ignoring hatred damn this is like Gods fighting while Mortals get Dragged In screams of Despair echoed everywhere shaen was sweating thinking damn I was careless I didn't expect the boss's Health to drop below 50% and start unleashing his ultimate move fan also furrowed his brows panicking could it be caused by that kid's hatred and attacks exceeding the limit the monster laughed mockingly how about this move of mine because you have caused so many people to die how do you feel does your conscience reproach you y Wu deflected the blow and asked in return does your conscience reproach you are you joking you are respons for your own life regardless of whether you are trapped or implicated in the end you can only blame yourself shaen exclaimed an astonishment that kid is insane Shuan began to attack he is not wrong the survival law of this world has always been like this Stop Standing their days everyone move out don't give the boss a chance to unleash its ultimate move the remaining monster with 20% Health left roared frantically why after hundreds of years have humans developed such selfish individuals why has the great love of the ancient Lord's Advent Society not been carried forward clearly the ancient Lord's Advent Society could make this world better why have you selfishly ridiculed it the shout paralyzed the minds of those around shuen immediately realized this is a mental attack the body is paralyzed unable to move the monster continued to scold Your Existence is a disrespect to the countless teammates who willingly dedicated themselves to re build the glory of the ancient Lord's Advent Society die the crowd motionless and fearful moaned damn surprisingly Yu was unaffected and even managed to withstand the Fatal blow he said I am a crude person unable to comprehend the great love you speak of moreover this great love is proclaimed from the mouth of the ancient Lord's Advent Society don't you find it laughable Sulu feeling grateful for being saved looked at ywu and said woo the monster astonished remarked you can still move how are you not paralyzed mentally y wo cly replied no need to be surprised don't think you're the only one with a trump card coincidentally I also have a few tricks up my sleeve I possess a tool that grants immunity to mental control the monster laughed loudly excited and said very good among this crowd only you are worthy enough to be my opponent next I really want to drill into your head and fill it with great love that way you will understand its meaning haha Yi Wu pondered his strategy do to the Gap in levels the actual effectiveness of my mental immunity tool is only 60% therefore I need to win swiftly y Wu quickly lured the monster avarest and envy away Juku shouted angrily kid what are you doing it's an important experimental material for me inside Juku was constantly in anguish damn it although I have modified my body I still can't be immune to the boss's mind control fortunately even if my body can't move my Consciousness remains awake despite avarest and envy closely chasing after him Yu answered leisurely you can still maintain your Consciousness that's quite impressive but asking me what I'm doing isn't that already obvious after saying that yiu raised his hand to the sky and snapped his fingers a stream of golden light quickly swirled around him several times causing the Earth and rocks to fly everywhere he thought to himself this place is far enough from the crowd now next I'll use that technique to resolve the issue from the sky a streak of light shot straight down to the ground Aviston bore the full brunt of a close-range orbital bombardment screaming in pain the ground cracked open dece flying up due to the immense force of the impact Juku was astonished unable to believe his eyes he gasped amazed this this is a real gun it can't be satellite weapons have long become debris in space how can it still be operational y woo with his hands in his pockets calmly observe each lightning strike descending the Earth and rocks chattering everywhere he smirked saying nonchalant no wonder the Eastern researcher holds the techniques of the Ancients your knowledge is indeed quite Rich at that moment the system announced the account is linked to M's Madness the orbital close- range artill support skill has been completed cool down time 4 hours Juku was so Furious that the veins on his forehead bulge roaring in anger I don't care about your background you dare to kill my important experimental material you're dead for sure but the monster still covered in blood slowly stood up it let out a low horse grown it's too hot too painful yiwu stared intently at the creature before him then smiled faintly kill isn't this boss still alive and well which of your eyes saw me kill it Juku was no longer angry instead A Satisfied smile appeared on his face he replied it seems you've reached your limit too haven't you consider yourself lucky the boss hasn't die yet otherwise you'll be the next one to die in his heart Juku was also thinking he knows that the combination of demons and humans is rare but only when using living entities does it hold value once they die they turn into a useless pile of Flesh the control had also been lifted the group of people who had been frozen were gradually regaining their ability to move Lio Shen turned to look at averton unable to contain his curiosity damn it what just happened it feels like I lost Consciousness he looked toward the boss muttering what luck the boss was nearly out of Health yet got this lucky seizing the opportunity Li shoen swung his sword and charged straight at the monster with just a few Swift strikes the creature's body was sliced into pieces lioen laughed triumphantly meat served right to the mouth and if I don't eat it I'm either a fool or blind the credit for taking down this boss is mine now haha the announcement echoed again boss jealousy has been defeated first killer L shaen reward 1,000 experience points and 5 million gold coins I've this whispered a report into Yi Wu's ear the host receives 1/5 of the experience for killing the boss and 1,000 demons yiu smiled with satisfaction Li shoen upon hearing this excitedly turned to celebrate with his teammates haha the credit for the boss came so suddenly A Mir Riot of experience 5 million we're making a fortune this time indeed I am the chosen one by the heavens the subordinates did not forget to flatter wow even we are are promoted by five levels the boss is truly capable however Juku was trembling with rage grinding his teeth he spoke up full of indignation do you even know what you just did you dared to kill the crucial research material of mine he turned sharply commanding why shuen kill all these blind fools for me shuen quickly intervened doctor please calm down absolutely do not fall for that kid scheme he lowered his voice speak speaking softly into Juku ear Li sh Shen deliberately killed the boss to level up closing the gap between the mercenary troops and aric team his aim is to instigate internal strife Among Us pausing for a moment shuen continued that Yu is not an ordinary guy it is not the right time for direct conflict with him yet we should use him as a Pioneer letting him clear the monsters first only then will we find the opportunity to deal with him upon hearing this jugu pondered and nodded what you say makes sense we will do it that way for now still in his heart he remained Furious mumbling vwu sooner or later I will conduct a series of experiments on you turning you into my most prized specimen Juku approached the group of people pointing and commanding all right let's start splitting up and act according to the plan to take down the bosses currently the five remaining bosses have increased their attributes by 10% we need to kill the them all at the same time immediately they divided into two groups of men and women the leader of the male group shouted all right guys follow me to the north and kill as you please those who want to join my team hurry up and follow the female group was not to be outdone one person in the group loudly declared sisters we're heading south keep your distance from those men who are just boasting why shuen looked at Yi Wu and culu then asked I'll take charge of the East so can the two of you handle the west but with only two people can you guarantee that you won't drag everyone else down Yu replied nonchalant instead of worrying about us you should worry about yourselves first let's go Sulu on the western side of the dungeon even counting could be heard steadily 1,1 1200 1500 the player heading west had already defeated 1,898 demons the monsters lay scattered along the way woo walked while listening to the notification in her ear the player accumulates in the dungeon has defeated 8,898 demons following behind y Wu Sulu was silent for a moment before speaking yay woo she hesitantly asked since the moment I asked you for help until now why haven't you asked me if I have any grievances with Juku I myself am also restless and worried could it be that y woo you don't care about my situation at all are you simply wanting to repay your kind he looked straight ahead and replied actually I really want to know but I don't want to make you feel pressure I think that when you want to speak you will naturally do so hearing these words the young girl's heart was moved V woo you truly are a very special person both violent and gentle yiu looked her directly in the eyes his gaze full of determination my violence and gentleness are all reserved for those who deserve it Sulu was taken a back by his words she clenched her hands tightly her voice trembling then I have nothing to hide from you anymore actually I sudu began recounter past I was not born from a mother's wom but rather from a laboratory the one who devised this plan and carried it out is Juku a person from the eastern district yiu was taken aback upon hearing this shunu continued Juku has exploited ancient Gene editing technology to create a large number of infants I am just one of them she continued the newborns will be raised in the laboratory until they turn three after that Juku will quietly transfer them to Wild concentration camps or other safe areas to fend for themselves of course Juku is merely a tool the real Mastermind behind this plan is the leader of the Eastern region on the surface they claim this is to strengthen the population which has severely declined due to the apocalyptic era but in reality the true purpose is darker and more Ruth ruthless nevertheless I have not yet uncovered the whole truth behind it Sulu reminisced about her childhood back then I had to wheel of stick to fight for my life I have no memories before the age of three but everything that happened afterward I remember very clearly my memories began in the wild concentration camp in the southwest perhaps thanks to my Superior genes I was able to gradually fight on my own survive until now and attain the strength I have in the past I always thought I was just an orphan abandoned by my parents little did I know during a chance discovery of the dungeon I found out the truth about my Origins her face darkened seemingly trying to conceal her emotions she continued since that moment I made a resolution to become stronger I want to one day take revenge on Juku and the leader of the Easter region the one who stands behind him kulu's serious eyes were fixed on yiu she carefully reminded him among the people you see now I wonder how many are products of the secret plan of the east region looking at the girl before him Yi Wu fell into deep thought he silently pondered Sulu has really come a long way to reach this day yiu tightly grasped sulu's shoulder offering continuous encouragement Kulu thank you for sharing with me about your important past but what has happened is merely a push the future is what truly matters with your strength the future will surely be bright moreover you are mine your your goals are also my responsibility to help you achieve sulu's face turned red feeling shy yet still trying to retort you mine when did I become yours y Wu smiled nonchalantly responding of course as long as you join our team you are all mine sulu's face turned as red as a tomato stammering so so that's it whatever you say it's fine suddenly a demon Merchant appeared out of nowhere interrupted their conversation he grinned wickedly rubbing his hands together as he said I apologize for interrupting the sweet atmosphere between you to but the roaad is dangerous are you sure you don't want to purchase some weapons or premium items to Take Along yiu was startled turning to look behind him and murmuring demon Merchant Hulu was unfazed directly brandishing her sword and charging forward she shouted you evil fiend do you dare to take advantage of the chaos go die nephy immediately curled up trying to present a weak and fragile appearance then complained wait why are you attacking right away help there's a beautiful girl who wants to eat the goods of a poor Merchant killing and robbing is that it instantly Yu spoke up to stop her wait Sulu stop right now she managed to Halt just as the blade of her sword was mere inches from neph yiu observed for a moment then spoke sternly this guy is not as as simple as he seems don't act rashly he continued his gaze sharp even when faced with your swords Aura he's just pretending this is clearly an act the demon Merchant neph immediately retorted me I'm not pretending we acting this is just my inherent personality you're overthinking it sulu's face darkened she coldly said full of threat in this dangerous land of demons do you think I will believe the words of a demon neph right tell me your true identity if not I will kill you right now upon hearing this nephy immediately retracted his small fragile demeanor he excitedly introduced himself all right I am indeed a demon but I am also a legitimate Merchant my special mission is to help those who wander into this world deal with the young demons he said if you are a true man then spend some money to buy equipment from me after that rely on your own abilities to overcome the challenge do not overly depend on the strength of women sulu's expression turned cold responding icily ye woo this guy only knows how to spout nonsense we don't need to waste words with him let me kill him right away to avoid causing trouble that would ruin the plan she turned to speak sternly you need to investigate more carefully his words are contradictory aren't they as a demon he is helping others Challenge and kill demons how can I trust that napy hesitated for a moment then spoke out resolutely how am I supposed to know from the very beginning I was assigned this task without caring why if you really want to know then go ask the one who created me but I don't even know if that person really exists nafy snapped his fingers interrupting all right all right that's enough dialogue next let's move on to the main topic immediately a large menu appeared in front of all three suu exclaimed in Surprise oh there are so many weapons and items like this even Divine level equipment could it be that this guy is truly a merchant he confirmed of course but quickly displayed an extreme self-indulgent demeanor he looked at Tulu and said but don't let that make you fall in love with me though you are very beautiful I am a super professional seller women will only affect my sales volume meeting me is a stroke of luck for you after all I am a rarely appearing demon Merchant not showing up regularly and only at random locations yiu upon hearing this was taken aback and then criticized where did you learn this s style your attribute of excessive talking is too heavy then he hurriedly said wait this merchandise of yours is not right in front of him was a seductive Beauty on display she was accompanied by a product called demon whip which had the ability to summon evil he explained you can use her to seduce your enemies or you use her to Serve Yourself this is the Top Choice in travel tools do whatever you want sell in price 50 million Yu was stunned seemingly about to explode he looked at nafy with a judging gaze and said you claimed to be a merchant but in reality you are just a dishonest swindler nafy hurriedly explained look at what you are saying you know demons are incarnations of desire and depravity my responsibility being a demon Merchant is of course to satisfy these desires nephy smirked his expression clearly reflecting the demeanor of a petty Merchant engaging in underhanded dealings he continuously gestured pointing to each item and asking are you tempted want to buy haha Yu did not respond he quietly observed his surroundings appearing somewhat flustered then asked well you make a point I can't refute it right now but is there something a bit more respectable an item useful for combat and enhancing strength right after his words the items before him suddenly changed a new item appeared causing ye woo to involuntarily exclaim wait is this proof of immortality this item was of divine grade containing the memories of a depraved individual who had sold their soul to Demons it was the proof of immortality imbued with the power to escape the shackles of life and death moreover it was an indispensable material for crafting div Vine level Resurrection potions with a staggering price tag of 5 billion yiu was stunned he fell into deep thought I never expected that this demon Merchant would have such Divine grade materials a series of thoughts spun in his mind I already have the fruit of life and the crown of Destruction if I add the proof of immortality the only material left to craft the resurrection potion is supreme breath he bit his lip struggling internally this item is truly essential but but its absorb in price is beyond my means he looked at Tulu and spoke Tulu can you lend me some money again I need to buy this material Sulu opened the selection menu and shouted in panic 5 million it's not that I don't want to help you but even if I gave all my fortune I wouldn't have that much moreover what kind of item is it that costs so much y woo stroked his chin continuing to ponder he thought to himself while I could think of ways to borrow from others in the dungeon that ruthless demon definitely won't wait for me rare Merchants like him are hard to come by and if I miss this chance the likelihood of meeting him again is nearly zero he turned to the demon Merchant deciding to negotiate neph I want an item from you but I really don't have that much money can we do a trade instead I can exchange anything on me that you find suitable nephie hearing this showed an annoyed expression and replied what no money you dare to speak with with no money he grinned cunningly his body adopting a bizarre posture as he mocked young man I'm just a small businessman and can't offer credit and you want to trade you think you have something valuable I'm a businessman knowledgeable and well-informed there's absolutely nothing on you that I would want you are not satisfied and interrupt don't speak so confidently just try and see before you say anything immediately a red stone appears the demon exclaims in Surprise this this is oh my God I'm not seeing things am I you possess the demon blood Jade the demon cannot help but be astonished who is this person after watching NEPA coughs lightly and then speaks well there really isn't anything I want from you but if you show such sincerity and want to buy something then the professional ethics of a businessman like me won't allow me to disappoint a customer let me put it this way I will reluctantly accept this piece of demon blood Jade from you as a the trade however Yi Wu immediately changes his mind he turns off the image of the Jade smiles and says sorry this is the one thing I cannot trade forget it it seems this deal won't go through nephy is taken a what he quickly runs after you and pulls you back wait if the transaction doesn't go through there is still Humanity don't go just yet I mainly find you quite to my liking in business we can still negotiate Yu secretly observes him feeling delighted so he finally took the bait it seems the demon blood Jade is indeed extremely important to demon-like beings the way I deliberately showcased it to him truly worked he quickly stopped and said I really want to get that Divine gr material from you but I have no money what should I do the demon Merchant was also deep in thought contemplating what to do what else can be done this kid definitely has a big background he cannot be allowed to leave easily but I also can't just give this precious item to him for free while the three of them were immersed in their own calculations suddenly an elite demon appeared out of nowhere it shouted NEPA I've been looking for you for a long time you filthy creature you go all over selling goods and killing your fellow demons today I am going to tear you apart before the group could react a loud explosion occurred after that everything returned to the quiet as before but mixed in with that were faint sounds of Moaning the elite demon named Dak boy was easily sliced into pieces by him and sesd duu this seene terrified nephie causing him to step back he thought to himself these two are so strong that they handled that Elite demon chasing me in just two moves suddenly neph had a flash of inspiration he sincerely looked at him and said you can also use Devil's Spirit to exchange for the Divine grade material from me because now you already have 8,000 899 of them yeu suddenly felt anxious wondering how did he know how many evil spirits have killed he then voiced his question how many devil Spirits do I need to exchange with you nephie smiled and replied not many only 100,000 will do this statement made ye wo hesitate the number of devil Spirits neph mentioned coincides with my mission Target he couldn't help but doubt who is this demon Merchant why does he understand my situation so well although hew's gaze was fixed on nephie deep down he was still communicating with the system if I proceed with this transaction with the demon Merchant will it affect my mission immediately he received a response from the system feeling more at ease ye wo compromised all right I agree to this transaction but after it's done how can I find you after all you are a very rare Merchant nephy took a few steps forward spreading his hand to reveal a sparkling red stone he said take this Stone it will allow you to summon me at any time without being restricted by time you who looked at the stone feeling a bit suspicious nephy added however the number of uses is limited to three I have never allowed anyone to use it so you must be careful the personal notification rang in Yu's mind you have obtained the demon Bell with three uses available immediately afterwards neph the demon Merchant also vanished Into Thin Air before leaving he did not forget to add in the end I give you one more piece of information for free if you continue to head in this direction you will encounter a powerful demon who holds one of the 10 sins lust this is a demon that is incredibly difficult to deal with you should stay alert Yu stared blankly lust he was shocked and wondered why is it lust why is that going along with susulu could it be something is going to happen seeing ywo suddenly looks strange Sulu asked is something wrong Yu shook his head trying to act normal it's nothing let's move on sweat dripped down his face in his mind he secretly thought lust that sounds ominous I always have a bad feeling about this but having come this far no matter what lies ahead I cannot Retreat after the two had walked a distance a shadow suddenly appeared from behind it was muzi a member of the Phoenix team she carefully observed the two thinking to herself these two are indeed not simple they easily dealt with an elite demon thankfully my high Lev stealth ability is skillful enough without the scouting tools they definitely wouldn't discover me muzi immediately reported to shuen Captain Yi Wu and the others are continuing towards the boss but there is something I must report to you Yi Wu just encountered a mysterious person who claims to be a demon Merchant they managed to obtain a pile of strange items including the demon Bell from this person shuen nodded and instructed muzi to continue monitoring Yu's group but reminded him carefully be mindful of the distance do not let them notice wait until they are exhausted from fighting the boss and then immediately execute the assassination plan muzi solemly accepted the order shuen pondered V woo I do not underestimate you nor do I overestimate you as long as I remain Vigilant the opportunity to kill you and sees the ancient god and the demon Merchants Bell will arrive everything seems to be under my control after eliminating all the demons Shu wen's subordinates came to report Captain the demons on our side have been cleared shuen nodded in satisfaction move a little further the boss demon must be deep inside he then instructed his subordinates to take a break and contacted other teams himself he opened the dungeon information to check the battle situation of the groups in the southern part of the dungeon the queen team was preparing for the boss battle Fay Yen proudly spoke through the communication Channel we have cleared the elite boss before the fight once we adjust a bit we can continue to fight the main boss you guys must not be slower than us right in the north of the dungeon of the mercenary group Lisha Shen was fighting he said on our side as well we can initiate the boss fight at anytime hearing this his subordinate shouted but boss we haven't killed the elite monster yet before the boss fight shaan immediately yelled damn it if you don't know how to speak shut up are we about to win on Yu's side he calmly explained we'd have been delayed on our side due to special circumstances right now we are preparing to fight the elite monster before the boss fight upon hearing this shaen angrily shouted what you haven't started fighting the elite monster yet and there are special circumstances suddenly unable to proceed in dragging us into it do you dare to make excuses can you do it it were not Fen sneered mocking yo you are handsome but useless then you have truly let down her expectations of you sui standing beside them thought to himself Yu wouldn't drag everyone down like this there must really be something causing his delay suddenly ju's face darkened feeling angry no way why should I worry about that guy he is now living in a sweet happy world for two sh men scoffed when he heard Yu say that he said wwo it's fine if you don't have the strength but from the very beginning when we split up to act you didn't put in any effort at all now because of your vanity the entire team is dragged down the difficulty of fighting the boss has increased how do you plan to make up for it Juku standing behind chimed in all right the delay caused by that kid was expected there's no need to blame him too much the most important thing now is is to prepare for the next boss battle after saying that Juku thought to himself he it seems like this kid Yu is about to reach his limit but that's fine just when I need him to be material for body enhancement hearing Juku words Sulu was Furious a cat crying over a mouse's death is fake compassion he definitely has no good intentions and none of the others are any better y Wu gently told aulu just ignore them we only need to focus on the task at hand a moment later two demons appeared one was a Black Succubus and the other was a white succubus one of them spoke with great excitement looks sister two new little pets have come right to us the other nodded clearly thrilled yes and their bodies look so young and full of life this scent so sweet I can hardly resist eulu immediately reminded ywu don't act otherwise they will control you after saying that she quickly stepped forward and actively attacked the Black Succubus sneered arrogantly not only men but even women will be controlled by us truly a pet that doesn't know its place my master hasn't even spoken yet and you have already charged in on your own so we must punish you until you can't get up again as soon as she finished speaking the Black Succubus swung her whip aiming directly at susulu however Sulu remained undaunted she immediately used will of ice to block the attack this is a special type of magic that when cast on the body increases resistance and simultaneously protects one's will this skill allows her to be immune to mental control effects especially from entities of a lower level the Black Succubus widened her eyes in Surprise what is this how can you be immune to my enchantment the white succubus standing beside her angrily shouted stupid pet dare to resist your Master's teachings then let us awaken the debauchery deep within Soul after saying that bulk suu simultaneously attacked xulu the sound of the wits cracking echoed causing the space to seem to pause for a moment one of the suu snarled you truly have no awareness of being food for this rudess you must be taught a very harsh lesson Yu saw the TU Su Cube attacking susulu fiercely and became worried that she was being overwhelmed he quickly ran in to help her Sulu immediately smiled and turned to say Lee Woo didn't I tell you don't intervene in previous battles you were always the first to charge in for me I haven't even warmed up yet this time is different I finally consider myself warmed up next let me finish this battle the two sukai laughed mockingly upon hearing this hey girl this human pet is really trying to be funny to say such things haha sister I think this poor pet is trying to attract our attention how foolish she doesn't even know how to win her master's favor suu Furious immediately used her magic Crystal to summon the goddess of ice and snow she shouted do you think so let me show you whether I am just boasting having said that she unleashed the Eternal Eastern ice Calamity continuously attacking the two succubi at that moment both were left with only 10% Health succubus black exclaimed in pain oh girl this human woman is no simple matter we underestimated her clearly we are no match for her now the white succubus suddenly came up with a plan she shouted loudly and charged towards Yoo sister I have a way let's follow me if that woman is too strong and we can't fight her then let's attack the man standing next to her we can control him to change the situation as soon as the white succubus finished her words she was unexpectedly sliced in half by Kulu she screamed tragically what we are defeating Again by a human woman I'm not reconciled Yu witnessed the scene and immediately approached saying Tulu you were much stronger than before you took down two Elite ones at 190 level by yourself if you killed Juku I believe you can handle it alone before Yu could finish his sentence Sulu Suddenly lunged at him and kissed him he widened his eyes in complete surprise what is this yiu jumped in shock wondering why Gulu did that suddenly he realized this was not an ordinary kiss he tried to push hu away but his arms were completely powerless a thought flashed through his mind succubus suddenly from behind guwu a succubus appeared mocking him you are immersed in this endless lust are you excited are you enjoying it she leaned close to Yu's ear and whispered but you are not yet fully immersed you should immerse yourself even more otherwise you will waste my you know she continued the two suck you by earlier were merely bait for me designed to stir your passions so that you could continuously absorb the information elements I disseminate in the air having said that she giggled this woman has absorbed a large amount of information elements and now she is performing very well just as I expected but you did not participate in the battle this has surprised me a bit her face immediately darkened so that is why you can maintain your r ity it seems the absorption of information elements is indeed not enough as soon as she finished peing Yu gripped sulu's hand tightly and pushed her away she smiled still struggling are you your strength truly exceeds my expectations then she snapped her fingers and said loudly then let's make this atmosphere of L even more intense this is indeed a pleasant surprise after saying that she looked at mu his invisibility spell had lost its effect and he stood at a distance watching secretly apparently very interested in you all it's a pity you won't join in sir High pointed at her and exclaimed joyfully now you have absorbed enough Elemental information go ahead and liberate yourself Yu was very surprised when he saw mood's ey you have the Phoenix team when has she been monitoring us damn it I was careless but whole way I didn't notice her at that moment M could no longer control her body and she felt a rush of warm all over she took off her coat and gave a silly smile mu looked at Yu thinking to herself why does this man who is clearly my assassination Target make my heart race like this then she ran over and hugged Yu tightly sir High laughed joyfully haha from kissing to hugging can you handle it this is my favorite scene stop suppressing yourself except your truest self let go she immediately went to Yu's side tempting him stop resisting in vain I am the embodiment of lust I literate desires I embrace desires it brings me joy and satisfies you as well Yu began to worry I've faced many things but I've never encountered anything like today the ominous premonition I had earlier has come true y Wu had a headache thinking could it be that I have to use tricks to deal with the president of the Breaking Bad Club suddenly yiu came up with an idea at this moment CI began to emit a kind of of seductive pollen she laughed triumphantly you can still hold on like that it seems I can only use my ultimate move this is the poll of desire it can stimulate extreme lust leading you to ecstasy once you fall into the deepest place of the world of lust no one can resist this temptation after saying that she spread the pollen around y wo suddenly a dazzling light burst forth from yiu shining straight at survey she narrowed her eyes and shouted angrily you still resist she hesitated her eyes revealing a hint of panic this light Could It Be At This Moment Sur realized that it was indeed the demon blood Jade she continuously asked why do you have the demon blood Jade how did you obtain such an important thing taking advantage of Cy's confusion yiu Broke Free from her control he carefully helped Zulu and muzy up and coldly said what I hate most is the temptation of lust and human life you are indeed very good at exploiting human weaknesses but it seems that I have inadvertently grafted your weaknesses as demons too ye W smiled provocatively want the demon blood Jade then drop those dirty tricks of yours and come to rob it in Brun daylight Siri upon hearing this became wildly excited I knew it I knew you weren't an ordinary person you truly haven't disappointed me you have brought me a great surprise she said lightly before I was always stimulating the lust of others but this time I can clearly feel the intense desire within me being stimulated by you haha this feeling is wonderful unparalleled saying that she immediately transformed into a giant snake system notification the host has switched accounts with that man Yi Wu smiled it seems that your mutated body has captivated quite a few people to challenge you then he immediately transformed if you've revealed your bloodline then I will suppress all desires and unleash everything onto you y Wu Unleashed countless attacks charging straight towards lust lust used a targeting lock and fired downwards below Yu Was preparing the gun aiming directly at her ywu looked directly into lust his voice deep but full of challenge isn't it true that you want to vent with me is your desire just this if that's the case unleash all your Firepower and attack me wildly lus became Furious her eyes flashing with Danger but before she could react Yu had delivered a direct blow Boom the strike sent lust staggering and she unexpectedly exclaimed what what are you doing yiu smiled coldly don't rush you want fire power right I have plenty of that he immediately controlled a fleet of drones hundreds of them soaring towards lust laser beams from the drones rain down creating a storm of Firepower lust was caught in the hail of bullets screaming and pain y Wu chuckled lightly emphasizing each word want more I have plenty of ways to satisfy you but remember to be patient after saying that he raised his gun aimed straight at her and fired in Rapid succession overwhelmed lus panicked and shouted wait just wait a moment however the laser beams from the drones kept firing boom a massive explosion shook the entire space lust fell to her knees her body trembled in agony she weakly screamed her voice filled with panic Yu paused looking down at her from above his cold voice rang out so how is it can't handle it yet truly not worth it sexual desire heard Yu say this and sneered replying only you are attacking unilaterally it's a bit boring if I don't take the initiative to cooperate how can I enjoy it as she spoke she thought to herself this kind of intense attack really makes it hard for me to bear but the more it is like this the more excited I become I can sense the depraved desire hidden deep within your soul out of control and full of killing intent only I can satisfy you only I am worthy of you around her countless Souls were resisting wanting to escape from the body of sexual desire the horrifying scene was evident as people collapsed before her lust monsters with Crimson skin and horns on their heads began to charge forward they Beed their fangs extended their Claws and slowly approached y Wu sexual desire laughed loudly they are extremely excited at the Target that is you let me lead you to the Bliss of Desire the screams rang out and a horde of monsters simultaneously soared into the air and charged straight at Yu without hesitation watching the chaotic scene before him yiu smirked he calmly said I was worried I wouldn't have enough demons to kill now that you brought so many materials like this I really have to thank you saying that two yellow saw blades appeared in Yu's hands with a powerful swing he severed the bodies of two evil demons with a determined gaze y Wu continued to charge forward witnessing this scene the lust grew panicked and exclaimed this guy is completely immersed in the pleasure of Slaughter entirely suppressing the desires within one of the demons that y woa eliminated became fearful unable to believe what was happening he shouted what on Earth are you is this really the strength of humanity yiu did not respond his cold eyes continued to sweep away everything in his path with one attack two demons fell to the ground he chuckled lightly savoring the sense of satisfaction though lust was frightened she could not hide her excitement speaking up a monster H that's quite an interesting joke you are even more of a demon than we are Yu replied in a challenging tone a is that all there is I'm still not satisfied he stood at top the corpses of the monsters leaning against his weapon looking down at the opponent with contempt seeing this scene lus became even more thrilled you are indeed a strong man your entire body radiates the desire for violence you are no different from a demon perhaps even more so she laughed hardly her voice full of Allure if the thrill of fighting brings you Joy then just keep going in her hand she held the Loft the head of a demon raising it high the demon Army moaned at her feet from their mouths a thick Red Mist was spreading Yu stood alone strong and dignified he immediately unleashed the technique spells flying everywhere she laughed loudly her voice sharp echoing haha how can ordinary tricks elevate my fighting Power to its peak as the embodiment of lust I will certainly use a weapon filled with eroticism to conquer you saying this a strange sword appeared in her hand a lust sword entirely red it tip shining brightly she raised the sword pointing it straight at guu instantly her body began to transform this was the queen of lust her second form her figure grew larger her eyes filled with pride looking down at guwu she smirked and said this sword carries the attribute of spiritual paralysis it will make you experience combat in a state of euphoric numbness reaching the Pinnacle of pleasure as soon as she finished speaking she charged straight at him the tip of the sword aimed directly at Yu with extreme speed the system's warning blared in Yu's mind detected host is being spiritually controlled by the lust sword control level reached 20% please host immediately escaped the current area yiwu gritted his teeth retreating to create distance he thought to himself damn spiritual control my artifacts cannot resist this level of control desire shouted while thinking where do you want to go the sword in her hand emitted a dazzling source of energy yiu quickly dodged that attack desire extended her wings and flew straight towards him dust and smoke swirling everywhere the sound of rumbling echoed continuously she angrily said if you want to reach the peak of battle there can be no distance between us suddenly Yu's Wings emitted a powerful golden light charging straight at desire she was hit and immediately showed a look of discomfort yiu coldly retorted you don't want me to get close have you suddenly become shy desire smiled her voice full of confidence facing my second form suppressing desire is useless because unlike other desires lust is the Primal Instinct of living beings the more you suppress it the stronger I become unexpectedly she escaped from the previous attack and immediately charged Trey at Yu he was astonished unable to believe what was happening in his heart he thought from this incredible recovery and obsession obession she clearly isn't lying is this really her inherent power desire moved closer her voice booming lust is the Instinct that prolongs the life of all things the source of reproduction no creature can stop this unless that person dies she wielded her sword and thrust it straight at ywu blood gushed from the wound incessantly the system emitted a warning detected host under mental control control level is rising pleas host immediately increased the distance from the boss she moved closer to yiu reaching out to touch his face smiling as she said I know you are very unwilling but facing me a being only inferior to the strongest of the seven evil Kings it's not unjust for you to lose don't worry you were not dead yet the system continuously blared warnings contamination level of the host has reached 80% please host leave the current area immediately Yi Wu remains silent not uttering a word seeing this she leaned in closer a smug smile clearly visible on her face she whispered teasingly because you were the man I have my eye on before I enjoy the pleasure how could I let you die like this the alarm persisted mental control level has reached 90% The Host body and mind are nearing their endurance limits please leave the area immediately all around countless spells surrounded the sword piercing through Yu's body blood from the wound flowed along the blade staining the ground the seductive voice had a somewhat enchanting quality she leaned closer to Y wo and continued excitement looking at your current state is truly unbearable stop struggling give up your last resistance I can make you happy you satisfy me this is quite Fair isn't it as long as you hand over the devil blood Jade I will let you become my king to die with me hearing her words made Yu somewhat angry he shouted don't think you can SED ex me I only have one word for demons kill saying that he tightly gripped the sword lying in front of him with a 96% control over his Spirit seeing him say this the seductor continued to plunge the sword deeper into him saying no no no you not good like this be quiet stop struggling you are only forcing me to kill you to seize the blood Jade I truly don't want to do this among the seven greats my Marshall power isn't the strongest but I can become the second strongness do you know why simply because of lust this Primal Instinct cannot be suppressed or erased with that she relentlessly thrust the sword deeper into her opponent Yu was in so much pain that he could not speak but humans can never completely conquer their inherent instincts this is something that has been predetermined it doesn't matter whether that person is still alive or has died everything becomes meaningless she said coldly her hands tightly gripping his throat lifting him high the system continuously warned mental control level has reached 99% I once gave you a chance but you didn't know how to cherish it you were once a rare material but now farewell she continued from now on you no longer need to suppress your Humanity Humanity I have never had that my planet was once invaded by demons beings everywhere fell into despair after countless years I exterminated all of them consuming the planet entirely but the more demon I killed the deeper I fell into the Lust For Slaughter until I was ultimately countered by it that is the fate of the evil reader in the end they become evil themselves but I refuse to accept this outcome and what about you y Wu spoke up breaking the silence at this moment the panoramic image appeared and he responded how do I see of course I use my eyes but I still have to congratulate you finally you have reached the final step MOSI emphasized Ed the energy core of the interdimensional communication device I gave you is almost depleted it's a Pity that I cannot witness you saving your planet or destroying it hearing those words he sighed and said this planet apart from the remaining demons is left with only to me there are no other lives that can be saved so risking my life like this does it have any meaning ye woo feeling sorrowful reached out to touch the mask hearing this mosai seemed somewhat pleased putting his hand behind him and saying things like meaning are merely excuses to paralyze oneself everything we have done until now is simply to satisfy the desires within us right as long as we understand our own desires everything else is worth less than a scent yiu replied this answer really aligns with your usual rebellious style most high would answer the same way you know it clearly too don't you the reason I have persisted until now is not entirely because of the right in my heart in fact persisting for righteousness to put it plainly is just another way to satisfy the desires Within Me righteousness and evil in the end are merely different manifestations of inner desires what you need to do now is to forsake those weak vague thoughts and move forward don't pretend to be Humane with that feeble smile anymore accept the change and understand your own inner self more deeply it really is as simple as that upon hearing this ye wo bir bur into laughter haha you truly are a Madman MOSI your words really make me more clear-headed at that moment the system suddenly emitted a warning sound power is about to be depleted the full projection will shut down in 3 seconds before Vanishing MOSI chuckled lightly and added If You Can Think Clearly then my efforts have not been in vain go complete your mission farewell ye W leaned against the wall beside him his eyes filled with sadness as he murmured I have always cared too much about what is called Justice and meaning only humans Ponder things that cause themselves pain in the end none of it holds any significance for me because I am not human as he finished speaking he removed the armored mask from his head revealing a face with Crimson eyes years of hiding behind the mask to conceal his identity had also clouded his own inself yiu moved closer to the ultimate boss who was growling with rage it bared teeth mouth a Gabe its fiery gaze fixed below violent lightning surrounded the area standing before the boss ywu tightened his grip on his weapon his gaze sharp as steel he declared as a demon binding myself with the weaknesses of humanity is truly laughable I am merely a demon who Delights in Justice and desire there should be no more ambiguity within myself now I will heed my inner self unleashing my Fury and the instinct to kill ye would emanated a Fierce killing intent the lightning around him rumbling incessantly he growled my name is the Destroyer if I am a demon I'm must inherit the legacy of this world ensuring no demon surpasses me without delay he raised his gun aiming Straight Ahead a shock wave erupted from Yu blasting the enemy's body away she panicked and shouted what suddenly happened wasn't he supposed to be in a thrashing State before death why is he exuding such a strong Aura moreover this Aura is like that of a demon of the same kind at that moment Yu had pulled the pure desire sword out of his body blood kept pouring out and he painfully exclaimed ah the system announced due to the host life being in danger the protective mechanism has been activated the account of the demon Destroyer will be temporarily activated youu suddenly transformed into the demon Destroyer the system continued however since the mission to kill 10,000 demons has not yet been completed Ed the demon Destroyer State can only be maintained for 5 minutes the cool down time is 2 hours seeing the situation before her lust was in disbelief exclaiming what is happening the desire he is displaying is only one of anger and Slaughter my lust cannot influence him at all this level is close to the strongest among the 10 deadly sins no it might even have surpassed it the pure desire sword in her hand kept screaming H it's too hot too hot we're about to be burned to death by his rage Yu was Furious immediately charging towards the seductive creature and shouting demon of lust I must kill you the succubus realizing the danger before her fearfully exclaimed wait I didn't expect you to be one of my kind I was rude and disrespectful before please don't do this without letting her finish yiu swung his sword to attack she swiftly dodged and then turned to flee his eyes never left her filled with murderous intent want to run a demon that escapes my sight will never exist he shouted a powerful word die with that Yu swung his weapon delivering a slash towards his opponent the pink-haired succubus reveal a bewitching charm she pleaded please don't kill me although I can't die if I get seriously injured it will take a long time to regenerate this body it took hundreds of years to condense this perfect form if it gets destroyed like this this it would be truly a shame let me serve you my king I don't want to miss the chance with you if it's you I'm willing to submit and do anything for you she lay on the ground her gaze alluring her voice inviting she immediately rushed to hug Yu's leg the strength of Y Wu radiated alongside an alluring aura that captivated her she said right now I genuinely want to serve you y Wu stared at the scene momentarily freezing before coldly saying do you think I will believe such nonsense I Vis quickly intervened wait Master she is not lying you we seem slightly irritated if that's the case then why is my mosta account in such disarray I've this explained because your current account is deeply linked to the mosty account when the true state of the linked account is unlocked I can also be utilized she continued to add the emotional spectrum of this female demonus is very complex including fear excitement lust Obsession and Distortion all are clearly displayed but there are no signs of Deceit or conspiracy you Wu contemplative is there a possibility that she is hiding those emotions I Vis shook her head resolutely stating no master this kind of lustful demonis cannot hide her true emotions and desires ye W turn to the succubus and said now I give you a chance whether you live or die will depend on what benefits you can bring me if the answer does not satisfy me then I will strike you back to your original form hearing this the succubus smiled brightly my king the greatest benefit is of course bringing you Pleasures beyond your imagination my ability to manipulate lust is the strongest I can control anyone through it even those immune to magic or mental artifacts cannot resist the more she spoke the more excited she became with me as long as you are willing we can transcend levels and races I can make any Target sink into an inescapable desire as long as it is a being with lust none can escape the sucubus slowly moved closer to Y wo lowering her voice of course you are the exception my king the killings over countless bloody years have Stripped Away all desire from you leaving only rage Yi Wu observed every move of the succubus intently silently assessing controlling the Mind regardless of race or level indeed a very useful skill its Effectiveness surpasses even my own Poison Control later when I go to the Eastern Area to face those of higher ranks this skill will surely be useful ywu finally made a decision all right I greed to your request the sucubus was so Overjoyed that she couldn't help but kiss ywu with excitement I'm so happy my king yiwu was completely taken back the succubus explained the demon contract has officially been completed when whenever you need to summon me just call and I will come system notification the host has signed a contract with the sucubus the succubus has been stored in the system space this is a support type demon her skills can bypass level and race limitations but using them requires a price when facing enemies with a minor level difference the cost is a kiss however if encountering opponents with a significant level Gap the host must satisfy her deeper desires yiu was a astonished to the point of reverting to his original form what I Vis standing beside him grinned mischievously those deeper desires Master you might find it hard to hold back yigu side it seems that desire is indeed a double-edged sword on the other side suu gradually woke up how could I have fallen asleep what happened I remember killing Tu suu then I can't recall anything else y Wu recalled the scene from earlier and laughed awkwardly don't worry it's fine now we absolutely cannot let Sulu Know About Us kissing Sulu stood up stretching comfortably she happily said I don't know why but I suddenly feel so light the fatigue I've felt before has completely vanished now I feel full of energy Yu forced a smile no need for that the boss has been dealt with by me Sulu was shocked what Yu could only look at her helplessly sulu's expressions are really diverse he thought to himself is this really her true face suddenly a short-haired girl slowly woke up she looked around astonished why are my clothes so disheveled clearly I was following the captain's orders to keep an eye on him the girl glanced at Yu realizing the current situation and thought angrily he must have done something to me then she grabbed her sword and charged at y Wu shouting you are a rogue a beast I must kill you the girl's body trembled uncontrollably she panicked what is happening why isn't my body listening to me all of a sudden Yu also knew exactly what was happening there remains a bit of lustful energy in her body from before now that lust has submitted to me she naturally cannot attack me yiu spoke up cutting through my train of thought you really are a wicked one to accuse first it's clear that you've been secretly watching me before now that your actions have been exposed I might not kill you but the price you have to pay is to return to the Phoenix team and act as a spy for me the girl protested vehemently be a spy for you haven't you underestimated me although I don't know what method you've used to control my body you cannot control my spirit the blade in her hand suddenly turned back aimed straight at herself her voice was filled with determination rather than betray I would rather end my own life even in death I will not betray Captain wo W shu the girl tried to hold the blade tightly in her hand but it seemed that invisible force was preventing her she was confused and in pain why can't I even end my own life what on Earth have you done to me Yu stepped closer his gaze calm but chilling you're so loyal I can rest easy now don't worry I won't make things difficult for you you don't need to do anything harmful to the Phoenix team I just need you to return to recount what you see what you hear back to me the girl was still resisting fiercely absolutely impossible don't even think about it y Wu immediately use seduction to gain control muzi instantly submitted yes from now on I am yours for you I am willing to do anything what's wrong with me her heart was racing wildly if it's this man then deep down I can't refuse could this be the feeling of Love suddenly several notifications from others came through all team teams report on the battle situation with the boss the queen team is in a tough fight and needs support we're in the same situation this boss is much stronger than the previous one we can hardly hold on any longer hurry to help us y wo immediately reported the situation the boss fight on my side has ended everyone was surprised what did you say suddenly a boy spoke up V woo why didn't you follow the plan we agreed upon before what kind of hero act are you pulling your Reckless Behavior disregarding the larger picture will endanger everyone the bald old man continued I knew that brat would ruined things sure enough it was a mistake to use him as test material from the start but if that kid really could take down the boss alone then it shows he has value you will become my test subject The Man in The Mask then spoke up oh my no wonder my boss suddenly became so difficult to defeat so it was all you're doing you intentionally sabot AG the plan to kill the boss so that the other bosses could increase their attributes to take revenge on us the battle was still incredibly chaotic in front of the Arrogant monster Brett one of the team members suddenly reported Captain it seems like the boss's attributes haven't increased at all another one fighting against the lazy monster slot updated the situation that's right the attributes of my boss haven't increase either you guys simply can't handle a boss and can't blame it on a little handsome guy another fighter yelled out oh my the boss's attributes really haven't increased but wait if they haven't increased why are we still struggling in this hard fight hearing this the captain's face immediately turned proud he looked at Yu and coldly said vwoo if you don't have the skills don't be so arrogant didn't you say you killed the boss but the boss's attributes haven't increased at all how do you explain that the man in the Mast didn't miss the chance to question what what else could it be he's definitely just good at boasting clearly unable to do it but still wanting to scare us truly a kiddo who doesn't know how to do anything ye woo I only said that the boss battle with me has ended I never said that I killed boss the attributes of the other bosses haven't increased because I've captured the boss the captain's face turned Grim vwo it's fine if you want to be a useless teammate but don't think that our intelligence matches yours if the boss could be captured then why why do we have to struggle so hard in battle the old Professor added haven't you realized yet these bosses not only grow stronger but they also excel at exploiting human weaknesses that kid is so eager to show off his skills that he has definitely been targeted by the boss however I speculate that among these 10 crimes there's no evil spirit that would lie could it be that this kid was defeated by the little monster before he even reached a critical point in the fight the masked man immediately burst into a laughter makes sense I find this highly likely isn't he a teammate he shows no awareness at all if you're going to be a fool you might as well listen to the advice given clearly a useless person should live like a useless person dedicating themselves to strong men like us until death is enough yet he still wants to show off in front of us this guy is about to make me laugh to death dungeon announcement the lust boss has been subdued the one who subdued it is Yu he has unlocked the hidden B strategy with rewards and experience points received being doubled the attributes of the remaining bosses have decreased by 10% upon seeing such an announcement everyone immediately turned pale what is what he said true he actually subdued the boss is that even possible and there's this kind of operation the boss's attributes are reduced by 10% not only is what he said true but we also benefit from him on the other side teammates were still fighting although the attribut of the boss had decreased it should not be underestimated there are still plenty of dangers stop talking nonsense and quickly kill the boss this is a rare opportunity don't waste it the greedy evil grumbled in battle lust has been subdued what a Pity I was quite fond of her her Greed for lust was the only one that suited my taste among the 10 sins we possess the Arrogant PR standing beside him continuously mocked the saint is a Mighty Demon yet youi yelds to a mere human what a disgrace lust spoke with anoints this is truly a humiliation for our demons a weak person like her lacking in strength should have chosen to die to atone yet she dares to choose to betray us lazy slot continuously shook his head his tone revealing undeniable fatigue it's really hard because of lust betrayal our attributes have been reduced and we have to expend a lot of energy dealing with these humans I'm so sleep so tired after we deal with these rotten pests I must sleep for a month meanwhile the girl with green hair maintained her fighting stance as expected of Y wo you have indeed successfully subdued the boss one of the people nearby whispered if I can be like suu having Yu support by my side that would be great but immediately he blamed himself no I am truly too useless even at this point I am still thinking about relying on Yu suddenly yiu appeared supporting the body of the girl with green hair his sword moved as fast as Lightning slicing through the monsters Yu gently said I'm sorry I'm late y Wu moved closer to comforter regardless of your purpose for infiltrating the queen team to participate in this dungeon just go ahead and do it I am your strongest support suddenly her face flushed red she thought to herself could it be that yeu guessed what I wanted to do never mind those things aren't important the most important thing now is that I know Yu cares about me he hasn't abandoned me right after that Yu promptly moved to assist the queen team one member of the team exclaimed I can't believe you came to help us Yi Wu responded lightly no need to take it to heart the captain of the queen team watched the situation filled with doubt but could it be that he wants to steal our boss what should we do right now we need him for support but we don't want to just give up the boss at that moment yiu spoke up don't worry I have no intention of stealing your boss my only target is those small monsters Sulu let's go hearing this the captain of the queen team awkwardly thought this kit really isn't ordinary it's me who has a bad image revealing a narrow Vision Yu continue to fight relentlessly in her heart she reassured herself Not all men in this world are rotten there are true truly people who make me feel worthy of trust everyone is putting their full strength into defeating the lazy monsters slot thanks to you woo we can finally focus on dealing with the boss without having to spread our strength and energy on the small monsters with his help the boss battle has become much easier the soldiers continuously encourage each other one person exclaims hey everyone look at ye woo he's really strong another girl chimes in that's right before we had to fight each small small monster one by one exhausting so much energy and now he kills an entire swarm so easily he's so handsome a voice filled with admiration Echoes another girl humorously says boss I suddenly find myself interested in men the person next to her laughs haha I feel the same way meanwhile the captain of the queen team keeps charging forward to attack the monsters she shouts loudly you kids focus on attacking the boss don't let ye W support go to waste on the other side y Wu and suu are still fighting hard suu pays attention to every action of Yu secretly thinking this guy really has a deadly charm wherever he goes with the girls around him even that girl with blue ve earlier was drawn to him I should completely trust Yu however she hesitates a bit it might be a bit hard to bring it up but I must find an opportunity to tell yiu the real reason I joined the dungeon this time suddenly the captain of the queen team became smug Our Queen team has reduced the boss's Health to only 22% we can launch the final assault at any time she looked over with a confident expression the captain on this side was extremely surprised to hear that only 22% how is that possible even our boss's health is still much higher than that the masked man was also taken aback suspicious are you kidding how could you all reduce the boss's Health to only 22% look over here the boss still has 45% Health you women have started to learn from that kid guu deai haven't you the captain of the queen team remained calm UNF sorry we have you assisting us clearing out the little monsters so we can focus all our attacks on the boss her words immediately left everyone stunned what that kid y has gone to support the queen team a member of the team voiced their frustration boss this isn't fair on what basis does their team get assistance while we have to face both the boss and the little monsters on our own everyone was still struggling to fight against the monsters clearly there were still three teams engaged in the boss fight yet y Wu chose to help the queen team another person growled with the strength of our team if we had assistance the boss would have been taken down a long time ago wuen Shu was extremely angry at this moment shouting loudly what are you doing don't get distracted focus on fighting for me does our Phoenix team still need support from others damn it just one wrong step and now I've completely been suppressed by that kidy woo on the other side muzi turned back to report woo Wen Shu nervously asked muzi why have you returned didn't I tell you muzi immediately bowed her head her voice trembling I'm sorry Captain I failed my mission I was detected by Yu woo W shoes faced turned red with anger but he tried to suppress his rage what are you standing there for since you're back quickly join the team and boost the attack you useless piece of trash if it weren't for the fact that we're sure on people right now I would definitely kill you right gear woo Wen sho's complexion became increasingly Grim he gritted his teeth and pronounced each word distinctly V woo at first I just wanted to kill you to take what's on you but now I've changed my mind I absolutely won't let you die easily on the other side the captain of the queen team was trying to encourage the members ladies halt the attack just hold the boss back don't let its Health drop any further otherwise it will trigger the berserk State she said let's take a little break first then we'll simultaneously launched the final Annihilation attack on the boss along with the other two teams on the other side wuen Shu was trying his best he reported Captain the boss's Health has successfully been suppressed to only 21% the captain nodded responding with satisfaction well done pause the attack for now mercenary Squad how's the situation on your end the masked man feeling flustered spoke up why the rush the boss's health is still at 35% if you're so free why not send some people to assist us our team has too many stragglers and the coordination of formations is all chaotic we have to deal with the boss at the same time too such a situ situation makes it hard for the entire team to concentrate their Firepower to attack the boss some team members started to Grumble at each other one said before entering the dungeon didn't you say you wanted to take care of us how come it's like this already the queen team flatly rejected the request for assistance leaving a tense atmosphere between the teams woen Shu began to explain the combat missions of the squads have been divided since the very beginning I have no obligation to support you right now now you're just causing me more trouble the Phoenix team has also declined to assist anyone can say polite words but the reality is they refuse to provide assistance it's pointless for you to be angry the captain of The Mercenaries replied angrily fine not willing to provide support huh I'll turn on you all if we die we die together if my boss can't handle this don't think you'll survive either the attributes of the boss will increase and then it'll be too late for regrets The Mercenaries panicked boss what can we do now we're about to exhaust ourselves we can't hold on anymore if both the queen team and the Phoenix team won't help should we try asking ywo for assistance the captain immediately shouted get out no way I targeted him before how could he possibly help me now besides do you think I can lower my dignity like that stop talking nonsense if no one helps then take care of it yourself put all your strength into attacking for me the monster unexpectedly accelerated emitting a terrifying pressure that made everyone shiver some couldn't bear it any longer starting to scream we can't take it anymore let's run our lives are more important those who tried to flee were yelled back by the captain run running only means waiting to be killed by the boss if you want to fight then fight yourself I'm only here to make money from the dungeon not to die here the captain couldn't hold back at this moment and slammed his down on the ground I've roed wild for so many years why have I come to this point today could it really be that there's no way out is it truly coming to an end like this the monster continuously charged forward he thought to himself it's over it seems everything's coming to an end in my next life I must be friends with strong men my subordinates are no longer reliable nothing can be done about it the captain wept bitterly the boss can be so easily broken how am I supposed to lead the team in the future suddenly a sword blade obstructed him in front Yu finally arrived to be a boss one must have awareness one must lead by example sacrifice more endure more than anyone else one must never be complacent at any moment a group of others also returned it's Yi woo Yi wo has come to rescue us the captain was overjoyed clearly everything was about to end he had already given up unexpectedly at the last moment y wo brought hope back to him y wo both attacked and encouraged everyone don't just stand there everyone deal with the boss I will clean up the small monsters running around the mercenary Captain also shouted loudly guys charge with me this boss has suppressed us for too long now we must show our strength kill them all immediately the mercenary lunged forward Diane sincerely said no need to thank me I was wrong to Target you before after this is over I will make amends with you yiu was clearing the monsters while replying let's talk about that later on the other side Wu Wu was extremely Furious Li woo it's you again You're just showing off too much don't think I don't know what you're planning you're not worried about the dangers on the battlefield your main goal is to pull the two factions you established together I see through your intentions wuen Shu grew more enraged as he spoke no matter what you do it's useless I still have my ultimate move to use just wait then wo when Shu immediately ordered everyone exert all your strength to attack we must eliminate the boss in the shortest time possible let's see how long you could be pleased with yourself ye woo as long as I use my ultimate move the ancient god and the evil Bel on you will ultimately belong to me the group of monsters is still using all their strength woo when Shu reminds It's the final moment give it your all we absolutely cannot lose to the other teams anymore we must protect the honor of the Phoenix team yes captain on the side of the queen team the members are also doing their utmost one person shouts loudly sisters don't stop attacking Yu's help has made it easy for us to suppress the boss's Health next we must secure the first kill on the boss we also need to prove to Yu that he has not made a mistake in helping our team over here yiu moves skillfully effortlessly taking down each monster when the group of monsters gathers in one spot with just one shot yiu wipes out the entire group the nearby mercenaries are stunned wow his Monster pulling skills are so clever every time he strikes he takes out a whole pack so he used to help the queen team take down monsters like this so cool with yiwu's assistance the battle against the boss becomes much simpler one team member excitedly says finally we can feel the joy that the queen team experienced the atmosphere becomes increasingly Lively one person reminds everyone concentrate Firepower aim precisely at the boss and attack we cannot waste Yu's effort a massive explosion occurred engulfing the entire space in Smoke And Flames the current reported number of demons is 46,000 I Traverse the battlefield realizing this number is still insufficient I must think of ways to write more to increase the challenge the Arrogant monsters have become extremely aggressive at this point the Phoenix team is in crisis the boss's Health on our side has fallen below a dangerous level barely remaining the boss has entered a berserk State making the situation even more tense captain of the queen team reports we are still okay thanks to the support from Yu earlier our casualties are very low we are definitely able to get through this berserk phase the captain of The Mercenaries also speaks up my team also has yiwo support the boss's berserk phase is not a big problem but the Phoenix team seems to still be struggling damn it this boss's berserk state is truly difficult to handle Noah in the team paused to rest everyone immediately plunged into battle however the group began to exhaust the boss's attacks became increasingly unpredictable forcing everyone to remain continuously tense to cope woo and Shu shouted continuously what are you doing are you afraid the other teams won't gear even if it takes more effort we must hold our ground with several teams operating at the same time we absolutely cannot appear weak to be looked down upon by others Juku at this moment also stepped forward to add the leadership of the east region set you here to protect me yet I see that your Phoenix Cola team is struggling to e and protect yourselves go help them Wu Wen shu's expression immediately turned Furious our Phoenix colatin was originally the strongest in this dungeon but because of you woo I'm now subjected to such humiliation one day I will settle this debt with him demon of greed continued to Roar you pests didn't you come here for riches haven't you gotten any benefits yet do you have to risk your lives like this poor pests fight with all your might if you kill the others you can solely take possession of the gold and magic crystals gold magic crystals get rich get rich at this moment the crowd became increasingly agitated gold magic crystals get rich get rich the captain of The Mercenaries also fought back get out don't anyone compete with me whoever tries to steal I will kill that person he said damn it just because you say it's yours does that make it yours it's all mine mine the demon of gree was becoming stronger and stronger that's right that's right exactly like that fully un relas your greed to serve me to make me even stronger haha youu notice that internal restraint was avoiding his own desires this attribute is again quite similar to lust the desires temporarily created by the mercenary group are continuously enhancing the power of the demon of greed I must stop it unfortunately the level of the internal restraint skill is not strong enough it can only interrupt the power of greed yiwu grabbed the chainsaw and charged straight at the monster he shouted don't fall for the boss's trick it deliberately spews out gold and magic crystals to provoke your greed to strengthen itself the captain of the mercenary team suddenly regained his composure he said this trick is really terrifying our mercenary Brigade has always valued money above life if it weren't for Yu being here he and I would have fallen into this boss's trap we almost died he immediately stepped forward slapped The Mercenaries hard and shouted wake up a little just because you money shining doesn't mean you can't tell when to be cautious damn it do you want to die that one keeps looting without stopping gold my magic crystals mine so much so much haha with this much how can I possibly contain it all the captain of the mercenary standing behind wore an angry expression muttering senior what should we do now my subordinates are all low tier their Consciousness completely controlled by greed hitting them doesn't wake them up up with just the two of us how can we possibly kill the boss y Wu smiled confidently W said I want to kill a boss this is the best opportunity to subdue it the captain of The Mercenaries was taken aback unable to hide his surprise though I do not understand what Yu is saying at all it makes me feel that he is very powerful to be honest I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable but why have I never heard of a character like him before demon of greed laughed mockingly haha you want to subdue me what a Whimsical thought I am not a useless demon like those consumed by lust but you with your ambition are not a form of greed as well you are someone whose desires are greater than mere lust aren't you that's why you could overcome lust the demon of greed remained incredibly confident mocking you rely on lust to conquer desire but you cannot overcome this challenge of mine because it is your own greed that makes me even stronger Yu cly replied don't speak too absolutely creatures like you he delivered a powerful kick towards the demon of greed causing it to fall to the ground the demon of greed sneered its eyes filled with provocation do you want to anger me aha you are thinking too navely apart from greed I have no other desires however the demon of greed quickly got back up its expression excited now let me see just how far your greed can reach the team leader of the mercenaries warned senior be careful Yu held the demon blood Jade in his hand smiling as he said greed all my life what I have never minded hiding is my own greed in this era what is most abundant is also greed but my greed is not for myself the demon of greed grew more and more excited its voice filled with ambition demon blood Jade do you have demon blood Jade y Wu replied cheerfully sure enough demons like you are very drawn to this demon blood Jade greed's eyes immediately medely sparkled with excitement his voice full of enthusiasm of course do you know what you are holding in your hand ye Wain innocence replying oh isn't it just a key that can open the demon realm greed burst into loud laughter ha to have demon blood Jade and not know its true value this foolish human has never failed to disappoint me you should know this demon blood Jade is not just a key it is a supreme product condensed from the blood and power of the demon king after death upon hearing Demon King ywu could not hide his surprise and exclaimed Demon Lord he quickly regained his serious demeanor in his heart Yu silently thought although I had long suspected that the demon blood Jade served more purposes than just opening the demon realm I never expected it would have such a terrifying origin at that moment the image of the Demon King surfaced in y Wu's mind the demon of greed continued to explain demon blood Jade in inherits the power and essence of the Demon King whoever possesses it not only wields the power of the Demon King but also holds the ultimate authority to command all demons ywu stared intently at the piece of blood Jade in his hand his eyes gleaming with excitement he chuckled softly to command all demons this is truly a remarkable item at this moment he immediately raised the piece of blood Jade his eyes filled with greed do you want it then come and take it as the demon of greed how can I not be tempted by this treasure but at this moment the demon of gree was incredibly flustered murmuring no this Blood Jade is not something a low-level demon like me can touch while I do crave its power risking my life for a strength I cannot endure is still not worth it preserving my life is far more important Yi Wu immediately sneered provoking oh so you're the type who is both greed and cautious huh the demon of greed replied without hesitation of course otherwise how could I sit here and chat for so long with a human like you his attitude changed immediately his gaze toward the blood Jade became cold demon blood Jade is not something everyone is worthy of possessing only those chosen by it have the right to touch it if one who is not chosen dares to approach they will be consumed by it instead becoming its nourishment the demon of greed lowered his voice as if revealing a rare secret this has never been made public only a few demons truly understand this danger but precisely because of this more and more greed demons seeking the power of blood Jade are being turned into its nourishment the exact locations of their deaths are unknown he looked directly at ywu his voice becoming sharp How could a human like you possibly obtain this Blood Jade the demon of grieve became increasingly intrigued he squinted his eyes his voice filled with suspicion why not try to explain why Blood Jade would choose a human like like you as its successor this is completely out of the ordinary humans cannot inherit the power of demons Yu hearing this fell into deep thought he began to ponder the choice of the demon blood Jade surely isn't about me but rather the demon Destroyer within me this thought caused him to break into a faint smile and his attitude immediately shifted isn't this just perfect now you have even more reason to surrender to me don't you want to witness with your own eyes the birth of a new king or do you not want to personally taste the flavor of Power by becoming the demon Envoy for the Demon King Yu's words became increasingly tempting of course besides power you could also gain satisfaction on the financial front the demon of greed began to waver he sneered to himself to have me one of the Demons from the seven deadly sins surrender to a human don't joke but then the Temptation began to take hold of the demon of greed damn it it seems I have no reason reason to refuse him power wealth isn't this exactly what I've always craved greed is after all the source of my strength at this moment all the members of the mercenary team were astonished one person in the team exclaimed since I was a child I've only seen scenes of killing bosses or being killed by bosses I've never seen anyone negotiate or converse with a boss like this senior although I don't understand what they are saying it feels really cool the captain of the mercenary 18 was also taken aback in his heart he thought senior truly is a senior not to mention the boss surrendering even I want to surrender immediately but I can't I must endure I must endure after all I am the captain of the wild mercenary team ranked fifth in the east region the demon of greed was now kneeling on the ground his voice solemn yet determined I Grande greed am willing to surrender to you however shortly after he immediately added a condition but a demon representing strong lust like me when becoming your demon in void will bring you Buffs but simultaneously also generate significant debuffs I just don't know if you can handle it Yu was slightly suspicious Buffs and debuffs explain what are the differences the demon of greed began to explain the Buffs are divided into active and passive types the active type is when you must pay a large amount of money or power to satisfy my desires by using this method you can utilize me to engage in combat ywu softly exclaimed investing money to summon boss level combat power a fighting method that isn't bad demon of greed continued to explain the passive type means you will receive sensory lust when you develop a desire for something you will automatically sense the direction you need to move in to satisfy that desire upon hearing this Yu's eyes lit up full of Interest this ability is good isn't it the ability to seek Treasures on its own demon of greed immediately reminded don't be too quick to Rejoice I haven't mentioned the debuff yet if you allow me to become your demon invoy the only downside and the biggest one is that greed will continuously split I will constantly influence you causing Your Lust and ambition to increase Without End and this is something that cannot be reversed once the contract is established it cannot be eliminated or suppressed anymore Yu thought for a moment and nodded lust and ambition huh as for lust I have nothing to worry about on the contrary my lust has always been quite large but ambition that thing is a bit specific however this downside is completely worth enduring compared to the benefits y Wu finally asked his question um I understand now so next how do we sign the contract the demon of greed cheerfully replied it's very simple you just need to give me 100 million as a deposit Yu's face darkened feeling displ pleased with this method of contract your method of Contracting is indeed simple and crude truly not keeping up with the progress of the times outside the battle situation of the Phoenix colatin was becoming increasingly dire the captain anxiously said as the health decreases this boss is getting more and more frenzy we are about to be unable to fight anymore moreover we have no reinforcements continuous fighting has caused our team members to dwindle significantly and our attacks are about to fall behind Wu Wen Shu who was still old-fashioned disregarded the situation and shouted loudly I don't want to hear any useless complaints even if we die we must hold on it has come to the final moment do you want everything to be in vain to have the honor of the Phoenix colatin trampled into the ground but just then a warning sounded announcement the dungeon boss greed has been successfully subdued the captor yiu receives double experience and rewards and the remaining boss attributes are reduced by 10% the members of the Phoenix Cola team continuously rushed forward unable to believe their eyes what Yu has tamed a boss incredible I can't imagine how he did that one person in the team exclaimed upon seeing the boss's attributes have decreased Now's the Time everyone hurry up the offense and defense have changed it's our turn to put all our strength into attacking and killing the boss everyone charged forward in unison the proud boss has been successfully killed the lazy boss has been successfully killed meanwhile the Phoenix Cola team was still struggling but woo win Shu extremely angry could not bear it why woo y woo it's always y woo how does he manage to do that clearly I should be the one in charge of everything why does he always get to shine woo Wen shu's anger surged as he saw y wo come into view don't think that just because you help us I will will let you off your death is absolutely unavoidable it definitely cannot be avoided in the meantime the next announcement rang out the current number of demons the host has killed is 51,2 58 ye W thought this special Mission requires a total of 100,000 demons to be killed we're about to reach the final boss the result of killing only half is a bit difficult to handle at the Gathering Point some members of Queen's team approached their eyes directed at ywu look it's yiu coming I must quickly go and befriend yiu it will be convenient for future interactions someone in the crowd spoke up this is not just a social Gathering y woo back when we were fighting the boss you helped us a lot we haven't even had the chance to thank you yet I want to be friends with you is that okay not to mention it was thanks to Yu successfully taming another boss during the final boss's rage phase that we were able to defeat it smoothly exclamations of Praise Contin ously surrounded y woo V woo senior are you still taking Juniors under your wing and I also want to be friends with you senior another person chimed in you guys only want to cling to his legs Yu ran all over the battlefield to support us can we let him rest someone else teased you dare call us out weren't you the first to suggest becoming friends with ywo ye woo besides taming bosses are you interested in taming girls that are crazy about you woo hu and Shu from this side was extremely angry among the teams participating in the dungeon this time the mercenary Guild and queens team have clearly sided with Yu essentially we are left with only our the Phoenix Cola team could this also be a part of his plan finally jugu understood woo W Shu wo Wen Shu can't you see that y wo is truly exceptional perhaps the genes of yiu have been studied even more than those of a demon haha it's settled no matter what I must make him my experimental subject seemingly unable to hold back any longer wo Wen Shu finally spoke up enough we don't have time for discussions everyone quickly rest in place we are about to face the final boss we absolutely cannot be careless especially not like you all wasting energy on meaningless matters woo W Shu continued to lecture especially you ye woo from now on you were not allowed to act recklessly you must strictly adhere to the plan and the established regulations don't have a spontaneous mindset it's not always possible to subdue The Boss by chance like before next time you might endanger everyone at this moment the captain of The Mercenaries finally stepped forward why do you still dare to speak like that acting all authoritative here in this world Only the Strong have the right to speak if it work for ewo your Phoenix colatin would probably still be struggling in the boss battle from before the the captain of Queen's team also spoke up that's right the situation in the dungeon has changed now only y wo can lead us Queen's team will no longer listen to you at this moment everyone opposed wo win Shu you have no right to criticize y wo what if we don't listen to the commander aren't you also benefiting from Yu's Brave actions that's right not even a word of thanks to yiu instead you are here criticizing him do you even have a conscience wuen Shu fell silent at this moment muzi who was observing everything from behind felt her heart racing too fast almost unable to control herself but Yu was both handsome and strong did she really have the right to like him at this time Juku stepped forward you are not wrong yiu has indeed made many contributions to everyone there's no need to be overly concerned with superficial formalities the final boss hasn't been defeated yet everyone should avoid internal conflict arguing and harming Harmony is not good everything should prioritize the overall situation Yi Wu finally spoke up it's okay my working style is not something everyone can accept everyone please stop arguing and take a break after 2 hours we will begin the final boss battle everyone immediately followed the order still our senior is generous since the senior has said so I won't bother arguing with that Birdman anymore YW like this is indeed a form that a reliable man should have someone should learn third from him everyone make use of your time to rest the senior y wuas said it after 2 hours we have to commence the final boss battle understood wo Wen Shu on this side was extremely angry his so-called generosity is clearly deep cunning it looks like he's trying to ease the conflict but in reality he is unconsciously issuing commands to everyone starting to take over my management of the overall situation ye woo my patience is about to reach its limit after the final boss battle you absolutely cannot survive out of the dungeon Suddenly at this moment shy appeared from behind y woo can we find a quiet place I have something I want to discuss with you Yu was a bit surprised through he right after that yiu immediately agreed there's no need for that hassle let's talk here the two of them entered a space to talk to each other and so he asked skillful in spatial techniques ye woo do you have this ability as well he responded just a small skill nothing impressive what do you want to talk about sui looked embarrassed I didn't mean to ignore you before I was just trying to be humble and patient the ultimate goal of all this is to take revenge on someone this person is related to my background he is someone I need to kill and I only have this opportunity sud's attitude became Resolute after thorough investigation I understood that I am not as Juan Feud said a robot created from the jeans of susulu but the real truth is that we were both created from the same batch of jeans sui's expression suddenly darkened and she continued but one behind this is Juku from the east region he secretly colluded with Wang Fu day from Wang Jang creating a batch of robots secretly selling them to hang fui to be used for biochemical Transformations therefore it is truly difficult for me to open my mouth to seek help regarding this trivial background you have helped me deal with Guang Fu day so I plan to rely on my own strength to take revenge on Juku Suddenly at this moment shi's entire body began to tremble but I misjudged the situation this time and My Own Strength relying solely on myself I cannot succeed so y woo can you help me One Last Time chaos filled her heart what am I saying a person like me is not even worth Yu's effort what right do I have to make a request of Yu at that moment Yu stepped forward forward to support sui what you mean one last time he smiled gently no matter how many times I will help you with your matters sui seemed taken a back and suu approached and said so you really are just like me suu came forward from behind I noticed you at Guang Jang before I sensed a trace of similar energy within you you really are like me also a victim created by the hedger and the east region this time I came for revenge against Juku usually he is under the the protection of the east region and it is impossible to take action against him only this time do we have the opportunity to kill him both of them share a common goal chulu smiled with delight speaking of which if you all come from the same gene Yu said in a away you could be considered biological siblings sure I guess that counts chuu replied but so he seemed bewildered why can you all calmly accept such an absurd situation sud's demeanor turned gloy if not born from the same body you can't even bear the burden of this identity and fate shouldn't that make you feel inferior how can you still smile y Wu immediately comforted her it doesn't matter how you're born in this world what matters is how you live out your life Shi don't let the past bind you living joyfully in the present is what you should be doing Sulu stepped forward and hugged exoi tightly your background has been more tumultuous than mine but that's okay as long as we don't lose our goals and Direction and have the courage to keep living we can overcome any difficulties because in front of us the image of Y Wu appears forever there is a reliable man to depend on on this side the two captains of the two teams were still chatting back and forth Li woo regarding the final boss battle we want to hear your perspective the captain of the mercenary team said whatever the senior decides we will do it on this side the members of the Phoenix colatin were were still discussing among themselves the final boss battle is clearly a grand Team Battle they didn't come to us for discussions but went to that yu instead they are indeed a bunch of low tier teams not in the mainstream Captain we cannot let that guy be so arrogant any longer we need to quickly utilize the Divine artifact we've asked for wuen Shu realized something now is not the time to take action the strength of the final boss is still unclear once everything is over I will naturally not let him go the other person did not ask further and said Captain you were wise at that moment Juku also came over and said the Phoenix Cola team you are a top five team in the east region yet you let one person do this to you I have never encountered such a situation before but no matter how much you resent you woo you all must capture him live for me woen Shu became angry Dr Juku I think you might have misunderstood right our mission is to ensure your safety not to listen to you about everything Juku still chuckled you want Yi Wu to die easily but don't you think that would be too easy for him hand him over to me and I'll ensure that he lives a life worse than death moreover you will also receive significant rewards from the leaders for contributing important living experimental materials to the east region so wouldn't that be a win-win situation mu W Shu also changed his attitude since you have said that how can we not show you respect respect doctor jugu replied very well then we can consider this a consensus reached in muwen shu's eyes flickered a Sinister look if yiu falls into the hands of that mad scientist he is basically done for I can't help but start to wonder what kind of ugly monster that madman will transform yo into or whether he won't even be able to endure and will turn into a pile of rotten flesh on the examination table Suddenly at this moment the whole Space was sh taken what is happening what is going on you you all look over there a horde of monsters rushed in oh no is the demon attacking us proactively or am I seeing things the numbers are overwhelming more than the demons we've killed before run run away monen in a fit of rage appeared there's no scent of anger only cowardice creatures as small as these could defeat the six great sins how ridiculous the crowd became even more panicked is that the final boss just the oppressive power it exudes makes my hair stand on end we're doomed there are too many demons even if they Stood Still for us to slash we would know when to stop we're definitely going to die we are absolutely going to die the two CPP of the two teams were still trying to reassure everyone girls I know you all understand because I'm scared too but don't back down prepare to face the enemy little ones don't be cowards everyone take out your weapons I won't beat around the bush there's only one word kill Yu was extremely excited at this moment there are so many demons it's really to my liking perfect Yu Was Not Afraid at all stepping forward and saying everyone Don't Panic the next step is still the same rule you focus on dealing with the boss and I'll take care of the small monsters everyone was taken aback what the captain of Queen's team and immediately wanted to stop him facing tens of thousands of small monsters y Wu wants to handle it alone this can no longer be called a man this is a God the captain of the mercenary team also SED no wonder he is a senior not only is he strong but his character is also Noble always leaving the easier parts for us while he tackles the hardest bones himself senior you will forever be my God sui and Sulu standing beside said vwu just go ahead and kill we will support you that's right the others were still in shock can they really win it seemed impossible but why are the three of them so calm are we really from the same world as them a beam of light radiated this is an energy light screen useless anyway an army of demons on this scale won't last long the evil demons continued to want to rush in sui suddenly spoke up don't these demons want live anymore y wo on the other hand was quite intrigued hey hey is this all you guys are capable of how weak even breaking through the protective barrier is so sluggish are you really demons I'm not targeting anyone here I just want to say that you all are very weak the captain of the mercenary team was taken back oh my this is just too much challenging tens of thousands of demons alone isn't enough and before the battle you have to unbutton your pants is this to raise the hatred meter of the Demons to the max are you trying and get yourself killed senior you're so cool are you even human anymore seeing the monsters gradually wanting to break through everyone panicked again not good the barrier won't hold anymore the evil demons finally shattered the light barrier you want to die dare to mock us I will be the first to devour you alive yiu thought to himself successfully attracted their hatred next he saidulu at that moment she immediately created a wall of ice understood y thought step one use the ice wall to separate between us and the demons ywu thought the Second Step try to pull the two weak members out of the group he said do you want to eat come here you all have to chase after me first the captain of Queen's team stood on one side that girl wasn't she just recently joined our Queen's team she doesn't shine so it turns out she is powerful like this and is also acquainted with Y Wu Wu Wen Shu was standing aside at this moment benefiting from the situation he looked at ywu and teased vwoo you're really cool aren't you if you want to be a scapegoat just go ahead but please live a little longer you must hold on until I finish off the boss before you die right after that he commanded the timing is Right everyone break through to the spot where the number of demons is the weakest in the opposite direction Focus all attacks on the boss the three of them ran while trying to attack damn it the number of demons is really too many the more we kill the more they surround us deeper one person in the group side just relying on the three of us against tens of thousands of demons is still too forced Yu do you have any other way another person asked with a worried look despite everyone's concerns Yu still maintained his calm demeanor of course my plan is not just for the three of us come out here at this moment a giant monster appeared big brother why did you only release little brother now I've been so hungry for a long time y Wu excitedly announced then continued next is my favorite Peerless mowing model Yi wo immediately used Frozen Oblivion Soul calming Melody the entire space was now enveloped in Eternal frostbound Calamity although the battle was still ongoing a group of monsters was getting closer and closer every bullet y Wu fired was perfectly accurate monin in a frenzy rage shouted finally I found the weakness of these evil spirits I've broken through right in front of the boss everyone letun go it's time to attack it crazily he said luckily y Wu attracted the monsters for us making the final boss fight so simple isn't that right just look at its design it doesn't have the style of a final boss at all it must be because it has a 20% attribute reduction however monid inadvertently injured many people the captain of Queen's team was surprised and asked how could this happen the captain of the mercenary team also did not understand with a 20% attribute reduction how can the final boss still be so strong if it were not reduced how strong would it be wuen Shu maintained his initial attitude the situation cannot continue like this a group that cannot defeat the final boss must put aside past conflicts and accept unified command among those here my combat experience is the richest from now on everyone must listen to me after that wuen Shu immediately issued orders our Phoenix Cola team has the highest rank next our tanks owner will take the boss's damage the deputy tank of the mercenary Brigade will share the damage the two teams will alternate in taking damage while Queen's team will be responsible for attacking and healing everyone must work together to complete the attack on the final boss the captain of the Merc merary Brigade spoke up with criticism sounds nice but what do you mean by putting aside grievances wuen Shu keeps emphasizing that he and his team are very strong clearly trying to brainwash us into following him the captain of Queen's team also had a contrary attitude however in the current situation we can only listen to him at least his leadership is professional there are no problems monin was increasingly Furious the Phoenix Cola team firmly holds the formation so other teams can see the strength of a professional team like ours isn't it better to listen to our team leaders Commander early otherwise why would we have troubles like this he said but now they can understand it doesn't mean that we might not directly bear the full damage of the boss that can't reach the hirer troops on the field ha monin in a rage Unleashed energy causing the soldiers of the the Phoenix colatin to be taken by surprise what is happening why did the boss's rage suddenly explode like this one person in the team panicked not good the body was shaken by the boss falling into a state of paralysis what are the deputy tanks hired soldiers doing out there hurry up and help our main Force bear the damage monid in in a fury continuously released pressure causing that the Phoenix colatin to roll helplessly on the ground from a distance the commander urgently ordered it's over this boss attacks in a Range that we can't respond to after stopping the the ranged attack it charges in for close combat Captain this boss strikes both from a distance and in close combat comprehensively we can't bear it in another Corner the Queen's team faced a similar situation A team member looked towards Wu Wen Shu lamenting big sister the boss's continuous moves are too fast our recovery can't keep up anymore woen Shu immediately commanded her voice decisive all teams stay away from the boss use the kiting strategy to draw the boss away the the Phoenix Cola team is responsible for attracting the boss's aggro pulling it away from the crowd the remaining teams focus on ranged attacks against the boss some people said the strategy has been deployed and the final boss's Health has significantly decreased the captain of The Mercenaries praise I didn't expect this guy actually has some skills wuen Shu replied with pride you guys are too slow-witted the Final Bosses attacked are indeed incredibly strong but its defense is much weaker than imagined he cheerfully remarked it seems that the previous attribute reduction still has an effect the scales of Victory have tilted in our favor now everyone keep attacking like this the boss won't last much longer however the situation unexpectedly changed the members of the Phoenix Cola team were defeated a voice shouted it's over the main damage dealer has fallen Deputy tank quickly report move up the captain of The Mercenaries urged anxiously hey why are you suddenly Frozen keep commanding the battle muu Wen Shu also panicked and asked did you just get killed by the boss he was the main damage dealer with a lot of combat experience from the Phoenix Cola team his death means your Deputy tank is totally useless the entire mercenary team was stunned what you mean we are just a bunch of thin-skinned people waiting to be chopped down by the boss mon sidin filled with rage approached his eyes full of challenge he looked around observing the expressions of everyone before sneering hey hey hey your expressions are all wrong astonishment Panic fear those emotions are not what I want to see you should be furious I've killed so many of your people why does no one feel anger humans are indeed colder than demons Wu Wen shu's face gradually darkened but he remained silent mon didn't continue to provoke only anger can bring me joy I thought that with your large numbers surely someone would explode with enough rage to entertain me that's why I took the initiative to attack but what a disappointment you are all too weak killing you only makes you more afraid so behind him a group of elite demons appeared their faces full of excitement mon sidan turned to instruct them then let's torture them until they can no longer endure until they go mad break their backs first first the evil group immediately charged forward then I will break their limbs suddenly a voice rang out torture I have countless ways to use the people continued to scream help anyone come save us the monster immediately wrapped its body around one of the members of Queen's team what's wrong with you humans seeing your kind being tortured yet no one shows any anger do you want to come save them you make my head hurt we won't be able to complete the mission of the great raffle one it's seems I have to torture even more severely the captain of Queen's team rushed forward enough let her go if you have anything aim at me the monster was extremely pleased oh finally someone couldn't hold back and started to get angry H immediately its tentacles reached out tightly wrapping around the captain but he mocked only one woman dares to speak up and what about you men can't you do the same you're not even as good as a girl it's means we have to torture you more ruthlessly haha suddenly a sharp blade slashed through annihilating the group of demons ye wo quickly arrived to support the captain saying y woo at this moment yiu spoke up you want to rely on provoking our desires and anger thereby compensating for the 20% of attributes that are lacking do you think I will let you achieve that suu and so he finally returned I didn't expect the elite demons to be so easy to deal deal with this time thanks to yumu Leading us to fight the small monsters we have made significant progress compared to our previous levels the members of the mercenary team were also surprised wow that's right in just a short while their levels have increased dramatically so how many small monsters do we have to kill to achieve this looking at the corpses scattered all over the road everyone became excited again that's for sure don't you see that tens of thousands of those small demons are all dead oh my today is just too brutal Yi Senor is so cool from now on you will be the Eternal God in my heart the two summon dragons were still cleaning up everything satisfying so satisfying this Feast is truly too filling monid was incredibly confused with rage in such a short time you have killed all my subordinates Yu slowly stepped forward coldly saying I will handle this boss I think you all have no objections right hearing this everyone immediately changed their expressions what senior isn't taking a break for a bit just now you fought with tens of thousands of small monsters and now you're immediately challenging the boss although the strength of senior Yu is something we have all witnessed but continuously fighting at this level he probably won't be able to endure the members of the mercenary team looked at Yu with admiration one person side you fools cursing him now would leave no one to fight the final boss senior sacrifices himself like this is for us another person nodded feeling moved so that's how it is senior truly lives up to the title of senior making people admire him meanwhile Wu Wen Shu felt uncomfortable her eyes flashing with scheming ye woo ye woo you really love being in the linelight but that's okay if you overestimate yourself and insist on offering your head to the boss then I will let the boss deal with you instead sui was about to step forward but was pulled back by Kulu wait y wo you susulu said zi if you want to be a good woman then when a man has made up his mind do not stop him aulu stood behind and observed realizing the energy and Aura of Y Wu have changed previously he was always silent and introspective but now he exudes a powerful presence like an arrogant King monid enraged looked at Yu stepping forward alone and couldn't help but laugh mockingly haha human do you dare to face me alone you are the first to do this I admit you have a bit of Leverage to be so arrogant after all capturing two bosses requires some strategy but let me tell you this time I'm taking the initiative to Target you don't make me disappointed y wo said little immediately launching an attack he replied coldly I'm in a hurry your trash talk doesn't need to be so excessive system notification demon Destroyer account has been changed immediately afterward a loud explosion occurred monid was also severely impacted the explosion caused Panic among the surrounding people oh my God everyone stay away is this a battle of deities the sword energy from both sides clashed violently shattering both the Mountaintop and the ground mon sit in immediately changed form isora bursting forth he smirked wickedly how rare I never encountered a human like you monid in the Furious said rage is my source of strength my whole life I have yearned for rage but every time others Meet Me No One Is Not Afraid let alone daring to make me truly angry he charged into battle fiercely and you were quite good not only do you dare to show anger in front of me but you were also the first to truly make me Furious monid and the Furious swung his fist delivering a heavy punch towards y Wu to let me seriously immerse myself in battle like this a human like you should feel honored a loud explosion rang out causing those outside to become anxious the team leaders paused to discuss is y wo okay could it be that the senior is just going to conceit like this it seems evenly matched but Yu is still being suppressed even with 20% of the boss's attributes reduced he is still this strong how monstrous must his original strength be wuen Shu observed from a distance his gaze cold but unable to hide his Delight good this is the correct direction of development y woo you can rest assured and go die Juku shook his head a look of regret on his face what a Pity such a talent Must Die however the next scene left everyone astonished this is truly the appearance of the final boss Yu looked at mon seden his gaze Resolute even though I have countless ways to defeat you when facing an ancient God like you I can only choose the hardest path the people standing outside were extremely excited ancient God Demon what is he saying woo when Shu thought why is it that wherever there is y woo there are ancient gods is he just lucky or does he have some special ability Juku thought in this dungeon another ancient God Appears how does this guy know miden in a rage began to mock you know of the existence of the demon god you truly are not ordinary but I'm sorry my Master's intent is to kill you your name is y Wu right I feel like I've heard this name somewhere before the system announced the duration of the demon Destroyer account is only 2 minutes remaining midin in a rage continued to fight with all his might yes that's right keep going keep going the more you resist the angrier you get the happier I will be Yi Wu immediately seized manan's arm his strength strength was enough to throw the opponent over the shoulder causing him to crash heavily to the ground the onlookers cheered with delight so fast we can't see the battle moves between the boss and Senior Yi Wu watching the intense fight they whispered if this keeps up this dungeon will be destroyed fighting like this is not something we can get involved in he said vwoo is he still a human mon seedan Furious shouted out loud just moments later he was thrown to the ground he stood up annoyed and said this feels great fighting with you is really satisfying keep going I can hold on the system announced the usage time of the demon Destroyer account has expired and the cooldown time is 2 hours Juku began to calculate taking advantage of both sides being injured is the right time to use that equipment to collect the items I want the other person understood the intent so it's to capture the boss's Gene right Juku had a dangerous at itude no I want both the boss's genan and gwo monen filled with rage continued to attack with unprecedented Fury anger makes me strong anger makes me Immortal can you now compete with my intensity Yu tried to stop him but the situation was becoming very tense outside their teammates were extremely worried not good Queen Yu's Health suddenly dropped sharply our healing can't keep up anymore the captain of Queen team quickly ordered ladies hold on a little longer no matter what we must maintain Yu's Health on this side the group of mercenaries was also trying to provide support one person shouted the rest of you don't just stand there come help me save ye we Senor another person hesitated we want to help but is this really a battle we can participate in that's right what if we cause more trouble a different voice chimed in looking apprehensive he said moreover we might be defeated with just one punch the team leader of the mercenaries hesitated then said seriously you bastards is no one willing to help I can't do this alone if we act rashly it might distract Yu Senor at that moment the members of the Queen's team were also facing difficulties one person anxiously said Yu's health is dropping rapidly under the boss's attack our healing efforts are completely falling behind meanwhile woo and Shu laughed cunningly ye Woo you're still too immature you see soon enough your arrogance will destroy you the boss has only a little Health left but after it kills you I will use my ultimate move to deal with it killing two birds with one stone ha Sulu watched trying to suppress her anger she muttered V Wu's condition is not right at all it shouldn't be like this ever since he subdued the demon of greed he's become very strange I must step in to help him AV Vis Stood Beside extremely worried master I have monitored and checked your spectrum it is currently filled with greed risk and gambling please quickly change your account if you continue to use this account you will fall into despair yiu could no longer resist in fact I have already reached the limit but deep down I resist changing the account unwilling to witness the number of demons I have defeated just fade away like that the debuff after signing The Pact with the demon of greed appeared so quickly didn't it Monson INF furiously stood opposite him with excitement in his eyes human say goodbye to this world meanwhile wuen Shu and Juku each had their own calculations Juku sneered thinking to himself it's over Yoo everything of yours is about to come to an end the ancient god and the demon Bell on you will belong to me however Juku thought if both ye woo and the boss are seriously injured these two precious experimental materials will definitely belong to me though ywu was exhausted he still tried to block the attack not giving up at all those belonging to Queen's team and the mercenaries were extremely worried look at that yiu Senor has endured thousands of attacks from the boss and still hasn't lost any health I knew it the senior must have an even more powerful move left but there were some who questioned this isn't good why is there a blood red Aura surrounding yiu once Sid in in Rage couldn't hide his astonishment this could it be the blood Aura of the Demon King the system began to explain the host shows signs of being affected by the demon blood Jade due to a state of lustful Obsession this is a random event the host currently cannot actively control this power I VI was alarmed falling into demonization produces a common Bond indeed the demon blood Jade is only compatible with the body of a demon but this time ye woo may have encountered a disaster that turns into a blessing Yu's body began to emit a thick blood Aura forming an imposing set of demon armor miden witnessing this transformation couldn't help but exclaim in amazement this is an air of nobility and Grandeur that is beyond imagination but why why would the Demon King choose a human as his successor mon siden enraged seized the opportunity to launch an attack he roared this kind of power I the leader of the seven deadly sins clearly deserve it more than this insignificant human you don't deserve this ultimate source of strength return it to me yiwu immediately dodged and coldly replied all right if you have the ability come and take it monen was quickly defeated in his rage suddenly someone fell from above the crowd screamed in shock look it seems like a figure has been knocked out from inside the boss's body the crowd began to discuss oh my God he's unbeatable the senior Remains the senior no matter the situation he always has a cool trump card y wo is truly not an ordinary person every time when danger arises he always finds a way to change the situation he is indeed a man who inspires confidence I feel that Yu Senor is not IM mortal he is a Divine being in this world meanwhile wuw Shu was writhing his eyes filled with hatred he gritted his teeth and roared why why is it like this why is that guy being praise while all my carefully planned schemes fail ye woo I want to kill you right now and Chang is lying on the ground senior and Chang y Wu turned back with his old demeanor senior and Chang why are you in this dungeon and why are you in the body of a boss I Vis flew behind immediately analyzing Master according to my analysis there must be a human existence within the bodies of the seven bosses or more precisely humans who have been transformed into bosses in the dungeon their desires have been Amplified by the infinite power of evil ultimately leading to mutation the weak become common demons while the strong become bosses Yu ran over to check the situation senior en Chang why did you mutate into rage it must be because he has been continuously trying to heal himself without results the accumulation of resentment ultimately led to his mutation however yugu finally smiled it seems that this trip to the dungeon was not in vain I coincidentally found my senior senior and chain you don't need to worry anymore your sister has found you letun go back to meet your sister and Chang still lying on the ground asked in confusion who are you who is my sister yiu was immediately taken back a this analyzed the situation A Vis said Master he is not lying his spectrum is full of hazy gray and black probably due to Memories being forcibly erased by someone the host has defeated the boss of Wrath since wrath is the leader of the seven deadly sins the host is rewarded with additional kills currently the host has received 8,000 kills but the mission still lacks 4,000 more however the number of demons in the dungeon is no longer available if the host wants to complete the mission he must kill and chain the host of The Boss Yi Wu was extremely panicked exclaiming what kill and Chang to complete the mission of 100,000 which is still lacking 4,000 I have to kill senior and Chang only by doing so can I achieve the final 100,000 kills at that moment another voice echoed in his head as if urging him what is there to hesitate about having come this far do you intend to give up quickly kill him the demon realm still has countless Treasures waiting how can you let him ruin our grand plan another voice inside him immediately retorted no how can I kill senior and chain just to reach the required number of demon kills you definitely won't hesitate to abandon the mission to save senior and chain right the sides of goodness and evil are opposing each other maintain absolute reason do not let greed and ambition control you what is wrong with greed and ambition people only care about themselves Heaven and Earth will be destroyed everyone is like that isn't it Killing In Chain completing the mission and taking what we want however the goodness continues to fight back we cannot do that we should abandon the mission and save senior and Chang at this moment Juku is extremely happy laughing loudly great great this is so effortless he is exactly the best genetic material that I have always been looking for in previous experiments when I successfully merged humans with demons or beasts it was extremely unstable the final subjects all turned into demonic forms either dying or perishing but actually these are not the main points the mission of leading the east region for me is not to build a demonic Army but to find the secrets of immortality within demonic genes extending Youth and lifespan for the leader of the east region is the ultimate goal of my genetic research the leader of the east region really does not care who I used for the experiments or how I conduct them he continued in their eyes besides their own lives the lives of others are nothing more than weeds I only care about probing searching and researching the ultimate scientific truth no matter what means are used to achieve it in terms of tactics to reach our goals I am in full agreement with the leaders of the east region Juku true nature was becoming increasingly evident he said through countless experimental organisms I have discovered that the demon Gene is more compatible with humans than the Beast Gene however it has not yet reached the level of compatibility like the individual before me he is not only the boss combined with demons but can also live and maintain his sanity that is an incredibly precious material at that moment juuku immediately ordered capture the man who is transformed into the demon boss Zulu and so he stepped forward to block Yu hasn't spoken yet none of you are allowed to act recklessly jugu Finally Revealed his Ambitions he laughed loudly haha the final boss has been defeated and you are still pretending here no need to hide didn't you come here to seek revenge on me I remember you too both of you are creations of mine if you want to take revenge now is the time both of them immediately became angry you remembering is good but I'm afraid you don't remember how many crimes you have committed against us how you have created the tragedy Our Lives Sulu immediately step forward to attack since You' have been exposed then sui Let's Take Action Sulu continued to charge forward Juku your time to die has come Juku remained very calm is that so the modified creature at this moment immediately withdrew its body you shouldn't think you can deal with me so easily my body has been modified by the doctor it is Immortal Sulu was extremely surprised the body that I chopped up has healed and there are no wounds or blood the modified creature rushed at them didn't expect that did you the doctor has reached an extraordinary level in the study of ancient arts and I am also a secret weapon among 10,000 at this moment shui was knocked back and culu quickly caught him be careful it hasn't attacked us all this time because it was cautious of us okay but does immortal existence really exist the two people were still fighting regardless of whether it exists or not we must kill it Yu was still on in Chang side senior and Chang where are your memories from before and Chang raised his hand to rub his head I don't remember anything at all it feels like my memories have been completely erased leaving only anger and the desire to kill but why can't I remember because of this anger and Shain turned to him a look of doubt in his eyes your name is y Wu right how do you know me who am I in that moment Yu's inner kindness arose he thought to himself and Chang's memories must have been devoured by the ancient God Demon I need to find a way but within ywu another side conflicted then the problem has arisen if you don't killing Chang how can you get to the ancient God Demon ahead the current situation is a deadlock what will you do the two sides continued to argue there is no deadlock at all because you cannot kill senior and Chang just to reach the demon realm is one and Chang really more important than the ancient God Demon to achieve the ultimate King account you must obtain this ancient God Demon guo's expression darkened desire an ambition huh I didn't expect that this has already begun to counter my will however at this moment ye W struggled to stand up taking a deep breath if it were before I definitely wouldn't have hesitated for so long suddenly Yu spoke up this man please take care ofan for me everyone listen to this the senior instructed we will definitely follow your orders y wo you can rest assured to leave this place to us go do your work Yu looked around no matter what we cannot kill senior and Chang if we miss the ancient god of evil because of this and failed to obtain the ultimate King account I will have to accept the consequences Sulu and su he were still fighting relentlessly this old man Juku is hiding such incredible fighting Power it is difficult for us to gain the upper hand against him oneon-one but no matter what we must kill him this time the modified creature was still holding on very stubbornly if you want to kill the doctor you must pass my barrier first Yi Wu finally arrived to help leave him to me you all go deal with Juku right now I have a belly full of fire that needs to be vented yiu is fighting a robot the two girls fly forward and from there comes Yu's voice it is up to you suu let's go suu replies understood the robot flies up and uses a spatial isolation skill against the the two girls it commands stop right there you won't get past me where do you want to go countless manyi drones rise into the sky and start firing bullets yiu says your opponent is me however the robot uses its power to lock the circles around and protect itself then a loud explosion occurs and the sky suddenly brightens with an orange light the robot enlarges its body becoming a larger version it steps out from the explosion laughing maniacally haha I told you I am Immortal an attack of this level is completely useless against me Yu's voice was blown to Pieces but it can still regenerate after stepping out the robot raises its fist towards ywo and says surprised scared I am the advanced host the latest version not some worthless human like you could compare to Y wo thinks the ancient genetic biotechnology can reach this level it truly surprises people in his hands he held two gigantic machines aimed straight at the sky with beams of yellow light shooting up accompanied by Stones y Wu thought but this type of immortal body hack bug absolutely cannot exist its number of split rebirths must be limited I just need to keep killing him until he reaches his limit the robot's body would also be split apart along with his voice I once said that this has no effect on me so why don't you believe it the robot said the stronger your attack the faster my splitting rebirth speed I don't mind being killed by you continuously because that will only make me stronger the robot lunged to punch you woo but he had already summoned a golden shield although you are very strong after all you only have one life my life is countless even if I cannot quickly kill you I can wear you down until you die Yu thought they are not wrong I cannot gamble on this unclear number of rebirths I must find a way to win quickly I cannot let them claim to me the robot said to Yu there is indeed a way to break the deadlock in the weapon Vault mosy has created tools for the demon Destroyer there are still a few items you have never used before y Wu thought for a moment and then said what are we waiting for I Vis immediately began searching through the Armory selecting suitable tools for the current battle a miniature controlled thermonuclear restrainer appeared the robot joyfully announced master I found it this tool is absolutely suitable for the miniature controlled thermonuclear restrainer this device was originally used to bind the energy of small level thermonuclear reactions helping to restrain immense energy and stabilize the force field ywu took the weapon and directed a beam of golden light at the robot the robot responded useless attack no matter how many times you repeat it it will be ineffective this method of attack is truly meaningless will you not give up continuing like this will only lead to a four one at that moment a blue machine appeared in the sky casting a white light down accompanied by Blue lightning bolts the force field binding of this machine was directed at the robot and it announced even if you are Immortal beings once caught by this force field you cannot escape the robot's body was drawn into the force field yiu smiled and said you will have to live forever with that Eternal Body bound to this force field Forever Until the End of the World the robot said Dam it let me go a two girls also approached and one said damn these two women are so strong a man in a cloak said Dr Juku please withdraw from here we are about to run out of strength the bald man with a little gray hair around said why sh when how long are you going to stand there watching the show aren't you coming over to protect me haven't you heard that when we return I will use you as a living test subject the gray-haired man trembled and said said why woo y woo I have to kill you ye woo the bald man rushed forward and said what time is it forget about y woo don't forget your mission to leave the east region protecting me is the most important thing woo W Shu in a state of Rage at level 260 with strength reaching 100 points had transformed into a person with two long horns he said V woo kill you woo kill kill kill the bald man jumped up and said what is this why did woo Wen Sho suddenly turn into a new boss monster woo Wen Shu stood in front of the two and Sulu said not good wuen Shu must have been possessed by the Mad desire of a Raging Boss a man wearing a cloak looked around and exclaimed how is this possible how did the captain turn into the evil boss the man standing next to him quickly said Captain it's us get a hold of your don't let the power of the evil dominate you Wu w Shu brandished his sword charged forward and shouted Li woo I want to kill you woo anyone who stops me Must Die kill kill kill a blue-haired person observed shook his head and said at this rate woen Shu has lost his reason another blue-haired person nodded coldly said if he truly is the boss then we only have one option to kill wo W Shu roared charging straight at the two of them one blue-haired person thought to himself this new boss has terrifying speed his speed far exceeds ours wuen Shu used a rapid slicing skill leaving both of them struggling to defend themselves suu at level 220 had 25% Health left sodi at level 218 only had 20% Health remaining sui shouted in haste his slicing blows are too fast if this continues our HP will run out the brown-haired girl from a distance commanded sisters hurry up and gather to heal them we absolutely must not let their health drop to the warning level the blue-haired girl replied immediately yes big sister the brown-haired man said damn it I knew wuen Shu would not do his will is weak enough to be possessed by a demon the brothers crazily attacked replace you to carry out fire support the two men with guns laughed and said yes an orange light shown directly on Wu Wen Shu and he said the attack is slow y Wu smiled and said wuen Shu has been demonized how deep is his intent towards me Sulu said the new boss demon transformed by Wu Wen shu is extremely powerful and strange we best work together to attack yiu smiled at the two girls and said no need he is targeting me no matter what I will fight it is precisely because of his appearance that I can resolve my urgent matter right now there was an announcement determining the strength of the new boss demon killing the new boss demon the host receives 6,000 kill points thereby achieving a total of 10 kills ywu smiled and said so wo Wen Shu I must thank you for this favor in my time of me wo Wen shu's head sprouted two long horns and muwen Shu was flying in a beam of red light it said after being press for so long I can finally enjoy killing you ha this is the feeling of being Carefree fully releasing my desires so delightful wuen Shu was using the power of the red beam to fight against the yellow power of yiu it said if I had known it would feel this good I wouldn't have bothered Being Human y Wu was also struggling to fight against Wu w Shu thinking it's speed is too fast my defense can't keep up at all I can only rely on endless Firepower to suppress it countless small missiles were launched towards Wu Wen Shu unleashing all Firepower Wu Wen Shu said want to use Firepower to attack replacing defense with offense useless Yi Wu used the power of zigzag shooting to battle woo W Shu it moved everywhere and said your attack seemed to slow down tenfold in my eyes slow too slow yiu thought the shock wave was Bent by his high-speed airf flow and the bullets couldn't keep up with its speed countless mini missiles surged forward creating streams of orange light the robot laughed hardly saying I love seen your helpless expression Yu felt that the situation was becoming a bit difficult the demon Destroyer account does not fear oppression from power and numbers only fears opponents with high speed he looked ahead thinking that Wu Wen Shu was indeed the type with fast speed plus his mutation enhancement ability made his speed even more frightening Yu's eyes revealed concern as he knew that the second form of the demon Destroyer account had not yet had a counsil at the same time during the battle switching to another account was not supported by the system which made him worry about how to resolve this situation a brown-haired girl raised her hand in front and said sisters even though ye woo can defend against the boss's attacks and the healing pressure for us is not high we must not slack off we still need to continuously heal y Wu the two girls behind nodded understanding The Situation Big Sister a brown-haired man wearing a mask said damn it this is the first time I've seen senior Yu in an absolutely weak position damn it how is this woo wi shoe so freakishly strong a light blue-haired girl calmly spoke we must trust y Wu the dark blue-haired girl beside her also agreed indeed no matter what difficulties arise he will definitely come up with a way to resolve it Wu w shu is fighting against y wo surrounding y wo is a protective Golden Circle and a voice Echoes from within it Counterattack struggle are you really going to give up like this killing you this way feels too boring for me I still prefer the over-the-top Arrogant look you had at first haha Yu stands within the Golden Circle thinking if I keep going like this my HP will soon run out I need to come up with a new way to respond at this moment the robot beside her laughs and says Master don't panic I just checked and found the most effective way the only way in the current weapon inventory there is a box called M's last gift on it is a question when faced with an unsolvable crisis open it Yu is surprised there's something like that I Vis immediately opens the Box the robot looks at the silhouette of a person appearing and says yes master the man emanates a purple glow he said says finally you use this item this means you are currently facing an insurmountable problem if I'm not mistaken you must be dealing with an enemy who is faster than you he smiled extending his hand and said but it's fine I have long since seen this one weakness of yours and silently prepared a new set of equipment for you I didn't proactively tell you because I thought of your stubborn personality but now is a matter of life and death you must cast aside your pride and put it on to defeat your enemy Yu laughed and said the bond between mosai and the demon Destroyer is truly deeper than I expected countless purple Rays shot straight at yiu he covered one eye and said so I can't let the two of you down yiu had dawned a set of armor which was mosi's Final gift magic Hidden Paradise the brown-haired man exclaimed wow senior you look so cool this new gear is so powerful it's freaking awesome senior how many flashy equipment do you even have the brown-haired girl crossed her arms and smiled saying no wonder you changed my view on men y woo I'm genuinely becoming more and more interested in you wo W Shu pretended but it suits my idea because like this he swung his sword forward a red light appeared Wu Wen Shu said killing you in front of everyone will give me the greatest satisfaction die woo W Shu asked y wo why has your speed suddenly become so powerful F it's impossible Yu smiled and replied you won't know until you experience it yourself then he used his weapon against Wu Wen Shu the two began to fight Yu said I've defeated many who don't want to be human adding one more like you is nothing significant wuen Shu wielding a sword stepped forward and said it can't be can a single set of equipment really compensate for such a vast speed Gap what is the origin of your equipment Yi wo answered what you speak of is the bond among kin but how could someone like you understand that woen Shu refused to back down and said that's just an excuse for the week those who are truly powerful don't need teammates synchronized strength is only temporary Yu smiled and replied is that so you are still far from True powerhouses let me show you wo W Shu coldly asked what exactly is a true Powerhouse yiu kicked him hard causing him to cry out in pain ah wo Wen Shu Unleashed his rage his whole body displaying a power level of 260 with stats increasing by 40% and 18% suddenly a blinding ray of light descended causing rocks and dirt to scatter everywhere he burst into laughter his tone bitter why why in the end I have sacrificed everything to become like this yag still cannot kill you where exactly do I fall short compared to to you no clearly I should be better than you stronger than you a stream of bright red light appeared in woo Wen shu's hand he softly said his voice low and deep never mind I have been too stubborn with these trivial matters although I really wish to kill you with my own hands now I am willing to discard any Pride or arrogance just to annihilate you woo when Shu looked up his gaze frigid here it is my final move watch closely a dazzling pink circle emerged emanating a bizarre power sui exclaimed in astonishment this power such formidable energy could this be the ancient god of plague from Legend the group of people keep laughing great finally the captain has used the trump card hence the ultimate winner can only be our Phoenix Cola team the bald old man exclaimed in astonishment it's it one of the three ancient gods that have been modified in our east region Jupiter I can't can't believe this kid way shuen managed to borrow it he continued his voice full of surprise to control this ancient god the east region has spent hundreds of billions and sacrificed countless lives to borrow and use an ancient god it must go through high level approval in the east region not to mention the extremely high usage fees if weu Wen can borrow the ancient god act he must have had plans in place from the start he paused his gaze filled with a mix of disappointment and anger originally the plan was Flawless yet in the end it was ruined by that kid y Wu it's no wonder why Shuan was so enraged that he lost control of his mind to the demon suddenly his attitude changed his voice turned grave yet serious however the power of the ancient God has emerged everything is over of course to avoid Danger from the power of the ancient god our east region has long been equipped with special identification chips the blood plague monster reduces all attributes by 70% the power of that ancient god is truly terrifying the people over there despite continuously taking recovery potions are completely ineffective don't even mention potions even evil magic for Recovery is useless this debuff cannot be dispelled truly making one feel uncomfortable this sensation is even worse than death on Yu's side all attributes are reduced by 70% due to the influence of the ancient God's power the current situation is truly difficult suddenly wo W Shu stepped up in front of him and said weren't you supposed to be very strong yet in the face of the blood plague's power you can only sit back and wait for death out of my pride I didn't want to use this move but you forced my hand Now All That Remains in me is Fury toward you as long as I can kill you I will lose nothing y Wu angrily questioned if it's already Fury toward me then aim for me directly why drag ofs into this wuen Shu sneered and replied you're about to die and you still dare to teach me how to act as long as I can kill you what does the life or death of others have to do with me he stuck out his long tongue and continued don't worry I won't kill you just yet I want to torment those you care about first so you can experience both physical and emotional pain suddenly a blinding blue light appeared behind him don't talk too much it's easy to get hit in the face and I'm an expert at hitting others in the face he said looking at y wo with a cold smile I'm in the suppression of ancient god power do you still want to struggle Yu replied confidently isn't it just ancient god power that power shines down from the sky to where I'm standing let's see whose ancient god power is stronger immediately the ancient god reunited appeared his authoritative voice echoed human you summon me to deal with what trouble don't let it be too trivial or I won't be pleased a witness to this scene shouted it's the ancient god another ancient God has appeared next it will surely be a showdown between Gods the other person unafraid laughed loudly this ancient god is exactly what I wanted to snatch from you in the first place but I failed great this time I'll settle old scores along with new ones you looked at the ancient god reunited and asked Can you resolve the imminent danger the ancient god reunited frowned and replied you dare summon me without knowing my abilities are you underestimating me isn't it just dealing with something trivial this is simple the ancient god looked at jubo and said although I too am controlled by Humanity it seems you are worse off than I am jubo after thousands of years you have been tortured by humans into this state it truly brings disgrace to our ancient god Clan juo's brother coldly replied what do you know if it weren't to protect my my people I wouldn't have fallen to this plight the ancient god sneered so you justify Yourself by claiming it's for your people but to me that's just weakness 2530 years ago you made a mistake and now you continue to sink deeper juo frown his eyes filled with rage do you think you are superior if you were truly so powerful why would you allow yourself to be controlled by humans the ancient god lowered his voice pondering through I am also under control but unlike you I refuse to become their tool the conversation between the two deities grew increasingly tense as the air around them seemed to freeze the whole group was astonished the ancient god then spoke jubos before me you are merely a younger brother but this is reasonable as your rank is inherently lower than mine even if you taint this entire dungeon I can still transform this dungeon into the space I desire yiu suddenly exclaimed why didn't you say so earlier you can even change the whole world the ancient god replied that depends on you if you are strong enough I can make it happen the guy Wu Wen Shu remained unafraid saying it really is about trying to look cool even summoning the ancient god is like this I see that the ancient god you summoned has no attacking power only knows tricks like transforming space suddenly he pointed at jubos the weapon that binds the ancient god reduces most of its strength freeing 50% of jubo power he thrust forcefully causing jubos to scream in pain Wu Wen Shu laughed maniacally transform away you all keep transforming I can make jubos unleash even more pollution the ancient god looked coldly at his brother who was screaming jubos having fallen into the hands of humans and become the pitiful shape you are now you can only blame your own weakness however the ancient god was silently thinking just like I was at the beginning I was controlled by infinity and subjected to numerous experiments thus it seems that being defeated by Yi Wu is not such a bad thing after all at least Y Wu's humanity is commendable wo W Shu shouted what's this have you run out of tricks and decided to give up well congratulations to all of you you all Must Die Here suddenly yiu attacked him you are really too noisy immediately woo went Shu fainted Yu looked at him and said just lie down on the ground obediently and don't steal the spotlight a man standing nearby felt confused what's wrong with Y wo why did he only knock woo when Shu out why not just kill him directly sui added that's right even I want to kill him yiu stepped forward speaking calmly yiu does everything with a purpose and intention we just need to wait for the results then he turned to jubos I know you must be in great pain now filled with a burning desire for Revenge but as long as you agree to follow me I will save you and give you the chance to take your revenge yiu looked at the man Bound by strange energy robes and said you cannot save me even if you can free me from all the binding weapons on me I will still die these things not only control me but also sustain my life the ancient god behind him spoke up vwo I understand very well that you desire the power of the ancient gods even more but given jino's current situation you should abandon that idea having two ancient gods within you is already lucky enough it's best if I freed juo yiu smirked and replied just having one ancient God is Not Enough my goal is to capture all 13 ancient gods this statement astonished the ancient god Leo's Ambitions are too great he asked how do you plan to resolve jubo situation ye wo boldly responded no matter what method I use now I only have one question for you if I can save you would you be willing to follow me Chino remains silent for a long time before replying as long as you can save me and also help me take revenge on the one who tormented me then I Will Follow You yiu Laughed snapped his fingers and said then it's sell suddenly he said now I will come to save you immediately jubo was astonished right now I cannot control the pollution power that keeps increasing the closer you come to me the more dangerous it becomes for you the ancient god also agreed yiu replied jino is right even with my power to protect you if you get too close to a source of such a massive pollution power your body will also be affected at this moment the system abruptly switched to Mad account mode immediately Yu broke the chains using mechanical management skills to relieve most of the mechanical devices restraining jubo only keeping some essential parts to maintain life jino exclaimed in surprise I have regain control over my body and my power which Divine entity are you that can break these restraining devices that I couldn't escape from by myself the ancient god was taken AB mouth a gate oh my I truly underestimated this guy jubo knelt before y wo and Solly declared as an ancient god I speak him out will do it this jubo is willing to obey your command the system announced successfully subdued jubo has been integrated into the system as a magic item the current host now possesses three ancient gods he said not in a hurry let's change that hot man account first yiu said in a deep voice jino now you can go for Revenge jino opened his eyes wuen Shu was kneeling on the ground panicking jubo what are you going to do wo Wen Shu shouted in Anger hurry up and Unleash the Power of the plague for me kill everyone here however jino coldly replied the one who should die is you I will use the most brutal and painful methods to torment you wo win Shu couldn't believe it exclaiming what I can't believe you dare to disobey my orders no why has the restraint weapon on you disappeared he immediately turned and fled muttering how could this be that was the secret weapon that the Eastern region had researched for decades to obtain Chino shouted chasing after him where do you think you're going the pain I have to endure I will return to you H hundredfold immediately wuen Shu screamed in pain as the corrosive power consumed him he cried out it hurts I refuse to accept this I can't die like this I still have to kill y wo y Wu stood to one side observing calmly and said do you still want to kill me you'll just have to wait in line until your next life the system announced successfully defeated the boss wo went Shu has reached the required number of demons to kill the host meets the conditions to open the demon realm after that the system continued to report the dungeon has been unlocked and power has been completed you can now enter and exit at will it's a success we can return safely one person joyfully exclaimed thank goodness y wo is here otherwise this trip Tri would have definitely been more danger than safety the one who killed the final boss was y Wu he received the following rewards 15 million experience 8 million blazing demonic Wings devil emblem eastern district senior past level three at that moment the entire team became extremely excited all leveling up one person side actually playing through the dungeon with senior Yu is really enjoyable what started as a life and death situation turned into to a leveling Journey thanks to senior that's right another person echoed although we lost a few members this trip was certainly worth it even we made a significant gain and got some top tier equipment a few members of Phoenix were extremely upset the captain is gone what good will upgrading do for us how will our Phoenix team survive in the future Yu saw this and stepped closer saying the matter here is concluded let's go the captain of The Mercenaries immediately step forward we can't just let them go like this otherwise when they return to the east region they will definitely send someone to take revenge Yi Wu replied calmly they have surely reported the situation here long ago if I dared to kill Wu w Shu I would not fear the east region coming for Revenge muzi turned back with a reluctant expression asserting firmly I will never allow y Wu to be assassinated by the east region after we return I will definitely monitor every move of the east region the authority of the demon realm has been opened you can use demon blood Jade to enter the demon realm at any time Yu's expression was very serious he said now is not the time to enter there there are still two matters that need to be resolved the old Professor standing behind looked at everyone with a thoughtful gaze he thought even mu wenu who uses the ancient God cannot surpress y woo this kid will sooner or later become the greatest threat to the east region the old man tried to run away using the machine to create a teleportation door but now is not the time to think about these things I must quickly leave here to avoid their Revenge suddenly the machine exploded that's it the teleportation device has been destroyed the old man panicked yiu noticed and walked over his gaze cold you can't go anywhere the old man grimaced his voice tinged with fear vwoo do you really want to hunt me down and kill me we have no emity between us seeing that it wasn't working the old man changed his tone to plead wait don't act hastily we can negotiate ye woo don't you love money I am willing to pay a large sum to buy my way out moreover I can recommend you to the east region with your strength you can definitely establish yourself there the old Professor continued to plead his tone persuasive I know quite a few people in the east region if you spare me I will fully support you helping you become the top figure of the e East regions battle team I usually do not participate in such matters but this time I am willing to stand by your side you who looked at the old man his gaze sharp what you say to me is useless we indeed have no emity but the ones who have a grudge against you are these two beautiful ladies if you want to live you must ask if they agree the old man's face immediately became stiff he said that's right your target for Revenge shouldn't be me I am only acting under orders all of this is the arrangement of the leadership in the east region the benefits I just mentioned to ywu are also entirely suitable for the two of you as long as you spare my life before he could finish his sentence a powerful punch sent him stumbling to the ground the two beautiful women standing beside him looked extremely tense at that moment one replied coldly we don't need the benefits you're talking about killing you is the best benefit for us the old Professor lay on the ground in pain cursing you foolish women the Gen transformation project has been fully automated even if you kill me it won't change anything moreover I have reported the situation here to the leadership in east region you will be placed on the top of the Wanted list especially y woo he will have to face the entire east region the expressions of the two women darkened as they heard the old man's words he continued haha those who are unencumbered like you may not fear death but yiwu is different he has family are you truly willing to drag him into the abyss Yi Wu calmly responded I killed woo Wu that means I already made an enemy of the east region adding one more enemy won't change anything therefore suu Shu he you two don't need to worry too much the old professor's expression changed continuously no matter what I said he didn't listen are you all crazy ye woo that Country Bumpkin do you have any idea how strong the east region is the east region not only has military power but also the strongest Scientific Technology controlling both ancient gods how can you all confront the east region hearing these words yiu became increasingly interested you mentioned two ancient gods great I have to get them I will definitely annihilate this east region the old man's face turned pale crazy crazy this man is completely insane be human zi and seu F immediately flew up jukun die the old man immediately pulled out a siren and injected himself if you insist on killing me then even if I have to die I will drag you all down with me if I can take just one person with me that's enough satisfaction suddenly an explosion occurred this is the woo Wen Sho Jean after it has mutated which I secretly collected before I will use it to take you all with me the old man's body transformed into a bizarre octopus he screamed why why can't I be demonized Yi Wu smiled and explained it seems that even the demon Gene chooses its host a person like you not even the demon would cast a glance at each Swift and precise sword strike cut through go die he struggled to hold on no I won't accept this I haven't completed my experiment yet how can I die in the hands of you trash experiments no I will kill the head you gained 100,000 experience points you picked up the highlevel Divine skill book for genetic modification companion level two in the east region Sulu stretched comfortably I didn't expect my biggest goal to be completed so smoothly sui smiled gently this is thanks to Yu being here you two have talked more haven't you now I have nothing left to accomplish the most important thing for me is to be by Yu's side helping him achieve his goals she turned to yiu her gaze full of Trust From Now On we will follow you y wo what do you plan to do next the teleportation door immediately opened yiu cheerfully said there are many things to do next the first is to take senior and Chang home senior and changen returned to the base where y Yun F stood waiting she couldn't hold back her tears I'm so glad the two sisters are finally reunited I'm so happy for them an inquired about the situation and Chang it's so good to see you again again and Chang do you still remember me it's me your sister and Chang looked at her with a dazed expression sister I don't remember anymore Yu stepped closer gently comforting her senior and Chang no longer has memories of the past I'm sorry I cannot bring him back completely and immediately interrupted tears falling unexpectedly it's okay finding and bringing and chain back so quickly is already a great Fortune this is all thanks to you ye W as for his memories I only hope that one day they can be restored y Wu thought to himself senior and Chang's memories may not be able to recover on their own I must uncover the truth he approached enang and said senior enang you don't need to worry my plan is to help you regain your lost memories first and then enlist the help of people from the Breaking Bad Club to help you dispel the Beast transformation State restoring your normal human form and Chang seemed flustered can you really do so much for me when did I make a friend like you I feel so lucky I thought I was always someone unnoticed unloved thank you y wo for telling me everything that happened in the past so I could know and Chang tried to probe apart from the fact that I'm originally human there is someone who loves me thank you y woo upon witnessing this scene couldn't help but think senior and Chang may have lost his memory but he can still maintain his original personality which is a fortunate thing at that moment Yun Fe cheerfully approached brother it seems that this time you went out and returned with quite a harvest bringing back two beauties yiu scratched his head answering bashfully uh this is for the plan later the more people the better y Yun F looked a bit suspicious really but Kai XI probably doesn't think that way Yu stood awkwardly in the middle Yun Fe you know suu interjected her voice somewhat uneasy why do I feel that the current situation is a bit off Sulu was a bit confused isn't this the usual state she shines like a star but in her heart she thought y Woo is so outstanding the girls around him are more than we expected but looking at this situation probably she can't monopolize him the expression of sui darkened when did I say I wanted to monopolize you woo suu walked while changing the subject let's talk about the main issue y woo she turned back with a serious demeanor earlier didn't you say you wanted to build a super secure area what do you want me to do I'm not a person with nothing to do y wo thought for a moment and said through this battle I have had a fierce confrontation with the east region we need to accelerate the construction of the super safety area to prevent them from retaliating the uncle happily replied vwoo you truly know no no fear you dare to provoke the east region you are the first person to confront them headon I really like your unconventional style if you need anything just let me know yiu began discussing the plan currently we have moved past the stage of attracting and developing instead of passively waiting for the enemy we should take the initiative and play our cards first after this battle they won't declare war right away but will secretly send people to investigate me this gives us time to prepare he opened the guidance screen and explained the two areas near kosi are crucial positions for building the Frontline defense station however there are many beasts there suu Uncle I need you all to go clear these two areas both of them listened and eagerly said you just arrange it we will follow your orders no problem at all another person added during this time here I've just been drinking not doing any exercise at all if this goes on I feel like I'm going to die of boredom at that moment Sumi slowly stepped forward and said V woo what about me if there's anything need it I can also lend a hand Yu immediately divided the tasks of course I also have a task for you sui you and baby beetles stay at the base and remain Vigilant ready to deal with any dimensional RS in the sky should any unknown intrusions appear Yu continued Nana you go to k City to leave the construction efforts there this is very important and nothing must go wrong Nana replied her demeanor still calm is this task too simple understood after that YW turn to give instructions to the others Yuni and Kai XI you two will work together with laong and his team to eliminate low-level monsters and wild dungeons in the areas surrounding the safe Zone you need to quickly accumulate levels and combat experience so that you can be more effective in battles yanf excitedly said you can count on us we will definitely complete the mission after completing the task assignments yiu murmured to himself system how much time is left before the forced summoning of the Shadow King the system replied there are 12 hours left however if the host enters the demon realm before this time even if time is surpassed they will still need to wait until they exit the demon realm before being forcibly summoned by the Shadow King Yu nodded telling himself then there are no more issues y Wu immediately stepped into the dimensional demonic teleportation portal he told himself I should set off now a voice rang out from the system warning warning threat detected at the base anomalous intrusion suu approached him her face full of worry vwo what do you want to do I can sense a powerful evil energy emanating from this portal more oppressive than the demons in the dungeon last time yiwu smiled reassuringly there's no need to worry system silence the warning the alarm stopped but Yun Fe still looked at him anxiously brother that portal is very dangerous do you really want go sui also tried to dissuade him that's right you woo with consecutive battles like this your stamina won't be able to handle it yet y w remain calm I have to go because inside could contain the Lost memories of senior and chain Annie hurried over her eyes filled with concern memories of En Chang Yu I'll go with you Yu gently declined no human Senor and Chang have just reunited you should stay at the base with him don't worry I'll handle it by myself having said that he turned and walked away leaving behind a gaze filled with concern he looked back smiling lightly don't worry I'll be back the people outside reminded him their vo is mixed with hope and anxiety if you Woo is made of his mind then we all support him remember to be careful go early and come back early we will wait for you inside the dungeon demon realm Yu looked around oh I didn't expect you to be so hospitable fighting to clear the way to welcome me a monster slowly appeared haha human you finally came a host of other monsters growled and charged out this Dimension unlocked the ultimate form of the demon Destroyer lifting account restrictions all skills in the account could be used ye will immediately use evil magic the decision is yours jino the ultimate form of the demon Destroyer was activated a massive amount of experience was freely offered and I had no reason to refuse after some time of battle the monsters were left as scattered Bones on the ground Yu sat on the pile of bones sighing in relief the demon realm has been 80% exterminated I've gained 200 million experience head a gigant IC ruined Holy Temple appeared this was the residence of the evil ancient god the host may enter the system announced ywu stood up looking around not in a hurry after continuous battles my body is nearing its limits I need to rest for a while he took out the devil Bell using 10,000 collected evil souls to exchange for a Divine great artifact with the demon Merchant the demon Merchant slowly emerged long time no see my human friend you summoned me it seems you finally wish to take care of my business right the old Merchant unexpectedly exclaimed Heavens you are really cool where have you run off to don't summon me in such a dangerous environment he sniffed around suspiciously Yi Wu interrupted hey what are you sniffing at in here apart from the smell of blood what else is there the old Merchant frowned and replied with an angry expression no apart from the smell of blood I can also smell the essence of the Demon King hearing this ye would asked in confusion how do you know that it's the scent of the Demon King are you closely acquainted with him the old Merchant became flustered immediately stammering about that is it something I should tell you what a hassle all right since you have come here with such sincerity I will show great compassion and tell you listen carefully he lowered his voice and began to recount I was originally under the demon kingk command serving as the manager of the Treasures of the dark realm but after the Demon King died and vanished the dark lands fell into chaos I had to use the dimensional Vault to take the treasures with me in case others tried to snatch them away Yu frowned his attitude filled with confusion hey don't try to twist your greed into something Noble like that the old Merchant chuckled softly and replied you may doubt my character but don't question my professional skills the old man pointed at Yu with sharp eyes he said I'd have sensed the energy of the Demon King in this Dimension which proves that someone has died here the demon blood Jade in your hand has led you here indicating that you are the one chosen by the Demon King to inherit his power Yu frowned his voice full of sarcasm I don't believe your nonsense the old man remained unfazed continuing to speak as he threw a small Jade vial towards ywu inside this vial is a special blood you should drop this Blood onto the demon blood Jade and the truth will be revealed you ywu caught the Jade vial with a skeptical expression I Vis who Stood Beside ywu looked intrigued master I have check the spectrum of this demon Merchant he is not lying ywo opened the vial and dropped a drop of blood onto the gem in his hand suddenly the demon blood Jade Shone brilliantly the old man continued his voice full of solity this is the blood of the Demon King a type of blood that has absorbed his energy the demon blood Jade has gathered all the necessary elements to recreate the image of the Demon King a magnificent image gradually emerged from the light of the gem a deep voice echoed Treasures manager Nephi welcome the king ywu stood in shock staring at the image before him finally The Demon King had truly appeared he said the demon blood Jade chose you why is it a human but it doesn't matter anymore the fact that you were chosen proves that you are definitely not an ordinary person moreover your ability to reach the place where I was killed further demonstrates that you have not disappointed me you truly are the one that the demon blood Jade trusts Yu turned around and challenged is it possible that you were killed by the ancient god The Demon King immediately replied correct I was equal in power to it but it ambushed me the Demon King's expression became unusual I thought I was wicked enough cruel enough but unexpectedly there was somewhat even more vicious before I died I gathered all my strength condensing it into the demon blood Jade and then tossed it into a random Dimension if you possess the blood Jade you are qualified to inherit this immense power however there is a prerequisite you must kill the ancient god for me the system appeared with the mission the dungeon kill or capture the devil ancient upon completing the mission all of the Demon King's power within the blood Jade will be transferred to a special account ymu pondered for a moment then seriously replied I accept this Mission the demon king became cheerful and said very good you have guts it seems that the blood Jade did not choose the wrong person then with a satisfied expression The Demon King continued I have finally completed my mission and now I will vanish but facing my hair you surely know what to do nephie was extremely excited and bowed to say I understand to help you defeat the Devil agent God all items in the Treasure Vault will be reduced by 50% and if you succeed all items will indefinitely be reduced by 10% suddenly the Earth shook violently causing nephie to panic not good could it be that the demon kingk blood energy has alarmed the devil ancient god meanwhile ye W stood confidently facing the devil ancient god who had just appeared in a loud explosion calmly saying just in time I was about to seek you out the chaotic devil ancient god Aradia towering High above spoke judgment human do you really dare to come before me this makes me look at you somewhat differently but unfortunately even with capability you do not know your own limits and dare to actively offer your life after saying that aradus summoned rumbling lightning to attack downwards but then stopped and said if you hand over the demon blood Jade I might reconsider my intention to kill you and give you a chance to live Nephi frightened dodged and cold sweat ran down filled with worry Nephi thought what a danger we were almost hit arus said with a seductive voice I will turn you into a demon just one rank lower than myself so you can assist me in becoming the lord of the world you will gain immortality and become an existence that Millions will look up to as soon as she finished speaking the other demons all knelt down in reverence before you woo Aria continued to prattle on power status immortality these things no matter how hard humans try they can never attain but now as long as you agree everything will be within your grasp y w pretended to contemplate responding it is indeed very tempting if you can answer a few of my questions I will seriously consider your proposal nephy Stood Beside them a gape unable to say a word oh my God just a moment ago you agreed to help the king take revenge now can you hold on to some principles already you laughed loudly haha you are indeed interesting clearly a human yet you are as skilled in scheming as demons like us don't you want to extract information from me I will accept for I am also very curious a human who is not swayed by Power Authority or immortality like you what exactly do you want to ask y wo crossed his arms in front of his chest and said if you can kill the Demon King you must be quite powerful why then are you still imprisoned in the demon realm and do all the ancient gods separated by the demon Destroyer have similar limitations Aria replied with interest you even know the origin of us ancient gods indeed you have some skills right from your arrival you are asking such sharp questions truly testing the limits of my patience but since you asked I will provide you the answer Aria explained as you mentioned the 13 ancient gods separated by the demon Destroyer are all confined in different random Dimensions depending on the of each Dimension the abilities of the ancient gods will also vary however no matter how powerful an ancient god may be they cannot break through the dimensional walls he elaborated this is because before his death the one who shattered the shadow of the stars of the demon Destroyer set up a pledge the purpose was to prevent the 13 ancient gods from merging into one then Aria suddenly revealed his ambition but I believe that we ancient gods can never break through this dimensional layer a Radia concluded with intensity in terms of origin it is because my power is not strong enough not grasping the true strength that is why I began to cultivate the demon Cain I secretly became the source of power behind him helping him become Cain meanwhile The Demon King was completely unaware I only waited for the Demon King to mature then I would kill him to obtain the ultimate power thus breaking through to the dimensional Aria was Furious originally everything was going smoothly but when the time came for me to strike and kill the demon king before dying he transformed his power into demon blood Jade and threw it into a random dimensional already appointed at Yu but now you have brought that power back to me therefore I did not kill you immediately upon meeting but gave you a chance yiu was intrigued there are so many hidden matters in this story it truly expands my understanding of ancient gods nephie was stunned thinking to himself turns out the Demon King was merely a pawn of this ancient god you who asked loudly what is your goal in seeking to break through to the dimensional or what is the purpose of your ancient gods do you all share a common goal Aradia opened her mouth and said we are split off from the demon Destroyer each person inherits a unique trait and personality so how can our purpose be the same I inherit the power of chaos chaos is the origin that engulfs all things and it can be said that I have received a more perfect inheritance than the 12 ancient gods she raised her hand to the sky and power gradually accumulated in her Palm that's why I have reached the ultimate power breaking through dimensional boundaries while simultaneously absorbing the power of the ancient gods I use my will to become the soul master I want to merge everything bringing myself back to the demon Destroyer fulfilling the unfinished will to destroy the entire universe and all Dimensions you woo upon hearing this felt his mentality waver So This Is How They used the ultimate power of the ancient gods it feels like I have just discovered some very important information a question suddenly arose in Yu's heart Gathering the 13 ancient gods to unlock the ultimate King that the system once mentioned could it be the demon Destroyer unable to suppress his curiosity Yi Wu immediately asked system are you allied with the ancient gods making me collect them to unlock the demon Destroyer then control me to destroy everything the system immediately reminded host please stop your unrealistic associations what does destroying the world to leave nothing mean I absolutely will not engage in such foolish acts after Aradia finished speaking she turned back to the main issue I have answered your two questions now it's your turn to respond to my proposition what is your answer ywu bluntly replied your goal is to destroy the world but for me there are many people in this world that I care about I cannot allow you to destroy it Yu filled with righteousness resolutely rejected my answer is no pads that differ cannot work together Aria was Furious refusing you have no right and power to refuse you should know that only immortality and power are what matter the most everything else is merely passing Travelers a moment later the system announced that the ultimate form of demon Destroyer had been activated for the host in this new state yiu was ready to fight there was no other choice only Power could decide who held the authority over life and death Aria prag said you also possess power which is very rare I truly do not want to kill you suddenly yiu was tightly Bound by something and found himself kneeling he was confused what is happening his body seemed to be suddenly controlled by a force unable to resist kneeling Aria explained this is the demon crown with it I can command and control all demons Yu tried to remain calm but couldn't help feeling anxious I am being controlled which is one thing but you are human how can you be affected as well his body trembled a thought flashed through his mind this is not good the true form of the demon Destroyer is a demon that is why I am being controlled it seems that this devil ancient god is even more difficult to deal with than I imagined in front of him were four Demons of the evil Elite type yuang level 210 strength and health both full heni level 210 strength and healthful needle level 210 also lacking nothing finally zel level 210 in a similar condition a Radia looked down at ywu with arrogance her voice cold I have long discovered that your source of power also comes from demons but have the demon Crown no matter how powerful you are you will still be under my control she extended her hand now I command you to hand over the demon blood Jade to me ye W lost control pulled out an object causing nephie to panic and scream pleading don't if the ancient devil God gets the demon blood Jade everything will be over when it breaks through the dimensional wall the entire space time and dimensional fabric of the world will face disaster chaos erupted around them scream echoed a radus sneered her voice cold all your struggles and resistance are meaningless whether you live or die you will serve me haha yiu stepped forward slightly curling his lips you guys are quite something the system notification rang out the demon Destroyer account form has Bei Chu Yu gassed a mocking smile on his lips just letting you enjoy a little do you really think I would hand over the demon blood Jade already Ria was taken aback suspicious what impossible how could your demonic power escape the command of the crown Yi Wu quickly regained his composure coldly replying the Demonic power certainly cannot Escape but since when did I say I only possess this type of power I can devise countless ways to deal with you even without having to act personally Aradia burst into loud laughter haa you are indeed somewhat clever to think of abandoning demonic power but not by much nay human abandoning demonic power will only make you die faster because the rule of this Dimension is that only demons can survive ye wo immediately conjured a pair of wings and mocked if I were truly Nave could I have lived this long the demon wings had the ability to freely Traverse the demon realm which infuriated Aradia she yelled kiddo you're still waiting for a counter move then the devil ordered go kill him steal back the demon blood Jade for me the system immediately announced demon wings in the demon realm receive an additional attribute boost speed increases by 500% ye W secretly calculated then which account should I use to fight or should I use the most high account to go all out and become a demon Destroyer for once just then I viz appeared and protested Master given the current battle situation Mosa's abilities are too limited y Wu while sprinting for his life took out the Divine level Gene modification skill book and analyzed the situation he looked at the pile of corpses on the ground and asked why is that I this don't you see that the countless demon corpses below are my battle power the system announced again the Divine level Gene modification skill book has been used the host has received a new title master of biological scientific engineering this title allows the modification of living beings genes Without Limits severing inherent attributes and fusing any matter into new attributes however this is a highly dark and forbidden scientific technique requiring careful use then a giant hand stretched out grabbing an evil aite the man cried out um then he was crushed around them the sound of Screams echoed the evil light has been killed a gigantic demon carried a gigantic sword everyone fearfully asked each other what on Earth is this that its majesty and Aura can even be compared to our god I VIs delightedly said project forging gem enchantment merge the Demon's corpse with the remaining architectural metal and utilize all the titles of M High to transform this devil giant the Master's mind is truly like a black hole even when attacked this demon showed no signs of damage furthermore it continuously fired upon that group that group shouted why why are our attacks completely ineffective then this demon Unleashed magical attacks against them terrified They begged Aria God please come to our Aid Aria had no choice but to intervene slashing through several strands a useless bunch of trash their death is not regrettable a Radia looked up feeling emotional on the contrary this giant demon fits my taste perfectly now I command you to obey however instead of submitting the demon threw a straight punch at aradia's face the unexpected strike left Aria stunned he wondered how can a demon resist the command of the demon Crown at that moment Yu appeared majestically standing on the shoulders of the Fallen demon he coldly said this demon is dead how can it obey your orders Aradia Furious and blushing with embarrassment slashed down with all his might but his sword was blocked by the demon the rage surged Aria yelled human you have successfully challenged my limits of patience I will absolutely not let this go died for me a ria gritted his teeth his eyes full of hatred just a puppet made from corpses and garbage and yet you dare to stop me the demon immediately reacted striking with such force that Aradia was Dazed he couldn't believe what was happening how is this possible its power can rival mine just then nephie appeared curious and asked fighting evenly with my demon king how can a human like you manage that Yu smiled his voice full of confidence because in addition to using a large number of demon corpses for reconstruction I also added the 10,000 Souls of demons that I had previously collected nephy asked in confusion evil spirit don't you want use that to exchange items with me Yu sneered didn't you just say you wanted to give me a 90% discount nephy retorted well you still need to wait until you become the demon king before we could talk about that suddenly NEPA realized something wait even after witnessing the might of the devil ancient god you still want the chaotic ancient god to appear as a human you managed to create such a powerful demon you are indeed extraordinary but that's just about it the chaotic Heaven and Earth swirled and shifted the game of the one before him the power of the god truly was nothing this was a state where time and space were fixed in harmony it was truly astonishing be careful human the demon Merchant warned everything was gradually being devoured this devil giant before him could not hold out much longer he had to think of another way the chaotic ancient god still grinned savagely no matter how you try it's useless I am a God and you are a human that decides everything next is your time of death yiu remained extremely confident is that so I met someone who could be easily seen through furthermore I have said that if I don't need to take action myself then I absolutely will not intervene personally the demon Merchant was extremely panicked you're crazy at this point stop pretending while the ancient God's health is only at 20% quickly think of a way Yu was completely calm responding I have always said one is one two is two the chaotic ancient god burst into delighted laughter haha so what exactly do you have in mind can you kill me without making a Move Yourself there's a limit to boast you humans have intrigued me Yi Wu immediately combined three stones and calmly said it's very simple I will use these the chaotic ancient god was very surprised this is the Thousand eyed demon leus plague of Calamity attack juinor returned to oness he felt it was unbelievable this guy how could it be a human simultaneously at one time subduing three ancient gods lawn radio grew more and more arrogant but astonishment continually showed on his face he yelled you three are indeed the disgrace of the ancient gods a god reduced to the point of being manipulated by a human the three ancient gods immediately retorted Lon Ria you are truly the most ambitious among the 13 ancient gods but looking at your disheveled appearance now it's better to hurry up and he YW words to avoid the fate of losing your soul you underestimate ywo too much he is absolutely not just a simple human the ancient chaotic God looked down with disdain you should worry about your master first he looks like he's about to be finished if you want to obey it should be him listening to me continuous warnings echoed although there is no limit to the number of summons each summon has caused significant complex damage to yiwu's body yiu struggled to hold on don't worry I have already considered this situation and prepared CER measures he quickly activated support measures enhance all attribute resistance strengthen resistance to abnormal States activate high level enhancement for all attributes increase overall recovery ability use abilities in special drugs from mosai with this support Yu was confident that his body could endure a little longer I've this worriedly reminded even with the strongest drugs available Master you can only hold on for 5 minutes Yi Wu calmly responded 5 minutes is enough under Yu's command the ancient gods began to charge into battle in 5 minutes defeat the Devil ancient god for me only when they are willing to listen will I stop on another side the ey demon used a petrification technique while another ancient god launched a powerful attack Lon Ria was confused but his teammate coldly said sorry Lon Ria youu saved my life and help me take revenge since he has given the order I must follow the chaotic ancient god immediately used chaotic Heaven and Earth gritting his teeth based on low-level ancient gods like you even with your age you are not my opponent the reunited ancient god your chaotic power is indeed special capable of devouring all things but all things in the world coexist and restrain each other when facing me your chaos will turn into Clarity the chaotic ancient devil grew Furious thinking to himself damn the reunited ancient god its ability really restrains me why must I encounter it the reunited ancient god attacked while sneering Lon Radia y Wu is the one I chose if you willingly obey him you won't lose face after all why must you continuously succumb to the plague only to be beaten to a pulp what's the point these words made the chaotic ancient god extremely uncomfortable he roared enough I am determined to destroy the world and become the only God not a PA for others to trample upon the chaotic ancient god continued to Bellow heal me even if I die I will absolutely not obey you Yu laughed with excitement refusing to yield is because right now all that fills your heart is Rage to make someone submit you must make him feel fear I will make you feel that the ancient chaotic God was even more excited he laughed his voice full of sarcasm this is the craziest statement I've ever heard in this universe no one has ever made me feel fear ye Wu immediately changed the situation is that so Shadow King facing the Nemesis that once shattered you can you really not feel fear the ancient chaotic God instantly panicked he mumbled his voice trembling impossible absolutely impossible the ancient chaotic God began to shake that is the Shadow King the one who fought for countless years against the demon Destroyer this energy although much weaker than for is unmistakable but but it clearly perished why is it appearing now if the Shadow King has not completely perished then it will exploit the fears in the universe to recover its strength by that time it will become so terrifying that it could drive anyone to despair the chaotic God looked at the other ancient gods who were trampling on his body he roared his voice filled with indignation in the face of our greatest Nemesis you all foolishly want to die with him we must quickly unite while he hasn't fully matured yet we must kill him now he said this time I can feel relieved besides I have no interest in merging with the demon Destroyer I do not want to lose the independence I have fought so hard to achieve that's not wrong I also want to rely on my own Consciousness and body to take revenge on the humans in the east region who have tormented me the devil ancient chaos is losing control even more at this moment he roared you useless incompetent fools are acknowledging the enemy as your master you say it sounds good but isn't it because you are afraid of being unable to defeat him the ancient god reunited coldly stomped down the incompetent one is you understand the situation right now you are the one being Trampled Under my foot y Wu remained extremely patient asking once more I ask you one last time obey or Die the devil ancient chaos laughed maniacally I've already said even if I die I will never obey don't think I will be cowardly like those three and submit to you ye who could no longer hold back using Soul separation he coldly replied very well I will make you experience what is called suffering worse than death as soon as the words were spoken the light from yiwu's Soul ignited and a terrifying pressure enveloped the entire space the ancient god in chaotic torment was continuously pierced through his body the sensation of his strength and soul being torn apart caused him unimaginable pain stop it hurts so much he cried out in despair why being an ancient god can I prevent the agony that comes from deep within my soul he trembled unable to endure any longer stop I admit defeat I am willing to obey you just please stop tearing my soul apart his voice was horse filled with desperation now I realize the fundamental gap between us please spare me I will listen to you Yu looked at him his gaze sharp yet containing a hint of patience finally he chuckled softly retracting his power it seems that your body is more honest than your words if you are willing to listen then I shall spare you first yiu extended his hand towards him return now as my family I can promise that as long as you follow me and work diligently I will help fulfill your desires the ancient god L Ria had finally been subdued he was summoned into the system through the form of a magic Crystal the current host now possessed four ancient gods everything gradually detached from Yu's body The Familiar feeling of suffering returned but at least I had completed 20% of the main mission progress the points after using the Shadow King also decreased by 20% and this kind of suffering was still bearable abnormal State shattered Soul all attributes reduced by 80% maintained for 2 hours using the Shadow King for 1 minute and 30 seconds the total cost was 900 million due to the main mission progress being 20% complete the cost was reduced to 72 million yiu slowly stood up demon realm passed through the host system synthesized total experience points 10 million you have picked up the demon bracelet demon Crown Yu held the items in his hand demon Crown such a good item has fallen out the demon Merchant behind was extremely happy finally we have welcomed the new King it's just a Pity that there is no high priestess to conduct the crowning ceremony for the king ye W raise the crown no need I can do it myself the ey demon was very surprised crowning yourself breaking the rules like this with such Charisma is this really the new king we have determined if so you will surely lead us to recreate the True Glory the heavens and the Earth trembled the demon reborn my king please swiftly Dawn the crown and lead us the crown has finally been worn the Demons of the same kin simultaneously knelt swearing allegiance to the new king my master the great king your will is our mission your glory is our existence your command is the very essence of our being the Demon King has officially received all power the system announced the Demon King has converted into a new special account Master of the 10 sins king of all demons ruler of the Endless demon Realm possessing supreme power and authority you are the absolute Master of the demon realm every concept of sin is under your control this account is a special account capable of commanding all demons however to use it the life force of enemies must be consumed and soul fragments must be collected after the host became the demon can the hidden Mission Destiny of the can was activated the system announc currently there exist seven other Supreme Kings across dimensional realms the host needs to gather information and conquer the remaining six Kings to complete the mission notification system concentrate enough to achieve the seven Supreme King titles to master all things in the world becoming an existence that surpasses everything the difficulty of completing the king's destined mission is extremely high but there is no time limit the host can check the progress at any time in addition to the Demon King there are six other Supreme Kings the difficulty has increased making it even more worthy of a try the demon Merchant bowed deeply my esteemed Master now that you have become the Demon King overseeing 60,000 demons it is time for me to present you with this treasure y woo curious replied oh let me see it the demon Merchant took out a key this is the secret key of the demon king with it you can use the treasures in the Demon's Vault without restrictions he stepped closer and whispered the price can be changed at will after all these items all belong to you use them however you want yiu was extremely excited oh then it can be considered free right after a moment yigu returned to his normal State all right this has been a fruitful Expedition it's time to leave he thought the demon Dimension belongs to me I can enter at any time however if I leave the dungeon I will be forcibly transported to the shadow kingk world may I ask are you sure you want to leave the current to mention yiu confidently replied exactly I have been waiting for this moment he was extremely excited telling himself now I have four ancient gods in my possession I am not afraid of any enemies confirm leaving immediately the teleportation gate was activated the system announced starting the activation of the spatial teleportation Gateway a teleportation door appeared y Wu calmly stepped inside thinking if I can obtain the ancient God in the shadow King's world this time collecting enough ancient gods will advance another step just thinking about it makes me thrilled at the same time in the east region of the alliance's war team a meeting was summoned a man spoke up I believe everyone is aware of the purpose of this meeting the death of Wu Wen Shu and Juku was not a major issue but the problem is that the one who killed them is an unknown person from the southwest region y woo regarding this matter I would like to hear everyone's opinions the other Elders of the east region began to express their opinions in the past there was Intelligence from the southwest region but at that time no one took it seriously who would have thought that kid would be so formidable a mere kid still inexperience dares to confront our east region but there is only one path ahead for him death however behind him is Han Mo the manager of the entire southwest region once a war breaks out between the major regions the consequences will be incredibly difficult to predict even though my fighting Power has absolute superiority we must also carefully consider the long-standing trade relations between both sides the head of the east region continued the fighting Power of Han Mo and the southwest region is not what we should worry about the most important thing is y Wu in just half a month he has risen from an unknown individual to become the leader of the southwest region this unprecedented speed of growth is alarming according to our intelligence his strength suddenly increases at regular intervals starting from transforming into a blood dragon manipulating large meccas and recently he has even been able to control an ancient god I fear that if we allow him to continue developing y Wu will undoubtedly become the greatest threat to the east region we must eliminate this young Beast before it matures and turns into a true monstrosity of Destruction the elders immediately agreed it makes sense I agree one person said but just then the administrator interrupted if that's the case let's vote to decide those in favor of Yu's death turn on the green light those against turn on the red light please cast your votes everyone turned on the green light with only one person turning on the red light however the administrator still announced based on the majority the result is clear I declare that starting today a hunt order for Yu is issued on site kill him without leaving any any way to survive in the world of the dungeon in Ling way City the leader of the hunter Branch Christina was very worried Laguna y wo what are you two doing here this place is very dangerous not somewhere at your level can come the two of them reacted completely differently Laguna seemed worried while Yi Wu remained calm actually we came here to find the origin of the plague Yu explained we have obtained a few Clues the hunter Branch priest s and squinted in confusion clues about the origin of the plague specifically what is it Yu held up a key and said this is the key to the entrance of the sewers of Ling way city this city is also where the plague first broke out therefore we want to investigate everyone was extremely surprised to see the key to the entrance in the cup of water Christina flustered explained since the plague broke out all entrances to Ling way City have been blocked we have searched many times but found no way in who would have thought that this key exists sallan could not hide his astonishment where did you get this key Laguna hesitated to respond this was obtained from someone in the secret blood cult during one of our missions y added that's why we are also very curious ultimately what is the connection between the origin of the play in Ling way City and the secret blood cult after speaking Yi Wu fell into a contemplative State even though the fact that the key comes from the secret blood cult does not need to be concealed the matter related to the Twilight absolutely cannot be disclosed once the hunter congregation finds out about Laguna killing a fellow member Christina and Lena are likely to react strongly at that point the consequences would be unpredictable recalling the lesson from Marilyn's previous incident he had to be even more cautious in guiding lagona salian suddenly turned to Christina and asked what you think Christina still wore a doubtful expression although there are some confusing points I trust Laguna the logic of this whole situation can also be explained the conversation fell into silence but the atmosphere became more tense than ever selan finally agreed our mission this time is to enter Ling way City previously we had prepared ourselves to put in a lot of effort to get into the city but we didn't expect it to be so easy however the internal water system of lingu city is very complex and there are many dangers within the city Lagoon spoke up first why don't you hand over the key to us I replied thank you for your kind offer but I still want to go in and see for myself please rest assured I am much stronger now than before and I won't drag you down Christina hesitated for a moment San looked at her and then had to concede after all the key was found by them let them go together in the end Sally and nodded in agreement all right but you must pay attention to safety we will not lower our mission efficiency because of you too Christina immediately mounted her horse she turned back to remind do you understand Laguna this time we have a very important Mission so don't drag us down lagona smiled confidently rest assured we absolutely won't do that I even have enough strength to protect you young lady Christina hearing that Christina let out a forced laugh then thank you in advance you really are an idiot everyone stepped inside the Water Gate had opened and everything was going more smoothly than expected the sound of footsteps echoed in the space don't be careless this is just the beginning the road ahead is extremely dangerous everyone needs to be a bit more alert yes we will be careful in front of the Watergate of Ling way City another group of people also appeared the atmosphere here was truly gloomy accompanied by a foul stench as if from corpses soaked for a long time if it weren't for having no other choice I wouldn't want to come here to suffer I would honestly rather confront the monsters headon these were all members of the hunter Guild I glanced at the two people behind and said why do you two look so relaxed with your levels daring to run to Ling YC do you really not want live anymore Laguna forced a smile I'm not afraid of young lady Christina's actions the hunter next to him looked displease is this the legendary psychoan of the captain truly a name that lives up to its reputation immediately after another person turned to Yu and sneered aren't you afraid your level is only 18 just a light touch from a monster could end your life y Wu chuckled lightly it's fine during the fight I will keep my distance please help me out a bit everyone the other Shrugged then you better pray for yourself during the fight no one will have time to worry about you Laguna followed closely behind Christina Christina are you and your team coming to Ling way City to investigate the source of the epidemic as well she hesitated and before she could say more she was interrupted don't ask so many questions at your current rank you don't have the authority to know the details of this Mission Christina forced a smile all right all right I know you mean well and want to help but this mission is too dangerous just take care of yourself lagona grinned foolishly I understand now Christina is this you showing concern for me y Wu remained contemplative even Christina who is 150 feels it's dangerous it seems this Mission hides something more the boss at the Twilight had previously reached level 100 the danger level of lingu city that I estimate is likely between 150 to 180 suddenly a roar echoed from within what was that everyone be careful something is deep in the sewer it wants to break out suddenly from the sewer a swarm of infected rats surged out rats look out for the rats the hunters tried to dodge so it was just some rotten rats that startled me die already soon it wasn't just a few but a whole voard of rats pouring out as numerous as a flood he continued I've never seen so many rats before what's there to be afraid of even more than this is just a bunch of pests feel free to kill them but right after that these rats suddenly showed signs of a plag transformation they are merging and evolving and doing so in a spectacular way Ling way see even the rats and the sewers are creepy like this how can we fight against this the surroundings were immediately surrounded there were some here and the retreat route was blocked we're doomed we are completely surrounded Christina shouted everyone get ready to fight Don't Panic maintain the formation and prepare to engage she continued to command Laguna ye woo be careful to dodge and protect yourselves well other Hunters were continuously taken down and the sounds of please for help echoed everywhere the number of rats was too overwhelming my magic couldn't cover all of them he shouted consolidate the formation don't get scattered everyone was pushed to the wall all concentrated within the protective spell of the god Christina commanded concentrate your strength to take down each one in terms of levels they have the advantage but like this this slowly whittling down their numbers will give us a chance to win the three-headed rat kosi appeared extremely ferocious its level Advantage was undeniable he stared up in shock the boss has appeared level 170 how can Ling why City had such a highlevel boss the three-headed brat continued to charge forward why can't it be done as long as I eat enough my level will continue to rise and you all are the late night snacks brought right to my mouth everyone was not back the barrier of the god completely shattered selan Gravely injured blood pouring from his mouth stammered this boss we can't handle it Christina still tried to resist shouting we can't handle it but we have to fight otherwise we'll all die here she turned to look at her teammates you all go ahead I will hold it off the monsters continued to attack wildly the three-headed rat sneered at Christina hold me off I orig ly intended for you to be my final dish but if you are in such a hurry I'm also willing to change the order of my meal Christina gripped her weapon tightly her mind Racing for a plan she gritted her teeth damn it from the moment I accepted this Mission I had a premonition of life or death but who would have thought we fall into such a desperate situation before even entering the city just then the three-headed rat spat a stream of toxic venom towards Christina it laughed cruy adding a bit of seasoning soaking in flavors Christina fell to her knees in pain sweat beating on her forehead she thought to herself is this really the end no I haven't killed him yet even if I have to risk my life I must create a chance for my subordinates to survive this is the resolve of a captain like me blood sacrifice blessing technique Yu worriedly said don't do something foolish it's not time to be desperate yet laguno was still dodging lagon shouted stop it young lady Christina there's no need to use this secret technique of exchanging injury for injury yet Christina was stopped but there was no other way the three-headed rat was lurking making her even more anxious laguli looked at Christina his eyes filled with determination I promise to protect you now is the time to fulfill that promise he boldly moved forward Christina panicked and shouted laguno what are you doing come back don't Pro your life away for nothing Laguna smiled faintly the expression on his face suddenly changing it will all be over soon the three-headed rat laughed gleefully I'll eat you hunters and I'll gain a lot of experience for you aside from your tough mouths your bodies are all soft bones one bite and you'll be nothing but crumbs Laguna let his blood drip onto the ground coldly replying then today you've met some tough Bones the Beast drooled incessant ly exclaiming your blood The Taste is completely different from others It Feels So Delicious the three-headed rat could no longer hold back and lunge forward great I can finally encounter such human Delicacies I can't help but want to eat you right now Laguna provocatively replied come on then however a single slash made the three-headed rat try to slash away continuously Laguna arrogantly retorted as long as you have the ability the three-headed rat was a extremely frightened one strike nearly took my life damn it the swarm of rats gradually split apart but it was in vain you can't kill me I am just a bunch of rats as long as one is left I can achieve immortality but then a blood red Darkness suddenly enveloped the area around the three-headed rat this is no way lagona was losing control more and more he smirked compared to you the Flesh and Blood of your kind truly stinks after a while Laguna returned to a normal State he said I've cleaned it up we can continue moving forward now the people behind were extremely confused lagona are you using blood as a weapon that's a technique of the secret blood cult could it be that you the hunters at this moment still hadn't regained their senses although Laguna single-handedly took down the boss the techniques he employed were definitely blood-based there is no doubt about it that is the fighting method of the secret blood cult could it be that this kid Laguna has turned traitor Christina anxiously asked Laguna although you have saved us the strange fighting method like this requires a reasonable explanation from you Laguna did not hesitate to reply huh does this still need explaining didn't I just save everyone why do you still doubt me the expression of Salan became serious he spoke in a grave tone you are indeed right that you just saved us no doubt about that but but that's not the point the secret blood cult is a Sinister cult that brings disaster to the people destroying them is also the principle of our hunter Guild however the power you exhibited just now is extremely similar to that of the secret blood cult therefore you must provide the guild with an explanation what exactly is the power that you use Laguna immediately refused I'm sorry but I can't go into details about this matter however please trust me this power is only used to punish evil and protect Tech the week everyone was taken aback what are you planning to deceive and cover this up just like that there's definitely something wrong the hunters began to stir restlessly one of them shouted he must have sold his soul to the ancient god of the secret blood cult to gain that power how else could a level 35 person defeat a level 170 the way he looked just now was exactly like a blood sucker from Legends another person chimed in this is too dangerous Captain this kind of person absolutely cannot be kept around who knows when he might suck our blood Laguna tried to explain after all I am also a member of the hunter Guild how could I do something like that please trust me however the group remained unyielding one person firmly stated you dare to dabble in such evil power you had seriously violated the doctrine of the guild do you think you still have the right to remain in the Hunter's Guild y Wu finally spoke up in defense hey have you all mistaken the of the problem there is no Laguna right now you have already become experience points in the boss's belly I don't expect you to be grateful but now you must take responsibility in return trampling the weak is one thing but looking down on the strong man is another the backwardness of the Hunter's Guild has truly opened my eyes youu did not hesitate immediately Turning Away Hayes different religions do not conspire together they basically do not feel grateful we should not bother here anymore let's go laguma we will act alone according to the original plan Laguna sighed and also turned away Hayes but fine those people were determined not to let go just the two of you dare to venture through the drainage pipe alone but in this maze don't think you could take two steps without losing your lives yiwu's eyes lit up then let us see who can actually live to walk out of this drainage exit the system notification main quest progress 22% reaching 40% completion will allow for escape the group of hunters became increasingly chaotic this guy at level 18 is just being arrogant they don't even have a map and the first one to die will definitely be salian and's face darkened shut up his eyes were filled with killing intent it's not your turn to make sarcastic remarks yet whoever continues to embarrass me can go back to the entrance alone the group immediately fell silent yes yes we'll keep quiet Christina spoke up to mediate father perhaps we were too harsh on Luna earlier after all we have no evidence to doubt him moreover he even saved us Seline agreed with that viewpoint but there's no other way regardless of whether he is a member of the secret blood cult or not this strange ability of his cannot be explained therefore instead of keeping such an uncertain Factor by our side it would be better for everyone to separate selan immediately stepped forward to take the lead from here on out everyone cheer up for me don't forget that this mission is crucial to the survival of the hunter Guild they all replied in unison understood on this side y Wu and Laguna were still moving inside Yi Wu placed a hand on Laguna's shoulder and gently asked still worried about Christina don't worry the fighting strength from before was just an accident as long as she remains Vigilant with her level and experience she will be fine right now we have more important things to do so don't let this Troublesome matter affect your mood Laguna regained his composure haha thank you for your concern but I'm not feeling down because of this yiu looked a bit puzzled then what is it lum's expression became more serious in the past I thought that if I became strong enough I could change the Hunter's Guild but now it seems I was completely wrong the decay of the guild has nothing to do with the strength of power what is decayed is the hearts of the people and what can I do about the complexities of human hearts I can't help but feel a sense of helplessness Yu suddenly recalled the scene where the hunters criticized lagona that's right clearly you saved their lives yet they turned against you Yu continued this is both due to jealousy of your transformation from weak to strong and because you are a good person who bullies the kind and fears the wicked it can be inferred that these vile traits have deeply rooted in their hearts Beyond remedy Laguna was becoming increasingly angry so what should we do I absolutely will not allow our Ambitions to turn into mere Vapor Yu suddenly interrupted it's quite simple his gaze drifted into the distance his tone became vague if change is impossible then why not simply destroy it first and then rebuild it according to your own ideas Laguna hesitated slightly this method seems too tyrannical can it really succeed y will return to his original path of course it can to deal with can dogmas and depraved Humanity one must use absolute power to suppress trample and Destroy and only then can something be rebuilt on the ruins and this is not just aim that the hunters Guild ywu extended his hand toward Laguna Laguna are you ready to rebuild this world Laguna seemed hesitant do you what the world he immediately regained his original Spirit no no it can't be ywo I never even thought about something like this you can stand high and look far that's right the world won't be rebuilt and the Hunter's Guild will not change I must continue to grow stronger strong enough to rebuild this world yiwu secretly laughed all right I've successfully tricked him this time on the path of growth he will become an extreme antagonist never to return sorry this is your fate Laguna y Wu immediately set off oh dear it's another classic branching path Laguna obediently followed behind we don't have a map to the Watergate so which way should we go if we choose wrong we might encounter some danger Yu used his greedy sensing ability to examine the surroundings don't rush leave it to me a teleportation door appeared before them Yu thought having the passive ability of the greedy demon is quite convenient in mang man's heart I can find a way out of the Watergate Yi Wu calmly walked forward let's go this path Laguna Obed medly replied all right with you here I feel really at ease as long as I follow what you say there will definitely be no problem inside gu woo thoughts were swirling does this guy trust me too blindly to become a true Monarch apart from strength one must also bear the responsibility in one's heart it seems that aside from direct guidance some matters must be left for him to decide on his own his mindset must mature meanwhile Christina was holding the map this map of Ling W City conveniently includes the path under the sewer the hunters behind were chatting happily haha finally we haven't encountered any monsters on the road anymore the boss battle just now seemed to be an accident with the guide map we could easily avoid dangerous spots but those two fools probably don't realize it they might have lured the monsters away for us we ought to thank them Christina's expression changed a bit father do you feel that the hearts of the hunter Guild have unknowingly begun to Decay and twist perhaps it includes the two of us as well sallan did not shy away mom perhaps the first thing that changed was this world in a chaotic and unstable era it's unavoidable for people's hearts to become corrupt and twisted San continued we can only go along with it suddenly a cold wind blew in causing the hunters to shiver where is this cold wind coming from even the fire has gone out Christina seemed to sense that something was wrong stay calm maintain the formation don't scatter fathers sallan salian used his staff to create light thank goodness father is here but right in front of them appeared a swarm of insects when did these monsters show up a scene of Massacre unfolded accompanied by screams that echoed through the air amidst the screams Laguna felt a bit anxious I think I heard a desperate cry coming from behind are they really okay Yi Wu remained remarkably calm right now we don't have the luxury to worry about them if they can't even safely step out of the water supply they'll ultimately become a burden at this moment his mind was filled with thoughts for us the most important goal is to collect the fragments of the shadow of the stars in lingu City strengthen the power of the nightmarish Monarch while also investigating the origins of the play in Ling way City completing the mission to treat the plague assigned by the system and searching for Clues related to the ancient god therefore right after after that y Wu immediately made a decision Laguna from now on don't concern yourself with excess matters to avoid complicating things further laguma was incredibly serious as he followed beside him you can rest assured ye woo Laguna scratched his head and gave a forced smile I know how to differentiate M from secondary whatever you say I will do I promise not to involve you in any trouble suddenly Laguna noticed something unusual ahead wait ye woo you should look over there it seems like there's some movement at this moment there was no time for further thoughts Laguna quickly ran forward it seems someone is dating a hole finally we can meet someone alive I must seize this opportunity to gather intelligence y woo behind him tried to stop him hey hey I said not to meddle in other people's Affairs the silhouette of a girl appeared looking very Grim Laguna called out Miss may I ask he stood at the edge of the hole calling down why are you here alone digging a grave what on Earth has happened in Ling YC could you please share with us yiu walked over letun go if they are unwilling to speak we shouldn't force them Laguna expressed his regret it's hard to finally meet a living person and the result is disappointing just as the two were about to turn away the girl spoke up who are you when the girl did not receive an answer she asked again what are you doing in Ling way see laguma immediately sees the opportunity we are members of the hunter Guild here to investigate the epidemic related to Ling way City if you know anything please tell us everything the girl fell silent for a moment and Laguna felt a bit confused why is she silent when I asked this question y wo standing beside him comforted you should hold off on speaking let me ask in his heart he was filled with thoughts if the girl responds it means she can speak as for why she ignores Laguna it is likely because yiu stepped closer and began to inquire you must have had some conflict with the Hunter's Guild right that's why you don't want to have any relations with them until this moment the girl finally responded that's right Yu seemed to grasp the key point and his words became more straightforward then it's easy to solve you must have realized it I'm not a member of the Hunter's Guild so the issue I want to discuss is the one he mentioned earlier how much do you know can you tell me the girl immediately jumped up from the bottom of the deep pit you want to get information from me fine Kalia seriously stepped closer but you have to help me with something y Wu couldn't refuse that's not a problem a fair exchange is reasonable but with your level you probably don't need our help right CA sternly approached my sister is lost and I'm busy burying a body so I can't go live for her if you agree to help me find her I'll give you the information you want Laguna then stepped forward intending to intervene wait Yu don't you think this is really strange your sister is lost and she's here hiding a body instead of looking for her right away this doesn't make sense plus her level is higher than Captain Christina's y Wu dismissed Laguna's thoughts because her level and logic are unreasonable we should best suspect and expose her for obtaining intelligence ye W approach to provide an answer I promise you after all we still need to Pro bling white City it won't be a problem to help you find your sister while we're at it Kalia interrupted well we've talked enough now I'll tell you the thing you want to know y Wu was a bit confused so are you telling me now I thought I had to find your sister first before you would tell me Kalia moved closer to the steps and sat down I can't sense any ucer energy on you so it's fine to tell you in advance Laguna finally understood if that's the case it makes Yu's charm more appealing that's acceptable Helia continued Ling White City was prosperous and secure until that day when a mysterious group suddenly appeared they drove carriages into the city daging along a piece of mysterious Stone after that the mysterious people began conducting some experiments in the smelting facility and from that moment the city became very strange with a large number of residents falling ill with mutations ultimately Ling way City was completely sealed off turning into a ghost City Kalia became more serious surely you are also after that mysterious Stone fragment aren't you previously there were several Hunters Guild groups and people from unnamed churches that came through but they all couldn't get anything not to mention they ended up mangled and broken Kalia smiled strangely no one can survive to find that stone fragment nor can anyone survive to leave Ling way City Laguna was startled by this what does she mean by that Yi Wu immediately countered with a question how do you know about all this if you were just an ordinary person it would be impossible for you to know such things who are you Kalia hesitated for a moment me I wasn't an ordinary person she stood up holding something in her hand because I used to be a member of the Hunter's Guild and that mysterious Stone fragment was brought to Ling White City by our team laguma immediately recognized the object in her hand and was surprised that is the leader medal of the hunter Guild division Yu was also taken aback the leader luguna moved forward to question which department are you the leader of no at your level you must be from the guard corpse stationed at the Hunter Court headquarters ye woo immediately let out a soft breath if what you said is true then you must know where that mysterious fragment is Right Kalia did not hide of course she pointed towards the castle in front of them it is in the tallest building in the city Center but you cannot get there because along the way there will be various highlevel mutated monsters even those that die and then mutate into high level Hunters so it is almost a dead end I advise you to not to approach that place carelessly CA turned to look directly at yiu I have told you what you wanted to know now it's your turn to fulfill your promise and help me find my sister Suddenly at this moment luguna forcefully interrupted please wait a moment your words are contradict if you are truly from the guard Corp of the headquarters the mission you are carrying out must be confidential how could you bring your sister along even if all these unreasonable things are true Luna's expression was very serious then the consequences of getting lost in this dangerous Ling way SE I think you should know better than we do Kalia immediately fell silent and Y wo beside her intervened don't say anymore Laguna Yu stepped closer pushing Laguna back don't worry I will definitely find your sister for you I have always kept my word immediately after he turned and walked away luguna let's go however luguna still felt unconvinced V woo do you really want to believe her words ye Wu gazed into the distance the words of the living may be trustworthy but the dead have no need to lie on purpose upon hearing this luguna continued to express her feelings the dead ye woo do you mean her recalling the image of Kalia at that moment Yu spoke up yes from the moment I first saw her I noticed her heartbeat and breath had stopped moreover the blood in her body was also in a state of stagnation not flowing this proves that she is already dead right now she must be under the influence of some power still maintain the habits and activities she had when she was alive this is the most unreasonable part Luna's expression and immediately darkened I truly have not matured yet I didn't even notice these points and still argu with her Yi Wu comforted her it's okay take your time yiu stepped closer and placed a hand on Luna's shoulder if you want to grow up you must continuously go through experiences the road ahead of you is still very long so do not rush immediately you will notice the castle behind them moreover your doubts are not unfounded if she intentionally allowed someone to revive her as a vegetable it would not be impossible to mix in some false intelligence to create confusion the dead do not emit emotional Spectra making it impossible to distinguish true from false therefore in this bizarre city of Ling way it does not hurt to be more Vigilant suddenly a figure appeared what she said is not entirely wrong luguna immediately panicked you who are you the speaker pointed towards the castle that could it be the source of my power has it chosen me hearing this Laguna was scared is it possible that one day it will abandon me choosing someone else and I will become a weakling worth nothing the feeling of being vag in the face of One's Own power truly frightens people Yi Wu quickly moved closer to inquire so the source of the play that caused all of this is your fragment the other person continued I don't know if my fragment has this kind of power however the way my fragment appears to have power but with human ability there is absolutely no way to take advantage of it yiu asked further what if we had the power of the ancient god Yu's gaze was extremely Resolute for example the power of blood mystery Lord Beed the other person immediately responded then that's uncertain but speaking of the ancient god previously you only emitted a faint scent of hiding but now the stench of the ancient god emanating from you has completely become undetectable what is the reason for this luguna curiously asked the stench of the ancient god what does that mean why can't I smell it y wo awkwardly scratched his head uh that's because I'm carrying four ancient gods on me the figure immediately became surprised four four of them you you were more suitable to guide luguna than I thought my frighten is originally an enemy to the power of the ancient God if they are forcibly made to interact it will definitely trigger unpredictable consequences even if it results in an incurable epidemic would not be surprising so quickly retrieve that fragment this not only relates to the epidemic but also involves luguna the shadow of the person gradually withdrew as long as we can retrieve that fragment luguna in this world will be the ultimate existence system notification main task completion progress 25% epidemic task completion progress 30% ye saw the system notification and thought so the task progress has increased then the beginning and the end of the matter can probably be inferred now it must be that the secret blood cult infiltrated the royal family of the Kingdom leveraging their power to secretly transport the fragment through the Hunter's Guild to Ling way City and then stealthily using the power of the ancient god and the fragment to achieve some goal the result happened to trigger the epidemic creating the current situation Yi Wu looked straight at the tower as for the specific details I will need to wait until I get to the fragment to clarify suddenly the sound of iron axes echoed on the ground you were not allowed to approach a few extremely Eerie figures appeared strangers are not allowed to approach The Infernal dogs a team of hunters stood to block the way upon seeing those individuals luguna immediately recognized infernal dogs why why are they here they shouldn't be here y Wu curiously asked how do you know them or are you very familiar with them in Luna's eyes the side surprise there seemed to be an incredibly complex emotion what is this about luga explained they they are immediately one of them stepped forward to attack Intruder the attack on yiu was immediately blocked by Laguna do not come near luguna reminded y Wu be careful yiu was pushed back the opponent's strength could not be underestimated who exactly are they don't hide it anymore luguna at this point luguna finally had had to answer they are a hunting team responsible for guarding the great priest of the Hunter's Guild their nickname is infernal dogs and their combat power is among the top in the hunter Guild some others immediately rushed forward Intruder must not come near Intruder must not come near yeu observe the situation very carefully infernal dogs guarding the great priest that means their appearance in Ling city is obviously very strange lumu is still trying to resist that's right the great priest is at the Hunter Court headquarters of the Royal City yet The Infernal dogs appear here there must be an issue ye Wu continued to question even if their levels are higher than yours this still cannot explain the strange Behavior you exhibited earlier luguna luguna did not reply but y Wu did not stop continuing to interrogate you know very well that these three are vegetative beings so why are you still passively defending yourself now that you know they are easy to handle why have we take action lugumi hesitated unable to explain I the sounds of weapons clashing repeatedly echoed yiu stood outside continuing to panic could it be that you know someone in here so you can't make a move after a while Luma had completely fallen into a passive State and was defeated Yu's expression changed completely upon witnessing that scene what is your ally hesitating about luguna if this continues we will die here act for me luguna hesitated I at this moment he suddenly jumped vigorously launching himself forward damn it it seemed that There Was An Invisible Thread binding all the infernal dogs together The Familiar voice echoed strangers are not allowed to approach strangers are not allowed to approach repeated over and over again Luna's face darkened I'm sorry Yu I do have something difficult to say The Infernal dogs continued to struggle kill me kill me Laguna saw them continue ly screaming I am in so much pain kill me kill me Laguna Laguna tried to avoid everything you guessed right Yu among them there is indeed someone I know my hesitation is because of him but now I have made up my mind lagon immediately turned back wielding his sword I will take you to death a decisive slash but it was interrupted no I can't do it damn it I still can't do it at this moment Rio's figure gradually appeared strangers must not come close strangers must not come close why why won't you kill me Laguna was so helpless that he buried his face in the ground why why are you appearing here didn't you abandon the belief in Revenge to live like a dog just to enjoy wealth and Glory now in this half alive half dead State what's this still shamelessly begging me to kill you I can't do it I can't do it Yu saw him so agitated and steep forward to comfort him calm down a bit Laguna had never seen him lose control like this what is this person's relationship with you Laguna slowly stood up V woo we have known each other for so long I have never mentioned my past to you ha Laguna continued because it is a painful memory I am unwilling to recall it Laguna began to remember and recount it I was an orphan wandering around and at the age of eight I finally found a village to stay in as a result this Village was attacked by Bandits and I was the only one fortunate enough to survive after that I met a hunter named Ryo half-conscious I clung tightly to the Hem of Rio's pants his companions advised him not to meddle in other people's Affairs but Rio did not listen to them and ultimately saved me bringing me home lagona continued from then on I lived in Rio's house becoming the only servant in his home as well as part of the family Rio's wife and daughter were very kind to me when I had free time I would ask Rio to teach me sword skills because I also wanted to become a hunter like him one day although he often seemed absent-minded I felt very happy those Happy Days lasted for several years until I turned 12 one night Rio was out on a mission and was not home suddenly a few men burst into the house I recognized these men they were Hunters like Roo they had visited our home before they said there was supposed to be a large sum of money that could allow them to live a Carefree life but because of some foolish decision made by Rio he had ruined their Good Fortune lagona continued I hadn't even reacted before I was stabbed several times before I fell into a coma from losing too much blood I heard the screams of Rio's wife and children along with the sound of clothes being torn apart but I still didn't die when I woke up I saw Rio holding the bodies of his wife and children crying I knew that what I was to blame for was my uselessness that I couldn't protect them well I braced my injured body and told Rio everything that had happened Laguna said after Rio learned the truth he cried and laughed at the same time he said that being upright and righteous persisting in the end only harmed his own family cursing the gods for treating him this way after that Rio left the bodies of his wife and children behind laughing and crying as he disappeared from my sight I was eventually saved and nurtured by Dr Victor after that I joined the Hunter's Guild traveling everywhere to inquire about Rio's whereabouts in the end I found out that he not only did not break away from the Hunter's Guild but instead became a dog by the side of the great priest and he had never heard of any plans for Revenge related to him Laguna said I considered him a blow giving up on Revenge and instead degrading into a petty man who craved power and wealth so I pretended not to know him and did not mention our relationship to others lagona continued I used to think he was living a life of luxury in the Royal City but unexpectedly he died in this bizarre Ling way City what has really happened he wo held up a glowing vial to know the truth of what happened the best way is to ask him directly I just listen to you while making this luguna was incredibly surprised that that drug is truth revealed after death y Wu raised the vial this drug only has one bottle you must cause Rio to lose his ability to act which means you have to kill him once more Rio was still struggling lugumi turned to look even though he is in a state of living death now at least he can still act freely if I really kill him again then he will truly die I you who place a hand on Laguna's shoulder to comfort him the choice is yours you can choose to uncover the truth of the matter or Let Him Live Like A Zombie yiu continued this drug can also be used on other Hunters to clarify the sequence of events but it cannot reveal what happened to Rio nor can it take revenge for him your choice is hearing this Laguna finally raised his sword and stabbed towards Rio I'm sorry Rio I will definitely avenge you even though you owe me I absolutely will not neglect your death right after completing the mission Laguna quickly grabbed the vial of medicine and poured it into Rio's mouth so I need to know what exactly happened to you upon drinking the medicine Rio suddenly sat up in shock I have to kill those bastards from the secret blood cult at this moment Rio asked Laguna why are you here didn't I die why can I still meet you could it be that you are also dead or are you an illusion appearing before I die lud's face darkened upon hearing this I am not an illusion Yu walked over to Rio and began to inquire you really did die I used the medicine to temporarily revive your Consciousness you can only maintain it for 10 minutes and must forcibly answer three questions from me Rio finally understood so that's how it is at that moment Rya revealed the truth it seems that in this life I have done too many evil Deeds suffering the punishment of the Gods even after death I still have to be disturbed y Wu felt a tickle upon hearing this hey hey before we disturb you you were already bothered by the people of the secret blood cult forget it none of this is the main point y Wu turn to luguna luguna since you asked the first question it's a valuable opportunity try to ask what you want to know the most luguna hesitated okay immediately he moved closer to Rio and asked aren you next to the great priest why did you die in Ling way City Rio then responded what's the meaning of asking about this now back then I abandoned you luguna why do you still care about me so much Rio tried to avoid Luna's gaze are you looking to take revenge for me don't be foolish can't you just live well you are too naive y woo urged we only have 10 minutes hurry up and answer the question Rio finally had the answer this medicine of yours is truly miraculous although I didn't want to talk my mouth just wouldn't be controlled at that time my team followed the great priest to Ling way City initially I didn't know the purpose of this trip and didn't care either because the prosperity of lingu city is only slightly less than Royal City where to eat was not important Rio continued but over time strange events began to occur in Ling way City mutated monsters appeared and the citizens became ill on a large scale to ensure safety I once advised the great priest to leave lingu city but I was rejected this led me to start harboring suspicions one night I accidentally discovered the great priest alone mysteriously opening a hidden passage under underr the suspicion and curiosity compelled me to decide to stealthily follow but what I didn't expect was that deep underground within the maze a secret sacrificial cult emerged Rio continued at the center of the sacrificial altar there was a piece of blood red stone emanating a bizarre Aura with flesh and blood vessels sprawling around it dense and slimy a group of people dressed in blood red robes were chanting strange mantras with the stone fragment these people were clearly members of the secret blood cult but how could a cult exist here deep underground in Ling city where the central royal power still maintains control and how could the great priest collude with them I was still surprised and Confused Rio continued I didn't even realize that two subordinates had stealthily appeared behind me after that I was taken before the great priest at the center of the sacrificial altar the great priest showed no signs of surprise on the contrary he said that this day would come regardless the world is frock with Peril the power of the Hunter's Guild is too insignificant only the church its secrets and the ancient god can salvage everything he is my loyal dog I am very satisfied with his performance so now come with me to join the secret blood cult to worship the ancient god the great priest said with a satisfied tone all the others immediately chimed in that's right CPP join the secret blood cult this will make your life more meaningful in the face of the noble Faith living uprightly is no different from a Walking Corpse R was taken back stepping back a pace he looked at the two in front of him and asked since when have you two the minions behind closed in their Aura full of pressure one step forward pointing directly at Rio now make your decision Join or Die Rio Furious broke his initial calm hey hey there's no need to pressure someone like that isn't it just choosing a side after all I have nothing to hold me back Hunter's Guild secret blood cult as long as I can live comfortably it doesn't matter which side I join the great priest hearing this laughed with satisfaction I like your strong and free-spirited personality then let's proceed with the initiation ritual Rio did not move instead he suddenly drew his sword and charge forward his gaze iy initiation ritual wait a moment I still have one thing to do he grabbed one of the minions and pulled them towards himself his voice was filled with rage and resentment I have searched for you for many years without a trace I thought you were dead Rio continued I have given up never expecting you to hide in this secret blood cult no wonder I couldn't find you you were the Mastermind behind the murder of my wife and child the other person immediately scoffed hide no IED the calling from the ancient god and willingly joined all all these years you still can't let go of this Grudge Rio but now you can't kill me the great priest immediately spoke up to intervene stop Rio to join the secret blood cult you must forsake everything from your past no matter how deep the hatred you must let go if you kill him now you will not be worthy of joining what awaits you will only be death Rio's hand holding the sword trembled let go of the past for years I have deliberately numbed myself almost SU ceeding but as soon as I see your face all the lone buried memories rush back death I am not afraid because from that day my heart has already died Rio roared madly you never expected that before dying you could help me end this lifelong aspiration I truly have to thank you the minions of the secret blood cult Pierce Rio's body with a spear his face showed a satisfied expression My Wish has been fulfilled I have no regrets in death I just didn't expect to be exploited by the secret blood cult after dying but fortunately I met you all go ahead and ask the last two questions I should be freed now Yu turned to look at luguna who was trembling uncontrollably it seems luguna finds it very hard to accept this harsh reality but this is the path you must take y w immediately seize the opportunity the second question the sacrificial Altar and the Mysterious Stone fragment of the secret blood cult do you know exactly where they are upon hearing Rio happily replied you asked the right person for this question everywhere I went I drew maps for intelligence he took out a map frame and placed it on the ground this is the layup map of the central Castle in Ling way City and it marks the location of the secret passage leading to the underground sacrificial altar this secret passage is very discreet if I hadn't followed the great priest I wouldn't have been able to discover its existence receiving the handdrawn map of the Ling way City Castle y Wu happily accepted it professional as expected of a high level Hunter after that Yu continued I have finished asking the questions I wanted to know luguna this last question is for you surely you have other doubts luguna immediately seized the opportunity he said seriously in the past I always viewed you as a Target to pursue wanting to become a skilled Hunter like you but then luguna suddenly recalled the horrific scenes from the past at that time I was too weak unable to protect them well but you did not express anything to me not even anger or resentment just left like that luguna trembled all over his voice mixed with bitterness even if I am the Stray Dog you picked up from the pile of corpses unable to take good care of the house at least you should have scolded me a few times why did you just leave without asking anything in your eyes what exactly am I hearing this Roo was taken aback he fell silent his gaze complex seemingly unsure of how to respond RI immediately burst into laughter his voice full of sarcasm you're right you were the Stray Dog I picked up from the pile of corpses weak and frail aha did you think that just because I took you in I would necessarily develop feelings for you his whole body trembled his voice laced with bitterness originally I thought you could do some work like taking care of the house the result is truly disappointing in my eyes you are nothing but Yu interrupted I advise you not to hold back any longer this drug forces you to speak the truth you can't utter words that go against your heart time is running out do you really want luguna to suffer for the rest of his life because of you at this point Rio finally decided to be honest he sighed his expression heavy so that's it this isn't the outcome I wanted R looked directly at luguna luguna perhaps I have never told you but I have a son right I want instructed my wife and children not to disclose this to you he continued his voice full of Sorrow because I was too stubborn I treated him very strictly determined to make him the strongest Hunter but in the end the pressure from me became unbearable for him he couldn't resist he couldn't escape and then he chose a path of no return R was in immense pain that was my fault and I can never forgive myself for it it wasn't until that day when I saw you gripping my Pat leg amidst the debri that I realized your appearance was so similar to my deceased sons that I took you home I thought you were a blessing from the gods a chance for me to start over although you both looked so alike your personalities were completely different my son was unwilling to learn martial arts whereas you willingly train hard however I still couldn't pass on the real skills to you Rio continued the reason was that I didn't want you to follow in the footsteps of my son so I always Tred to keep my distance wanting you to live your your life in your own way but what happened that day made me realize that if you continued to stay by my side it would only bring more danger therefore I decided to leave however I immediately asked Dr Victor to take care of you while I resolved to disappear from your life I thought that only by distancing myself from you and allowing you to forget me could you truly grow up and live safely but I was wrong real looked up at Luman and said I never imagined my thoughts would influence you causing you to suffer I am truly sorry Rio finally could Embrace luguna openly you are the gift that heaven has given me the one who has redeemed me and given me a chance to be reborn but more importantly you were the child I love the most Rio did not have much time left he whispered one last time this time I truly have no regrets luguna tightly held the cold body of Rio crying out in deep pain don't worry my son you will become the strongest Hunter the space around luguna is now enveloped in infinite sorrow the system announced main mission progress 34% Yu tried to create a protective barrier Mission progress increases directly by 10% from this it can be seen that Rio is indeed very important to luguna it's just too bad that Luna's life has encountered so many tragedies I hope I can find another way to make him feel happy the sword was still firmly planted in the ground a testament to Rio's sacrifice yiu approached gently softly saying luguna Rio in his final moments was able to see you his soul has been redeemed as he said he truly has no more regrets luguna remained lost in an unstable State his eyes blurred as he looked at yiwu yiu gently reiterated I know Yi wo luguna tried to hide his emotions the hunter Guild the secret blood cult and this entire world are all rotting I Must Destroy it then build a new world but to do that I need power greater power suddenly a cold voice came from behind power what do you need power for because before long you'll become fertilizer for our secret blood cult haha you might even unleash blood energy stronger than Bloodstone looks like this time I'm going to achieve great success luguna frantically turned around his gaze sharp I'm in mourning and you dare to poke at my gun's mouth the man sneered you Hunters Guild haven't you sent countless people here in the end they all became blood supply materials for us are you out of people that you still dare to send a bunch of second tier level 30s to offer their lives seeing the strange man in front of him Yu thought to himself Christina's purpose for this trip is definitely to reclaim the fragment of the shadow of the stars but with their current level in Ling City it's really no different from seeking death luguna doved down from above his sharp gaze fixed the more nonsense you spout the faster you will die the strange creature laughed loudly filled with excitement I didn't expect such a big mouth coming from a little punk without giving him a chance to react luguna launched a direct attack striking straight at the enemy he was violently shaken his face showing clear astonishment how is this possible you are clearly only at level 35 how could you have such strength the secret blood Transformer immediately recovered his expression turning Fierce it doesn't matter in front of the secret blood Cults secret techniques no matter how much strength you hide it's useless he charged forward unleashing a full force strike aimed directly at Laguna you see this is the secret technique and the divine power bestowed upon me before me you only have two choices obey or die however what no one expected happened lugumi easily blocked that full force attack with just one finger the enemy froze his face pale it can't be a single finger can block my full force blow luguna remained calm his gaze unwavering just now you mentioned that what you used was the secret technique of the secret blood cult then the plague that is ravaging the country must have been caused by you right if so you must surely have the antidote the secret blood Transformer was shaken his emotions visibly in turmoil what what does it have to do with you why shouldn't I reveal the secrets of the secret blood cult to you moreover I haven't lost yet he roared his body filled with murderous intent inject it inject it all I never thought I would have a day to unleash all my power this is because you forced me after completing the transformation he became a level 210 secret blood Transformer powerful and destructive his voice was arrogant and SMUD once I enter this state I will kill endlessly your death is coming he laughed loudly full of arrogance you are really stupid truly foolish to force me to this extent do you know how terrifying my state is from now on everything I see will be killed by me no it must be killed in the cruestv to his body and starting to suck his blood he screamed these monsters are sucking my blood let me go my blood is the blessing of the ancient god how can I let you pollute it luguna stood at a distance his voice cold the suffering you caused Rio I will return it double to you the secret blood Transformer was getting weaker his breath sporadic he struggled to plead wait who is r i don't know him why should his enemies be counted against me spare me I was just pretending to scare you he said I tell you all don't suck anymore it hurts too much y Wu standing beside also advised luguna I understand your feelings but right now we cannot kill them luguna tried to appear calm I had my limits I have not lost my rationality out of anger however he continued to tighten his grip I must make him endure enough torment and suffering the secret blood Transformer lay writhing on the ground moaning if you want to kill me just give me a clean cut I can't stand this suffering anymore at this moment Yu slowly approached and said as long as you answer my question honestly I will grant you a comfortable death the man dragged his frail body slowly raising his face say it as long as you let me die comfortably I will tell you anything y woo got to the point without beating around the bush what is the purpose of the secret blood cult causing so much trouble in lingi the secret blood Transformer trembled and replied it is to summon the ancient godbe the ancient godbe is the deity that our secret blood cult worships even if he doesn't fully descend he can still guide us from the chaotic void at the same time he uses his Supreme blood Essence to bestow power upon us but this world has invisibly rejected his descent we know that within the Hunter's Guild there is a bloodstone containing tremendous blood chai power he said it can be used to help the ancient God descend therefore our secret blood cult has secretly spent a long time brainwashing and corroding the will of the great priest of the Hunter's Guild taking advantage of his authority to transport Bloodstone to the secret altar in this Ling wec but when using Bloodstone to conduct the summoning everything went arai the power of the ancient god in Bloodstone generated a strong repulsion this reaction led to the decay of the ancient God's flesh triggering an outbreak of disease Blood Stone also became extremely unstable the power it emanates makes people both intoxicated and amazed but to maintain it it requires a large amount of flesh and blood from the ancient God we hope that it will soon synchronize with the blood of the ancient God helping the blood Master to descend soon yiwu stepped forward coldly saying wanting to use the enemy's power to assist the ancient god that's truly a bold idea be can have such loyal followers it truly makes me feel pity the secret blood Transformer shouted angrily what did you say the ancient god and Bloodstone are enemies how can that be the bloodied hands continued to wrap around the secret blood Transformer but he still struggled to scream one is a flesh Transformer the other a flesh siphoner truly a match made in heaven how can they be enemies he thrashed his red eyes staring hard shouting wait you tell me clearly what is going on if not I will die with my eyes wide open y Wu pondered for a moment currently all the puzzles of this world had become clear he turned to luguna and said let's go luguna the next thing we need to do is very clear luguna slowly stepped forward that's right our first goal is to recover the fragment of the shadow of the Stars after that we must Wipe Out the secret blood cult and prevent the ancient god bared from descending ywu shook his head what you said at the beginning is correct but the last part of your thought differs from mine we're not trying to stop be from descending but rather we must help it descend lumna was immediately surprised what although you woo you often say strange things but isn't this a bit too much suddenly a voice rang out a little girl appeared behind them y woo and luguna looked towards her who is that luguna recognized the presence of the girl and murmured could this child be the younger sister of that female Captain ye W not definitely he slowly approached his tone gentle little sister don't be afraid we are also members of The Hunters Guild just like your sister she asked us to come find you you are safe now hearing that the girl immediately ran away luguna tried to call after her wait we mean no harm we just want to take you your sister both of them hurriedly chased after her Luna quickly picked up speed running while calling out wait don't run away and in front appeared a group of mutated people lingering around luguna was astonished oh my the street is full of ordinary mutated people could this be a trap Yu Stood Still calmly analyzing no if it were a trap they would have arranged for some higher level individuals not just these ordinary mutated people the group of mutated individuals began to change direction luguna wondered so shouldn't we continue to follow them yiu didn't respond immediately darting forward letun go anyway I promised for sister as a man I absolutely cannot go back on my word hearing the order luguna quickly chased after him finally they cornered the girl against the wall luguna tried to comfort her have you played enough can you come with us now your sister is still waiting for you seeing that the girl was still frightened luguna patiently persuaded don't worry we are not bad people moreover it's very dangerous for you to run around way city alone immediately the little girl used her agile skills to jump onto the large piles of stones luguna hurriedly followed but what was she really trying to do Yi Wu sighed softly her agility is not bad this child is indeed not as simple as we thought luguna frowned this child is too mischievous and strange I always feel like she is trying to lure us y wo energizing himself said then let's not spoil her fun if she wants to play hide and seek we can continue playing with her moreover there is a significant mystery about her that needs to be clarified both of them instantly took to the a ahead Luma inquired what is the biggest mystery y woo what have you discovered now Yi Wu concentrated fully to respond we have been in Ling City for a while and besides the people from The Secret blood cult we have only encountered monsters and the dead yeu eyes shown with a keen glint yet she is the only living person we have met luguna was equally surprised she is alive I thought she was also among the Dead yiu noded the emergence of a normal living person in Ling city is even more bizarre how did she manag to survive the girl suddenly stopped as she entered the center of Ling wec Yu continued so we need to ask for clarification finally both of them landed Yu looked around and asked so is this really the destination you deserted so much effort just to lead us to the center of Ling way City actually it didn't need to be so complicated our ultimate goal is also here lugumi interjected that's right you took us on such a long detour isn't that a waste of time we could have flown straight here at this point the girl spoke up those who come from afar like you still underestimate lingu City this place is protected by an elusory projection barrier which will disrupt any anyone trying to approach the castle Center you can see the castle right in front of you but as soon as you step into the barrier you will never be able to get close luguna looked at the scene before him in Surprise this is really a barrier but why didn't we notice it before Yu Stood Still observing the surroundings then explained that's because we were lucky enough to bypass the barrier only when standing inside looking out can one detect its existence Karina of the hunter Guild Praise You Are are very skilled in the past I have guided many foreign people but only two have reached this Final Destination luguna was becoming more anxious saintess saintess I have heard that the main headquarters of the hunter Guild has a saintess her status and ranks surpass all other Divine figures but I never expected her to reach an astonishing level of 200 y Wu happily approached so being a reincarnated person able to move freely within Ling way City while evad all the shadow barriers can be explained if you have lured us here you must certainly know my purpose so what is your purpose the saintes had now instantly teleported to another position my purpose is to end the hellish tragedy of Ling way City to let the land return to the Earth the dead can finally rest in peace yiu was somewhat confused if you really intend to do that then wouldn't your sister become truly dead luguna also became more serious moreover you are so powerful why not personally deal with the troubles here even if you cannot resolve it as a living person you can go to the Hunter's Guild to call for reinforcements why face all of Ling way City on your own he continued your life is full of contradictions I speak very frankly I hope the saintess Lord won't take it to heart the saintess smiled awkwardly you are really an interesting person I won't do that of course I have my own struggles the saintess quickly moved to the central door to put an end to the hellish ordeal of L y City we need to destroy the Blood Stone located at the center below this Castle she continued to explain and I or everyone in Ling YC are all secretly cursed by the secret blood cult with a high level curse this door starts to absorb mutated blood preventing us from ever approaching the center of the castle let alone leaving lingu City this high level curse even I cannot break I can only helplessly watch everyone suffer Yu step forward and touch the door when my hand was placed on it everything remained normal no an Al appeared like before the saintes questioned back so are you doubting what I said you replied be careful outside above all I do not intend to Target you please don't take it to heart he turned and asked further moreover our goal is also the Bloodstone as long as we cut off its connection to the sacrificial altar of the secret blood cult we can put an end to their control over the living and the dead right right the saintess immediately shook her head saying not enough yet your life and death are controlled by a spell generating machine in a high tower inside the castle both must be severed to break the curse Yu seem to have realized the issue got it you and your sister have helped us and we will surely help but when the time comes your sister will truly die can you really bear it the saint Tess's expression changed immediately as she said the relationship between me and her may not be as you think you would didn't want to pry further all right I won't ask too much about your family matters as long as you have the determination luguna we cannot delay letun enter the castle earlier luguna quickly followed understood the saintess said wait before entering I will grant the two of you a blessing this blessing can enhance your attributes luguna immediately became curious a blessing the blessing from the saintess Lord can we really receive it without hesitation the saintess immediately summoned a prayer Heavenly tree of Glory the world enjoys peace please heed my prayer absolve false sins and Grant protection to these two she continued use Holy Light to protect them lunu was immediately shocked with the blessing of the saintess Lord I feel much stronger ye W smiled awkwardly this blessing is indeed very powerful even I can sense a significant enhancement but for Laguna right now it is at most just a comforting effect the entire space was then enveloped by a strange atmosphere the sound of bells rang out everywhere luguna struggled to withstand the immense sound of the Bells and the Eerie pressure what is happening the saintess collapsed to the ground in pain covering her ears not good the blood cult in the city has detected our presence they are summoning all the living and the dead of Ling way City you who tried to calm down summoning the dead what does this mean the saintes shook her head her voice full of helplessness I'm not sure this situation has never occurred before could it be she paused her gaze suddenly revealing seriousness they sense the life-threatening threat so the secret blood cult even risking everything must find a way to eliminate us what is the source of this threat the saintess immediately pointed at luguna it must be because of you the overwhelming blood energy you Unleashed earlier has attracted their attention luguna was astonished really I didn't mean to the barrier was breached the saintes shouted if that's the case saintes became more serious tens of thousands of dead from Ling White City will be coming towards us luguna stood up to reassure no need to worry saintess Lord tens of thousands of dead are not scary please hide behind me and let me handle everything saintes hesitated what what her face turned bright red shy you are you an idiot tell me do you have this capability or not right now the best solution is for you all to quickly get inside the castle right the castle door is right in front of us why waste time dealing with the dead you all hurry and enter for me y wo calmly stepped inside it can't be that easy if I were the secret blood cult after the illusionary barrier was broken they would definitely set up another barrier Yu placed his hand on and sensed the barrier indeed after the Bell stopped a new magical barrier has been set up it seems there are high level experts commanding within the castle luguna shouted vwoo get out of the way let me break it Luna moved forward this magical barrier is tougher than I imagined it seems it'll take some time saintess was getting increasingly flustered right now everyone is an enemy how can you still smile at this moment what is wrong with you too the corpses had moved closer to the center a crowded prong jostling on the path it's over they're coming in fast again saintess used her powers to try to suppress them due to the curse my magic does not work on the barrier of the castle so I'm holding off these corpses you all need to think of a way to break the barrier to the castle luguna is trying harder and harder I want to hurry up too however this magical barrier is more peculiar than I thought like trying to cut through cotton my power is completely neutralized Yu had a few thoughts in his mind it seems this time the secret blood cult is launching a major offensive but the more fiercely we resist the more it proves we can capture them after thinking for a moment y Wu made a suggestion luguna stop the slashing try using blood attacks instead luguna immediately agreed all right he said and then entered an attack stance the corrosive blood created a crack in the barrier however the door still didn't budge even with the attacks it wouldn't break the crack was quickly corroded and repaired is the secret blood cult really that formidable y Wu seem to realize something no based on previous combat experience the secret blood Culp cannot possibly defeat you there must be a problem here luguna spoke increasingly flustered V woo what should we do now Yu thought for a moment and propose we must decide to use fresh blood for transformation applying absolute power to show them that against this strength any enemy will be useless don't hold back attack with full force for me upon receiving the order luguna immediately used blood Colossus starting to continuously attack the door meanwhile over here the saintess was still struggling against the undead in her heart a vague hope remained don't worry what I promised you will soon be fulfilled you will soon be liberated from this suffering ing the monsters attacked more and more fiercely but the saintess did not waver she recalled a moment from before when the survivors had looked at her with eyes full of respect look it's the saintess Lord she has come to bless us again one person in the crowd spoke up their face full of reverence saintes Lord You should also take care to rest don't exhaust yourself just from taking care of us another person chimed in their voice full of gratitude with the blessing of the saintess Lord I feel that my strange illness has improved by more than half already the sacrifices and Faith of these people warmed the saint Tess's heart more than ever but she knew she had to continue fighting she could not stop returning to the present the words of the people from before echoed in Saint's mind thank you saintess Lord I will definitely let you rest in peace and at the same time I will make the hybrid remnants of the secret blood cult pay the price suddenly a voice rang out Kina long time no see sister of humanity seeing kalia's figure approach Kina was overjoyed sister Kalia gently said you were still stubbornly immersed in the light of the saintess can't you pull yourself out I know you cared deeply for those kind-hearted people so do I if not I wouldn't have helped bury their bodies but now callia extended her hand youve done as you wished for so long it's time to pull back come here with me or else I'll be angry luguna struggled to stand exhausted I've used all my strength why is it still ineffective the expression on luguna face was one of great concern the recovery speed of the magic barrier enveloping this Castle keeps Pace with my destructive power I always feel as if it's the same kind of power that I'm using Yu heard this and began to ponder the same kind of power then it can be explained Yu presented his reasoning the secret blood cult uses the blood of the ancient god to assimilate the fragments of The Haunting Starlight the main purpose is to exploit the power of those fragments if they have truly succeeded things could become very difficult in the underground sacrificial altar at the center of the castle the members of the blood Shadow cult were trying their best one of them shouted it hurts so much I I can't hold on anymore use the blood and flesh of the sacrifice for a beautiful and unlimited future the followers Cried Out In Fear Lord to maintain this protective barrier we need to consume flesh beyond what we anticipated the great priest is still very stubborn refusing to loosen up the Gap left by the dead must be filled by the living we absolutely cannot allow Outsiders to ruin our Century loan plan another follower continued to explain but the appetite of Bloodstone was too great another person spoke up the living devotees are running low if we continue to expend resources at this rate we won't be able to hold on much longer nevertheless the great priest did not relent don't speak to me with useless words if you can't make it you should fill the Gap yourself the assimilation of Bloodstone is just one final step away there absolutely cannot be any unforeseen events on the outside lunu is still trying to break the barrier saintes Kina was extremely worried having thought this time we could finally rely on two trustworthy people but the result is still not good is it seeing this Kalia urged do you still have time to look elsewhere little sister she tried to remind her it's thanks to the protective magic that I gave you before although I'm in a state of death now at least my Consciousness is still clear isn't this a chance given to us by heaven to be together forever she angrily brandished her sword and charged towards Kina why you want to destroy this rare opportunity I know you want to take revenge for me and the people of lingy those who were killed by the secret blood cult but if you break the control then we really have to say goodbye isn't it better this way Kina tried to persuade her it's not like that sister she explained her voice filled with emotion I lost you once and I still cannot forget the grief and anger from that time my body trembles with each beat but you the one who stands before me with this Consciousness do not bring me joy in our reunion on the contrary it only makes me feel more grief and anger and what about everyone in the city Kina looked at her sister tears filling her Resolute eyes I am the saintess and I absolutely will not allow the bodies of the people to be exploited by the secret blood cult she was getting angrier and angrier why don't you understand for me capturing the lure is not important what I want is just for us to be together as long as we are Forever by each other's side Nothing Else Matters Kina couldn't control her emotions any longer I also want to be forever with you but absolutely not like this everything now is a twisted illusion I have to change all of this she was extremely Furious you foolish little sister this world is inherently fake and warped the closer you get to the leader of the Hunter's Guild the more you understand the nature of this world my Reliance on that small body and power of yours will not change anything a stream of red blood oozed from her eyes if you feel it because of life and death we cannot reach forever making you a dead person like me then we can be together forever Yu turn to look at the two sisters a duel between sisters the longer we stay with her the less control the captain will have over her Consciousness and looking at the appearance of the saintes she also won't last much longer we must immediately enter The Fortress for the saint test to escape Yu took out several vials of medicine at first he was worried because he was afraid luguna could withstand the effects of the medicine he had been reluctant to use it however now he couldn't think much more he threw the vials of medicine towards luguna come on Luna's entire body immediately underwent a transformation he felt a surge of power from within suddenly feeling so strong that he could almost fly luguna continued to move forward breaking through the barrier this exhilarating feeling was wonderful he was filled with strength that seemed inexhaustible the barrier was instantly shattered luguna stepped inside opening the door for Yu once the barrier was completely neutralized luguna looked at his achievement and felt pleased finally I can get in I will destroy this place from the inside Yi Wu squinted to observe I don't understand why this guy is acting like this could it be a side effect of the medicine at that moment the satest looked inside her eyes brimming with tears thank you take care the door immediately slammed shut before his eyes yiu pondered recalling her words what did she just say why couldn't I hear clearly he felt her words and expression seemed full of emotion something very complex like a thank you or a farewell luguna was now continuing to smash the furniture inside I've lost my patience now let's go it feels like with one hand I could crush all the scum of the secret blood cult luguna was becoming more and more frenzy call me King call me demon I must turn this place into my bloody Kingdom Yu seeing the powerful effect of the drug on luguna forced to laugh oh it seems I shouldn't do that again next time below the secret passage the followers were activating the spell generating machine I've heard that in the underground alter area there have already been quite a few deaths we're assigned here to protect this spell generating machine how fortunate we are the team leader approached admonishing in a Stern voice lazy ones you are too lazy as the most devoted followers of the ancient god being able to dedicate ourselves to it is our highest honor everyone should admire those comrades who have fallen in battle not sick here feeling secretly pleased if anyone is afraid of death they can just go and die on their own I don't want to die alongside you suddenly a loud noise echoed what was that why is the roof of the tall tower being cut off another person panicked this place has a highlevel magical barrier protecting it gu Wu and luguna advanced and as soon as they stepped into the underground altar they sent the gloomy and murderous atmosphere in the sky two figures suddenly appeared y wo on high alert shouted loudly it's an enemy Ambush Swear to protect the magic generation device concentrate fire and attack Yu's call was like a rallying cry the followers below echoed in unison fellow comrades the moment we demonstrate our worth for the God has finally arrived let's fight fight until not a single corpse remains with without hesitation luguna charged down to attack the enemy his sword was sharp and he swung it fiercely obliterating the target he coldly laughed turning to dust is not a bad way to die as luguna finished his attack his expression turned wild a frenzy filling his eyes he laughed arrogantly why did it shatter with just one hit weren't there spells supposed to be very tough behind him yeu observed thinking to himself no wonder he is anti- faction account but more corrupted the stronger it seems that only Madness and destruction can unleash the true power of the nightmare Sovereign without delay Yu flew up to support next we must find the secret passage leading to the underground altar this cannot be resolved solely through strength luguna quickly moved behind him his voice low but Resolute I will try to control my frenzy but I cannot guarantee that I will manage in the underground altar the scene was filled with sorrow and Chaos followers lay sprawled on the ground their cries echoing everywhere it hurts our blood is about to be drained dry no we can't bear it any longer our bodies have reached their limit the great priest continued to shout persevere for me you useless worthless fools as followers of the most beloved deity is this all you have in mind the flock of worshippers tried to explain we truly have given our all right now there is hardly any Flesh and Blood body left to provide for the Bloodstone the great priest displayed a fierce demeanor hardly any aren't you all still alive even if there's only one of you left you must make it for me in his heart he thought but who on Earth are those Outsiders who can disrupt the strongest defensive formation of mine fortunately the entrance to the sacrificial altar is extremely secretive Outsiders will never be able to find it suddenly a flustered worshipper rushed in no it's not good great priest the magic generator has been destroyed hearing this news the great priest was taken AB how is this possible the magic generator was hidden in one of the tall towers of the castle how could the enemy find it in such a short time immediately the altar doors were breached and someone had stormed into the underground sacrificial altar the group of worshippers surrounded the great priest to protect him the great priest immediately roared no this secret altar cannot be found why y woo calmly stepped inside don't underestimate my greed I have plenty of time to search for Treasures the great priest felt incredibly confused who are you the surrounding worshippers began to get excited fo you scared me I thought the opponent had many people turns out it's just a weakling you guys don't need to interfere just give me this fragile one for a free kill just then luguna appeared exclaiming what the hell the worshippers seemed to have been choked and luguna very excited sneered my brothers do you think you're worthy the great priest saw the bodies of the worshippers lying on the ground and became anxious that was too fast I didn't even catch a glimpse of his attack wait that outfit of his the high priest immediately shouted you are a member of the hunter Guild do you even realize what you've done in my capacity as the great priest of this congre ation I command you to kneel and plead for Mercy given your significant power the acolytes might Grant you a chance to atone by offering yourself to the deity upon hearing this luguna burst into laughter what a high position you have great priest but I'm not your dog why should I listen to you at this moment the great priest was scared dog could it be that you in the blink of an eye the great priest was brought down he struggled to heal his wounds how can he control blood how did he gain such strange powers like those of the ancient god could it be that he is one of the hunter guilds sent to kill me the great priest sneered mockingly his voice full of disdain don't joke around I have the ancient God's blessing you won't be able to kill me don't let the hunter Guild deceive you anymore they can't save the world but you can the only one who can save the world is my God blood mystery Lord be that is also why I join the secret blood cult this is my great love luguna upon hearing this chuckled lightly ha isn't it a coincidence just as I came here to destroy the world you appeared unexpectedly what did you say the great priest exclaimed in shock luguna slowly stepped forward his gaze iy of course I am not a member of the Hunter's Guild I am killing you not for a mission but for Revenge the great priest quickly retreated his voice trembling wait you hear me out there has been a misunderstanding Rio's death was not my fault not having the chance to finish his words the great priest was pierced through by a series of lances damn it his blood manipulation ability surpasses imagination my healing efficiency can't keep up with the attack speed of the blood religion lum's eyes were emotionless devoid of any feeling now I give you a chance try to remember how many times you told your subordinates to stab Rio with long Spears because today I will stab you exactly that many times s if you survive I will let you go the great priest frowned his expression suggesting he was trying to recall it was such a long time ago how could I remember clearly the lances drove deeper and deeper forcing him to no longer deny six times no wait it was seven eight times I remember now it was definitely eight you have stabbed me six times already and the other two you must not go back on your word luga's expression turns Sinister eight times let's say you're right so what do you really believe the words of someone prepared to destroy the world in this life you've truly lived in vain immediately other lances continued to pierce through the body of the great priest what you're not saying anything anymore after completing the Revenge luguna finally returned to his original form R Rio you're Master I've repaid him twice over next all I need to do is absorb this fragment of the shadow of the star and I can gain the strongest power opening the path of destruction and rebuilding at this moment luguna wanted to move closer to take the fragment but then realized the problem what the fragment not only Rejects My absorption but also actively attacks me Yi Wu spoke up to caution stay away from that fragment luguna there is something wrong with it in his heart he thought my previous hesitation is proving true this fragment of the shadow of the Stars has really been assimilated with the blood of the ancient god luguna still insisted on forcibly absorbing it this fragment not only repulses my absorption but also actively draws my blood fine let's see in the end who absorbs whom luguna cursed determined to try once more but Yu step forward to try to stop him don't act recklessly luguna don't let your current emotions mislead you the situation is still unclear we should Retreat and reassess luguna remains stubborn following his own will damn it just as the strongest power is Within Reach this situation arises I truly cannot accept it y Wu tried to reassure surely you had some understanding of this right what is going on why does The Shard reject Laguna I didn't expect Laguna's Spirit to appear like this at this moment but I can feel that this Shard truly belongs to me however it seems to have been invaded and corroded by some kind of power severing it and preventing it from merging y Wu immediately realized the issue it seems my speculation was not wrong The Shard must have been eroded by the blood of the ancient godbe becoming uncontrollable if we want to merge The Shard we must neutralize the effects of its blood power if Laguna continues to lose control what are we waiting for letun go resolve this now he looked around and continued the headquarters of the secret blood cult must be underground in this Castle I will smash this place there's no way we won't find it Yu scan the surroundings and frowned that's not right the environment around this altar doesn't seem like it has hidden passages the spirit immediately suggested laguma you can try touching The Shard again using the blood vessels spread throughout the ground of The Shard to sense the environment and the Life Energy however you will have to endure the pain caused by the shards attack Laguna said fiercely compared to my rage Laguna directly thrust his hand in this little pain is nothing the atmosphere outside immediately changed he gradually sensed something strange it seemed that a heartbeat echoed wait why is this happening in the entire lingu city besides me and Yu there can only be one life force detectable Yu offered a hypothesis that unique life must be Kina this proves that besides those who are performing the sacrificial ritual there are no other members of The Secret blood cult in Ling way City suddenly Laguna realized something wait does this mean that young lady Christina is also dead Laguna began to go mad damn it even if I have to dig the ground I will definitely unearth that bastard of the secret blood cult and crush him to death although this thought was somewhat unintentional the truth is that Christina's death was already destined compared to her this pain is nothing Yi Wu contemplated for a long time and then said I am more concerned about the strangeness of this secret blood cult theoretically their headquarters must be in Ling way City but this scale is far too small compared to expectations so what are they really hiding in where it's a Pity that the dead cannot speak the truth if only we could capture a dying cultist and ask him the open space gate has emerged the ceiling has opened and dark tentacles begin to rush in seemingly wanting to seize the fragments Laguna struggles to stand guard his anger boiling but with no Outlet to vent he Roars watch me tear you apart just then Yu suddenly intervenes wait Laguna these tentacles can lead us to the headquarters of the secret blood cult lagona surprise responds what Yu immediately flies up high explaining as he goes before we made a mistake by thinking habitually we always assumed that the headquarters of the secret blood cult was underground but perhaps they are in a place we never imagined Laguna quickly follows a place we never imagined both look toward the retreating tentacles they are descending from the sky completely contrary to their initial expectations Yi Wu firmly asserts that's right the headquarters of the secret blood cult could be in the sky Laguna suddenly notices something new y woo look over there there are two other tentacles they seem to be wrapping something and pulling it up to the sky Yi Wu glances over and sees the figures of two people being pulled up he exclaims it's Christina and father great they are still alive Laguna breeds a sigh of relief I couldn't sense them earlier probably because they were being pulled up by the tentacles out of the range of Ling way City Laguna Smiles lightly his anger now transformed into determination let's go we must rescue them y Wu spoke to stop wait don't step into the forest carelessly let's go over there and take a look first before we talk dark clouds gradually spread across the sky lagona flying behind asked could this really be the headquarters of the secret blood cult a blood red flying ship suddenly appeared yiu observed it carefully and concluded hidden in the dark clouds above Lango City no wondered no one has detected it he stared for a while sighed this is indeed beyond my expectations the technology in this world has reached such a level Laguna witnessing the scene before him couldn't hide his astonishment it's a flying ship I've heard that only the royal family possesses one and it requires an enormous amount of resources to build does this secret blood cult really have one how surprising the two continued to observe Laguna wanted to enter yiu said the fragments and young lady Christina have been taken by the tentacles into different sections of the flying ship now that we know the location of the secret blood cult we no longer need to avoid them Laguna nodded but still looked skeptical yiu urged him Laguna let go let's destroy it but remember to keep the core of the flying ship upon hearing this Laguna immediately became excited great I've been holding back for so long finally I can vent my feelings alert system warning warning enemy Ambush detected initiating automatic defense mechanism on the ship all Firepower was activated to attack lagona nimbly dodged extremely excited exited at the prospect of battle he shouted loudly is that all the Firepower you have not enough to get me excited Laguna charged forward slicing through the tentacles around him commanding his subordinates destroy them all for me meanwhile the members of The Secret blood cult were chanting incantations even at the cost of sacrificing the underground altar Branch they had no regrets they knew their efforts would not be in vain the Bloodstone had been fully nurtured Cindy Roda stood at the Forefront beginning to use the summoning technique as she waved her hand the space seemed to be crushed she proclaimed welcome our God the dark blood secret Lord the great and Majestic beard immediately Sydney Roa ordered open the top door of the flying ship release the energy of the Bloodstone the subordinates responded in unison yes from the void a myriad of tentacles extended forth the members of The Secret blood cult having prepared pred for over a 100 years were now incredibly excited they cheered our God is finally descending the scene was truly magnificent they felt honored to witness the posture of the ancient God's descent with the blood of the God and all the flesh and blood in Ling way City they had nurtured the Bloodstone without any rejection from the ancient god this time the God will surely descend the progress of the Divine descent reached 5% Sydney roel was extremely worried the pace was still too slow and he understood that it was urgent to complete it before the energy from the Bloodstone ran out he ordered immediately activate the anti-gravity energy link and accelerate the Divine descent process a subordinate spoke up to a pose my Lord everything is still stable at the moment why take the risk to accelerate if we do so the flying ship may very well collapse under the immense energy pressure Cindy rogot was unfazed his gaze Resolute my command is the divine decree who dares to doubt as soon as the words left his mouth his cold glare silenced any opposition from his subordinates they all responded in unison yes my Lord it seemed that Cindy Roga was still lost in a state of fanaticism he continued his voice filled with determination this is the last chance for the Divine descent no mistakes are allowed we must dedicate everything to the deity the subordinates echoed loudly dedicate everything to the deity dedicate everything to the deity at this moment Ling White City appeared to be engulfed in flames the progress of the Divine descent had reached 10% the anti-gravity energy link was unofficially activated Cindy RIS shouted finally it's beginning accelerate accelerate a series of tentacles emerged from the void tearing apart the air around them the Divine descent process quickly increased to 20% Cindy rogo was still not satisfied ified not enough still not enough he shouted his voice urgent increase the power transmission capacity quickly accelerate The Descent of the god the current progress is only 45% a violent shock occurred the computer's voice rang Out full of warnings warning the power transmission capacity has exceeded its limit the power transmission capacity has exceeded its limit ignoring the warnings Cindy Roga remains stubborn he shouted loudly continue increase the power faster faster faster warning cut the ground energy link cut the ground energy Link at this moment his body gradually began to materialize but The Descent of the God only reached 85% Cindy Roa looked at the situation and roared no it can't be like this the plan we have been preparing for over a 100 years is it really going to be destroyed at the space gate the body of the ancient god was stuck tight a mocking voice rang out from the other side hey I also consider myself to have seen the world but this situation is truly a first experience indeed this is a perfect Testament to the mechanization of divinity ywu and Laguna were still intently observing their eyes fixed on the beast in its current desperate State the Beast struggled but to little effect YW sighed and spoke your thing is not very reliable the Majesty of the ancient God has been completely lost because of you Laguna glanced over and replied the duration of the side effects of the drug is too short you need to find a way to dispel it quickly he nodded in distress and immediately went to handle this situation meanwhile Laguna returned to her original state her expression pensive she unexpectedly remarked I didn't expect the secret blood Culp to be so powerful to reach this level they must have accumulated and arranged for hundreds of years however even so we cannot allow the ancient God to descend easily hearing this yeu frowned and asked so what should we do next we need to take action immediately Laguna replied her face still worried the energy of the fragment is being depleted regardless of whether you want to help the ancient god descend or destroy it you must be quick otherwise everything will become useless ye W silently considered and ultimately decided to summon the system he spokes system can I use the magic Crystal to summon the ancient god in this world the system responded in a cold voice the progress of the m mission exceeds 30% the summoning type magic Crystal can be used normally hearing this Yu breeded the sigh of relief telling himself that's good then he immediately summoned the eye of the ancient god Len to appear come forth big eye Laguna below was extremely frightened is that an ancient god up in the sky questions continue to arise from The Souls why is there a second ancient god in this world isn't be's God the only deity why does it descends so easily while be's God faces such difficulty what does this ancient god want by appearing now one person in the crowd exclaimed no I feel my faith is about to collapse at this moment Yu slowly stepped forward he shouted you secret blood cult truly embarrass yourselves wasting over a hundred years Cindy Roda upon seeing ywo trembled he pressed on what do you actually want in his heart a whirlwind of questions spiraled is this second God's child summoned out by that kid what kind of divine being is he that he can easily summon an ancient god all by himself y Wu immediately commanded Len big ey you have the ability to tear the dimensional space help the Beast successfully descend with you that must be easy right at that moment the entire space began to twist and raging winds blew fiercely the crowd became excited look the dimensional Rift is being torn open this is the work of another ancient god could it be Loi immediately retracted its power causing the entire dimensional space to shatter instantly it is helping us as soon as the Beast completed its descent the people below began to express their admiration what is beauty what is strength is this the dark blood secret Lord Beed of wuan a voice shouted out praise God worship God the worshippers went wild one person shouted I can feel it I can feel it the power of the god is Flowing within me the God and we are all praising God worshiping God the noise was incessant y Wu Laguna stood inside the barrier talking to each other I feel powerless all over Yu said not only the people of the secret blood cult but even we protected by the eye demon cannot escape the influence of the ancient God's power the moment the Beast descended the blood in all our bodies mutated our blood circulation slowed down causing me pain and leaving me without strength Laguna nodded continuously pounding his chest as he spoke the blood circulation of the secret blood cult members has accelerated making them breastless and frenzy as long as there is blood circulation in the body it is affected by the power of the dark blood's secret Lord even I cannot Escape it Yu embraced his aching body his voice filled with worry such a strange power this really is hard to deal with the group of church members was immediately crushed what is happening here Cindy Roda felt the blood in her body boiling then suddenly exploding from within in front of that scene she became even more excited don't be afraid this is the deity granting US Supreme power hold on as long as we can absorb this source of energy the entire world will be at our feet so let your body and spirit relax feel grateful however the group of ritualists exploded one by one in pain Cindy Roga finally realized the truth this is not a blessing from the deity we are your most loyal Believers everything we do is for you why why do you treat us this way be laughed loudly his tone full of mockery a bunch of stupid insects you dare to ask for blessings you used the power of the shadow of the Stars to make me suffer so much the fact that you die intact is already the greatest favor I grant you Cindy Roa cried her voice choked no we are your most loyal Believers having devoted Over a century and countless human lives to welcome your descent although the process was difficult and prolonged at least you succeeded in descending even if we have no merit we have toiled then why you want to punish us be continued to Roar 100 years so what in my eyes it's just a blink of an eye basically not worth mentioning sinin Roda fell into a frenzy praise God worship God the deity is always right no no we have been abandoned by the deity our faith is wrong kill the deity destroy the deity damn it how could I doubt the deity no the one at fault is the deity it is the deity who has betrayed us kill him he is not our God the leader of the church was now completely in a state of depravity continuously shouting blasphemy blasphemy truly Blasphemous even if he is a God he cannot blaspheme against our beliefs that damn God be lightly flew up easily evading the attack he smiled faintly useless trash even the struggle before death is So Weak and Powerless at this moment Laguna and Dee Halal appeared before be Laguna looked at him his voice full of surprise I am quite surprised you can actually control my kind though you are just a lowly being without you I would not have been able to descend successfully Laguna continued you have the qualifications to become my subordinate Neel and pay homage to me the contract of servitude will be fulfilled ye wmed and said become your subordinate no no helping you descend is just as smoothly make you my little brother be was surprised to hear that his eyes widened what immediately after he returned to a frenzied State roaring haha the tiny Humanity dares to speak such arrogant words don't you value the path to survival I have left you humans have truly never disappointed me yiu Shrugged appearing calm it's fine as long as there's fresh blood flowing in your body you are not useless at all Laguna immediately charged forward from behind to assist in the attack be sneered oh really the blood in your body makes me crave it ba hesitated slightly upon seeing Laguna you possess the power of the shadow of the Stars within you but that power is still extremely weak Laguna didn't say more and continued to attack furiously think whoever is stronger just fight and you'll find out Laguna shouted loudly beard laughed coldly his red eyes gleaming with cruelty you were the source of all misfortunes killing you is my only chance to start over Yu curled his lip you're not to be underestimated either but it's truly interesting strong as we are we still can't escape the bindings of Fate but you you're still not strong enough and I am not at my Peak either fighting like this isn't fun at all he suddenly shifted his attention his eyes lighting up I sense a large number of life forms over there is that the Royal City of this country then let's start from there bear roared like a wild beast hurry up and think of a you become stronger kid after that we will take this world as our Arena and Slaughter to our heart's content haha bear laughed loudly then immediately flew away before leaving he said for now I will spare your lives YW watched be's retreating figure feeling confused inside he murmured oh no this guy has a very strange blood control ability don't say that mere humans like us even the OD demon before was clearly controlled by him Yu flew straight up towards the Airship continuing to think if I summon another ancient god and end up being controlled by him in return it would be a loss this guy is more Troublesome than I thought it seems that the only one who can emerge victorious in the end is Laguna he paused his gaze becoming Resolute in this timeline I still have to go through it myself Laguna was standing still inside as if waiting for something Yu continued to analyze although I can withstand BET's bizarre blood control ability my strength is much weaker than his nevertheless this is the only hope I must absorb energy from the fragments to have a chance of winning yiu spoke up to advise but his heart was still full of doubts after the disturbances caused by the secret blood cul lefor how much power is left in the remaining fragments lagona continued to strive to absorb the fragments no matter how much was left he had to absorb it after that he would head to the Royal City to stop bared rest assured he reassured himself there is still plenty of power enough to defeat be but suddenly the sound of footsteps echoed Laguna was startled and turned around who is there a cold voice rang out I am the father of young lady Christina Laguna was astonished a fragment of spirit has appeared those are the star Shadows but there is no one truly in control of Consciousness based on what you think you can absorb me the voice laughed coldly only a strong Consciousness is worthy of power a weak Consciousness like yours is ready to be absorbed by me ignoring the words Laguna ran forward I don't care who you are but if you dare to control young lady Christina I will kill you just at that moment Yi Wu rushed forward to stop Laguna don't worry Laguna he said his tone filled with caution the situation is a bit strange don't get agitated in Yu's mind you was pondering how can a fragment manifest independent Consciousness this really goes beyond my expectations it must be clarified he will immediately step forward he asked his voice Resolute even if you have Consciousness you are still useless you do not adhere to con rules and have been eroded by the blood of the ancient god ultimately you remain merely a fragment no matter how great your power your Consciousness remains weak the shattered Spirit immediately replied haha you think you can anger me and extract words from me at the same time a tiny little ant like you your courage and intelligence are truly commendable he immediately concealed his attitude but then laughed ha interesting you are far more interesting than I imagined on the outside you seem weak but your strength is beyond measure you learn to be my puppet better than anyone else suddenly that Spirit transformed into another entity it seemed he developed an independent Consciousness perhaps due to absorbing a large amount of flesh and blood from the ancient god but as ye Wu once said although his power was incredibly strong his Consciousness was extremely weak just cutting the connection between him and the two puppets would lead to victory at that moment the person on the other side continued to interfere hey hey hey don't act like you're the dominant Consciousness it really makes one want to get angry Christina and the father immediately felt the pain that shattered Spirit began to act then let use our puppets to decide who will be the final winner to seize the dominant Consciousness Yu looked at the two in front of him and calmly said the goal is clear now it's your turn to take action Laguna ye woo at the back supported young lady Christina father both of you quickly wake up you are both experts who have fought in hundreds of battles don't easily let yourselves be taken over like this the spirit on this side was still desperately trying to assist stop doing meaningless things their bodies and Consciousness have been completely taken over by the power of the fragment it can't be separated any longer the only way to free them is to kill them why haven't you attacked yet the higher their integration the more dangerous we are y was also very anxious at this moment Laguna slightly shook his head and responded I understand your thoughts if it were a different situation I would support it but now the ancient God has descended this country this world everyone one is facing a catastrophe of Extinction we no longer have time you must quickly absorb the power of the fragment before the ancient god destroys everything if someone else does it this destruction and rebirth will have no meaning at all Laguna is still struggling with his thoughts he lowered his head his voice heavy I understand everything you say but I cannot take action the image of Christina keeps appearing in my mind I am the one who promised to protect her for Life immediately a decisive slash was brought down Laguna recalled his childhood when he was training in martial arts why why won't they let me join the hunter Guild everyone has their prejudices against me it's so annoying suddenly a voice came from behind if you want to join the hunter Guild just knowing how to chop wood won't do anything Christina appeared radiant like a beam of light she was already at level 90 moreover she was incredibly beautiful who is she nevertheless Laguna instantly turned away even though her level was much higher than mine she doesn't understand belief is the most important thing don't think that my current low level means anything as long as I have faith I will grow stronger soon I will become the strongest Hunter at this decisive moment Laguna still tormented himself but the ignorant fools in the hunter Guild couldn't care less about that Faith furthermore they kept mocking me truly despicable it couldn't possibly be more Despicable suddenly Christina spoke softly her tone comforting if the hunter Guild is filled with nothing but ignorant Scoundrels why do you still want to join Laguna's entire body trembled of course because he had just returned his face full of determination joining the Hunter's Guild is my lifelong dream even if there are parasites within the guild as long as I am strong enough I will cleanse them out hearing these words Christina could not help but be surprised a young man like him already had such Grand Ambitions how interesting Laguna immediately turned away his face showing signs of embarrassment I really got carried away with my anger I said such things to someone unrelated you basically wouldn't understand from behind the subordinates stepped forward Commander Christina we should set off now Laguna heard this and fell backward in shock his eyes wide I you you're the commander of the hunter Guild Christina radiated an air of Integrity your name is Laguna right I will remember the words you said today I will wait for you with the hunter Guild and also look forward to the day you become the strongest Hunter Laguna's face turned red feeling shy there are such beautiful and kind people in this world he stepped forward grasped Christina's hand tightly his eyes filled with determination so if I become the strongest Hunter can I protect you for a lifetime at this moment lagumu was fighting with Christina I know very well what is most important right now but I cannot bring myself to harm her Christina young lady Laguna's face Twisted clearly showing his distress Christina has been my only motivation and hope over the past years now asking me to kill her this is beyond my strength seeing that scene Yi Wu also pondered Laguna I understand your suffering I do not wish to force you but this is your destiny for me and above all for yourself you must step into the abyss if you cannot make a resolution then let me help you please forgive my selfishness ye wo immediately summon the ancient god come forth greed grander finally appeared greed grander ready at the kingk command ye wo ordered his gaze directed at Laguna you shall influence his mind to amplify the Greed for power within him grander accepted the command and laughed full of Interest haha my king is not ordinary all summing me for the first time and already assigning me such a challenging task this boy Luna is very strong but his mind has weakened significantly and is collapsing however to affect him I must use my ultimate move amidst the inner conflicts and power struggles the battle continued to escalate into a more intense phase than ever grander immediately used the technique nine-headed serpent of greed but still spoke with a respectful tone by the order of the The Demon King I dare not disobey as for the summoning using my power only requires payment this time I will give the king a discount it could have been free but the contract is above all I hope you understand my king the serpent slowly Slither into Laguna's body the nine heads symbolize the strongest desires whoever was hit by this technique would have their Ambitions Amplified to the extreme surpassing all other emotions Lumin began to feel the change he troubled against the surging feelings within him power why is my thirst for power stronger than before it's becoming increasingly difficult to control that's right I should pursue power power is more important than anything only with true power can I change and hold on to everything the power I desire I must have the spirit fragment within Laguna grew stronger by the moment a voice echoed in his mind oh so you're finally reaching your limit if so let me accompany you a bit further after that you will become a part of me Christina suddenly charged in her gaze Sharp As Ice she struck straight at Laguna's body her decisive voice ringing out one strike and we shall consider ourselves even Christina's sharp sword cut a powerful line the opponent couldn't react in time and in that moment everything seemed to pause lagona seemed to be under control once your smile saved my life but now you were killing me perhaps you are being controlled to do such things however in the end it is because you are too weak in this world strength is the most important thing Laguna held Christina tightly breaking everything if I want to become the strongest I must let go of the past including you Laguna tried to hold back his tears but couldn't goodbye Captain Christina instantly Christina was submerged in a large pool of blood afterwards Laguna continued to forcibly absorb The Shard of crystal why a voice echoed from the spirit fragment why did you change so suddenly you completely become someone else where had your weak Consciousness gone wasn't there a strong bond between you how could you act like this it's impossible the spirit fragment seemed unable to accept this reality wait you have won I am willing to become your power I just asked you to return to me a bit of Consciousness I have struggled hard to gain my Consciousness and I do not want to lose it in vein like this out of respect for our past Alliance please give me a chance at this moment Laguna resembles a person wielding supreme power the weak Unworthy of having their own Consciousness are suffering the consciousness of the fragment seems to be in unbearable pain you on the fragment are now faded leaving only a resonating scream everything gradually sinks the remaining Consciousness I do not want to lose my Consciousness I do not want to return to the silent Darkness all sources of strength are flowing into Laguna's body strength is this the sensation of possessing boundless power at last I have obtained the strongest power laguma begins to unleash Rio Christina I will not let you down this world is ruled by me for you the progress of the main task has reached 50% the system announces the host is returning to the enforced timeline the remaining time is 20 days at headquarters yiu is finally returned to the real World in each world the fate of each person is different but regardless of whether it is a happy end or a bad end whether it is righteous or villainous only supreme power can control one's fate ywu is filled with contemplation the enforced system wants me to complete the Shadow King but what is the true purpose of this world line certainly it is not simply to Traverse the timeline ones forget it I shouldn't think about things that cannot be grasped right now currently there are more important things things to do he turned and stepped into the command chamber according to Priority next the first thing to do is to fully accelerate the construction of the second safety zone repair the safety walls in a wide area and complete the construction of essential basic equipment in large areas like highways furthermore it is known that the east region has the existence of two ancient gods I also need to think of a way to take them but now is not the time to take the initiative to strike I will kill their people the leaders of the east region will definitely Focus their strength against me so we also have to prepare good defenses for several waves of attacks system notification moai requests to talk to you the connection on the other end was established and M asked V woo you need to come to the headquarters Han Mo someone wants to meet you Yu was a bit puzzled who wants to meet me Moi n was very serious who else could it be it must be a woman who told you to be so popular yiu froze upon hearing this the words sounded increasingly uneasy at this moment at the headquarters Han Mo suai had just entered and rushed to HUB y Wu saying V wo I missed you so much Yu asked in confusion suai why are you here suai still hugging Yu said of course I'm here specifically to find you it's been so long since we met and it seems you've gotten stronger mokai saw this and turned to teas mokai as expected of my sister who has experienced life facing this situation and still keeping calm is truly impressive if you're going to act then act otherwise the prey might be snatched away by someone else and you'll regret it for a lifetime m n silkily turned away and replied shut up seeing the situation wasn't good Moi hurriedly comforted her don't get worked up don't get worked up I'm just reminding you hid Z long step forward and spoke up since everyone already knows each other I won't need to introduce anyone further after saying that he snapped his fingers the system inside immediately announced the activation of the defense elevator open the soundproof barrier transforming the room into a secure and private space yiu felt confused and stepped forward to ask what's going on why is there such strict defense and soundproofing Hy Zen long pointed ahead and answered of course there's a significant figure wanting to meet you let me introduce her first this is Hua yui the deputy director of angels realm group one of the five major powers in the east region she oversees the culture and entertainment for this entire area zulai the gifted singer you heard of is one of her prodiges you could say that most of the renowned artists in this region belong to her agency her connections are so extensive that it wouldn't be wrong to say she has ears and eyes everywhere ha are y y looked at ha zun long smiled and said long you flatter me too much don't let the young people misunderstand entertainment culture really doesn't have any practical effect in this apocalypse it's merely a place to express feelings Yi Wu unexpectedly spoke up on the contrary in an apocalypse like this we need things of spiritual value even more entertainment culture is not only a balm for the soul but also an indispensable industry who are you ye smiled in response you you are quite an interesting young man you are y woo right indeed the name carries weight I have long wanted to thank you for the matter with l n last time but I never had the chance I think expressing my gratitude in person is the best way to show my sincerity finally I get to meet you Yu stepped forward shook hands with Kua yui and said it's just a small matter so you don't need toart sister who are you so the person Kai wanted me to meet was you Moki immediately turned to tease m n when did he start calling you ke I didn't know that m n blushed and shyly replied shut up no one sees you as food y Wu then turned to H Yu y and asked so you are the one from the east region looking for me it must be about woen Shu and Juku right who are you y looked at him in Surprise and replied you have such an indifferent attitude towards a big matter like killing Wu win Shu and Juku she said no wonder you are who you are that's right I'm here because of this matter it's not for nothing that I voted against when the leaders of the east region held a vote on whether to kill you or not at this moment those around suddenly realized they exclaimed in Surprise what the leaders of the east region want to kill y wo such a big issue has happened y woo you must be careful and take precautions we will definitely stand behind you hide zun long stepped forward to pay respect to HOA UI and said thank you for personally coming to inform us and for clearly stating your position this helps us come up with more appropriate counter measures whoi replied this matter is not yet at a critical point although the east region has issued a warrant for yiu the other major Powers have not yet prioritized the level of danger he represents after all since the safe Zone was established over a hundred years ago many talents have emerged but but most have either been defeated by the east region or killed for them this kind of thing has become too familiar I Stand By Your Side for two reasons firstly to return a favor to you although La opposing vote had no practical effect it at least clearly shows my stance towards you secondly consider it an investment if you can indeed defeat the east region and cause the other major powers to collapse then I will greatly benefit she said of course if your abilities are insufficient and you end up being defeated by the east region I won't suffer any losses I will only assist you under the condition of not revealing my identity ultimately whether you succeed or not depends on you I only hope you understand that my nature is that of a merchant always pursuing the greatest profit you looked towards HOA Yu y and replied this is very normal I don't resent schemes and moreover having an Insider at the heart of the enemy's internal structure like you makes my work much more convenient who are you ye smile then I can rest assured my father truly did not misjudge you at this moment Moi suddenly spoke up wait ye woo are you really planning to confront the east region I don't mean to belittle you but the internal strength of the east region is definitely not as simple as you think not to mention their hundreds of years of entrepreneurial history is built on cunning and ruthlessness just their abundant capital and advanced technology make it difficult for other major powers to compare you absolutely cannot bring down the east region Yu cly looked at Moi and replied I never said I wanted to take action immediately this needs to be arranged and we can bit by bit over a long time but right now the first thing I need to do is accelerate the construction of the super safe Zone who are you y asked in confusion super safe Zone really y Wu nodded and continued my plan for building the super safe zone is roughly like this although there are many challenges I believe it can definitely be accomplished who are you ye smiled I underestimated you I didn't expect you to have such Grand plans and ambition it seems that even if the east region does not actively provoke a conflict with you sooner or later you will have ideas about that area choosing to Stand By Your Side was indeed the right decision suai hugg y Wu and happily said once your second safe zone is completed I will definitely hold the largest live show there Yi Wu smiled in response sure welcome who are you ye then took out a card handed it to yiu and said here is a level three pass ID for the east region you can use this when you want to go there Yu accepted it and replied thank you but there's no need I already have this saying that he pulled out another card from his pocket who Yi was taken a back upon seeing it that is a level one ID pass only Associates like me in the east region have that where did you get this suai sadly chimed in oh so fast it's so hard to meet Yu I still want to yiwu chuckled softly and said nothing more y Wu smiled and explained to put it simply I have harmonized the ID of woo when Shu and Juku made some modifications to obtain this ID before leaving who will you ye turn back and said with a faint smile you could even harmonize and upgrade a low-level ID to a high level well I guess Ang shallow then we will take our leave now suai waved goodbye to Yu and added you must wait for me to open the Liv stream of the deep house as soon as they left who are you ye thought to himself in the past 100 years countless people have trying to overthrow the east region but all have inevitably become lost souls how far can ye woo maintain this can he create history it really makes me a bit expectant in the meeting room yiu hesitated for a moment before speaking so The Grudge between me and the east region definitely cannot be resolved as soon as he finished speaking the Rune was in an uproar everyone began to worry oh my is he really going to declare war on the east region so soon I fear we are not their match Wan how unlike the crowd Was Not Afraid at all he laughed loudly what is there to fear if the people from the east region want to come and cause trouble let them come Yu business is my business like sing sitting beside agreed this is indeed a bit difficult to resolve but we have nothing to fear anyway we will have to go to war sooner or later danl more cautiously spoke up while we don't need to avoid combat everything needs to be calculated carefully at that moment Yin Guan interjected she stood up with her hands on the table her reaction a bit intense ye woo the enemy could strike at any time to ensure safety it's best to protect you 24 hours a day as soon as she finished speaking Juan how teased protect for 24 hours huh are you saying you want to serve him even while he is bathing or sleeping your intentions are quite clear haha moreover with Yu's abilities does he really need our protection realizing that her reaction was a bit excessive Yin huan sat down embarrassed and said I I spoke out of turn G Wang Chun then slowly spoke up interrupting the conversation I don't need to pour cold water on everyone's Spirits even though our ranks have increased significantly compared to before even to the point where we can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the top teams in the east region our overall strength still lags far behind now is not the right time to engage in direct combat saying this he turned to yiu and asked vwu you don't plan to directly declare war on the east region right now to you just as he thought Yu replied seriously um now is not the time to declare war right now this is just a personal Grudge between me and the east region they are only targeting me today I called everyone here to inform you next I will expedite the specific plan for building a super safe Zone after speaking he immediately used a panoramic projector to make it easier for everyone to visualize the terrain of that area when the scene was displayed everyone was astonished the branching tree structure throughout the safe Zone looks like a highway Network a highway why a highway are you really planning to not letting everyone doubt for long yiu quickly explained there is an ancient saying to get rich one must repair the roads I intend to build a highway system linking the two main safe zones then from there smaller branches will spread out to connect all areas inside this will link the scattered areas and the wild tribes creating a unified hole as soon as y Wu finished speaking Moi immediately stood up and said vwo I unconditionally support any decision you make but if you really want to build a highway there are some important issues you need to pay attention to I need to remind you in advance M Kei analyzed that first of all the distance between the two safe zones is too far and repairing the road would be a major project that requires a lot of effort even if we do not spare Manpower and Financial Resources this is not a project that can be completed in a short time next Savage beasts roam the Wilderness and the terrain is complex and currently we do not have the conditions to repair the road even if we manage to complete the repairs the road will quickly be destroyed maintenance and repairs afterward will face many difficulties Moi continued the biggest difficulty lies in the issue of human nature the concentrated zones and wild tribes along with the wandering mercenaries in the wilderness all fight for themselves and have no good intentions moreover decades AO go the safe Zone spent a large sum of money to build a road to the nearest wild disease station however the result was that the road was targeted by wild forces and became a target for plundering in the end it was left abandoned and no one thought about repairing it anymore upon hearing this everyone became more worried Hy Zen long immediately asked Li jasai with the current strength and construction ability of the HMO group can we overcome the technical difficulties in repairing this road liai furrowed his prow and replied the act of repairing the road itself is not a technical issue the real challenge lies in maintenance and post prevention as Master M has mentioned after all the two safe zones are more than a thousand kilm apart not to mention the fact that a substantial amount of capital would need to be invested the bigger question is how much can be recovered but if yiu has proposed such a plan I believe he has calculated it thoroughly at that moment ymu finally spoke up he smiled slightly his voice full of confidence that's right any investment must aim at optimizing the capital recovery ratio repairing the road May consume a lot of resources but the benefits received will be long lasting First Once the main highway is repaired the travel time between the two saake zones which used to be over 50 hours will be reduced to just 5 hours his words left everyone astonished what only 5 hours the time is shortened by 10 times if we use high-speed transportation wouldn't the time be reduced even further y Wu nodded continuing to affirm exactly only in this way can the two safe zones truly be linked together as for defense I divide it into two types passive defense and active defense firstly I will build defensive towers and fortifications utilizing self-sustaining energy to ensure passive defense active defense will focus on launching proactive strikes eliminating all wild beast strongholds within the super Sav zones and wild dungeons the goal is to transform the entire Wilderness Area into territory under our control Yu hesitated a bit when mentioning the issue of humanity which he found the most bothersome he asked mque how has the situation progressed regarding the scattered forces in the wilderness that I asked you to persuade earlier on the other side of the screen M confidently replied I'm working on it boss you can rest assured within the scope of the super safe Zone you plan almost all the scattered forces have agreed not only have they accepted but they are also very supportive M's words left the entire room in a state of astonishment in just a few short minutes everyone transitioned from one surprise to another Juan how was the first to speak up what they've all agreed these are the scattered forces in the wilderness that have been around for over a hundred years Moi was equally shocked he turned to Y Wu and asked did you arrange everything in advance this is really having it in the palm of your hand a decisive Victory from thousands of miles away right before you woo could respond Hy Zone long spoke up no one has managed to unify the Wilderness around the safe zone for over a hundred years y woo you truly never cease to amaze me Yin hu couldn't hide her admiration either she clasped her hands gently and said why woo you really are very reliable onean how noticing the Ian guan's reaction seized the opportunity to tease look at that the proud tone is no different from complimenting her man unexpectedly his words infuriated Yin Hanan she Reed her eyes rushed over and struck him hard in the face then plaintively said what nonsense are you talking about Juan how quickly admitted his mistake I was wrong at that moment M cantly spoke up from across the room boss actually there's a small issue there is a for that has always refused to negotiate with me that is the chaos Abyss his statement left everyone stunned the chaos Abyss that is not a small issue G1 cheu deide him unfazed explained the chaos Abyss is the second largest power in the southwest Wasteland only behind Wu they have a large number of people but lack discipline all are brutal and violent individuals mayi continued that's right that's right it is them I have received very important intelligence the chaos Abyss is secretly mobilizing preparing to attack Infiniti City no more precisely the second safe Zone in the Southwest is under construction hearing this Yu said seriously is that so I understand you've worked hard during this time youve given me a very big surprise and I won't treat you poorly as for the chaos Abyss they don't want to cooperate with me forget it to show my sincerity I will person Al go greet them at the chaos Abyss the atmosphere was extremely chaotic a leader stood among his subordinates raised his wine glass and laugh loudly ha now the defenses of Infiniti City are empty our opportunity has come as long as we take down Infinity City everything inside will belong to us Brothers drink up drink heartily to have strength for The Siege drink wildly so that after breaking the city we can attack fiercely haha steal steal land steal women we must seize Infinity City suddenly he stopped staring into the distance and murmuring huh am I seeing things from drinking too much why does it seem that something is approaching from afar he turned to his subordinate and shouted damn it you with the spy glass quickly take a look the subordinate hurriedly raised the spy glass looked closely for a while then said boss I'm looking now um it seems like the people of Yi Wu he was startled and exclaimed these guys want to die do they dare to intrude into our territory in the conference room the atmosphere became tense a subordinate stood up and reported our Scouts have investigated thoroughly Infinity city is currently being rebuilt but the person in charge is just a young girl now is the time when the city's defenses are weakest another person spoke up looking worried but Infinity city has been taken over by the hanmo group if we had attack won't we incur their wrath everyone went silent for a moment then the leader laughed loudly again haha what about hanm Mo we do it quickly and efficiently take Infinity City and then disappear by then who'll be able to find us one of the others immediately mocked look at you why are you afraid taking Infinity City definitely brings more benefits than harm previously Han Mo fought with home chin and got injured now is our opportunity at this moment the leader Hassan was sitting above pondering over them around him there were quite a few girls serving him one girl with purple hair accidentally spilled water from the cup seeing that she quickly knelt down stammering I I'm sorry leader I didn't mean to I beg you to forgive me I will clean it up immediately Hassan did not show any anger he just leaned down reaching out to caress her frightened face no need it's fine he said softly hearing that the girl raised her head her voice trembling L leader before she could finish her sentence Hassen forcefully Twisted her neck you can go die a useless thing like you can't even do a little thing right so there's no value in living anymore after saying that he mercilessly tossed her body aside then crossed his legs and ordered listen carefully I want to take Infinity City at all costs as long as we quickly occupy it and establish defenses immediately then hanm won't be able to react in time after all I am closer to Infinity city after hearing the story Hassan scoffed and let out a snort mque you dare to convince me with someone named Yu how ridiculous the fact that I didn't kill him on the spot is already showing him respect and Y woo if he has the guts to come here and force me to submit I will kill him and feed him to the dogs one of the subordinates nearby spoke up to remind him leader it is said that y Wu personally took care of Wu G upon hearing this Hassen laughed loudly filled with mockery you guys use your heads to think about it how could this be possible he could take down Wu Jay by himself he is just a pawn that Han Mo put out as a shield I say it plainly if y Wu dares to show up in front of me he won't live for even a second no sooner had he finished speaking than the room suddenly shook violently the subordinates looked around in panic unable to comprehend what was happening suddenly someone rushed in from outside their face pale leader not good we're being attacked Hassen slammed his fist on the table in anger and roared damn it such audacity to DARE attack us our team has more than 3,000 men what scale does the enemy have to DARE do this the atmosphere in the room became more tense than ever All Eyes turned to Hassan waiting for his command the man stuttered an answer 77 people the opposing side only has seven hearing this Hassen let out a loud laugh haha what kind of brain dead idiots are these damn it only seven people and they dare to challenge thousands have we clarified the background of these seven fools yet the man looked up and said honestly there's a person named yiu he leads the Mong team of the hanm mo group upon hearing this Hassan no longer had the mocking expression he had before he was astonished and repeated L Wu the moal team after saying this he immediately stepped outside muttering as he walked Dan it hanmo dares to strike at me first could it be that they already know about my plan Hassen Stood Still observing the situation below seeing the chaos he clenched his teeth in Anger thinking it really is the Mong team I dared to attack Infinity City because hanm MO is far enough Away by the time they reacted I would have seized the initiative I never expected they would take the initiative to come here now my plan is ruined damn it suddenly a loud explosion echoed Hassan's subordinates began to panic those kids over there only had seven people even if we die we must drrive them down with us someone shouted in fear even if they only have seven people they are the Mong team we can't win run quickly but they had not yet had a chance to flee when onean how charged in don't you Scoundrels didn't you say you wanted to attack Infinity City is this all the skill and spirit you have yinan praised y Wu while fighting the opposing team's morale has completely collapsed yiu strategy is truly perfect meanwhile the others outside are working together to create a barrier their strength is actually not weak if they truly decide to attack these people will pose a huge problem for us one person spoke up this is exactly Yu strategy he strikes r at the strongest Point causing the enemy to completely fall apart I didn't expect that kid to have grown to this extent elsewhere G Wang Chuan was fighting alone wielding his sword skillfully in his heart he admired y Wu not only has Yu matured but he is also completely different from before at this moment Hassen stood high above witnessing everything he watched as his subordinates fell one by one and sigh my people have lost all fighting Spirit from this unexpected assault I need to find a way to make them wake up I do not wish for them to defeat mong's team I just hope they can hold them off long enough for me to escape Hassan shouted to encourage his subordinates below Don't Be Afraid kids they are very powerful but we are more numerous if we can kill them today not only Infinity City but the entire safe zone of the west region will belong to us thinking of the countless riches that the HMO Corporation holds and imagining MMO's delighted face Hassan became even more excited all of that will be yours his words immediately had an effect as soon as the subordinates heard it they were filled with fervor that's right the Mong battle team is the last trump card of hanmo as long as we kill them hanmo will be finished another one chimed in the leader is right for the money the land and the women we'll risk it all he I also want to enjoy the debauched life of the upper class damn it let's go all out kill kill kill having achieved his goal of rousing his subordinates Hassan quickly turned to flee he smugly thought to himself mission accomplished now just run but just as he turned around Yu's voice rang out behind him where do you think you're going hearing the unfamiliar voice Hassen turned back horrified to see Yu had approached without him noticing seeing Hassan's silence Yi Wu coldly continued earlier I heard you say I would live more than a second in front of you now I'll begin counting down the time as soon as he finished speaking Hassan was even more astonished he couldn't believe it and asked again are you ywo saying that he drew his sword and charged at ywo growling what are you being so arrogant about I didn't fight hanm Mo does that mean I am afraid to fight you go die the confrontation quickly caused a huge commotion the followers below were terrified looking up and wondering what's wrong with the leader why is it exploding up there just moments later Hassan's head was thrown down by ywo this scene shocked the followers who immediately fell into Panic it's over the leader is dead why are we still fighting run run quickly seeing them hurry to flee Juan how turned to ask gwan Chuan Captain should we chase them giwan Chuan decisively replied no need just a bunch of trash however the matter did not end there the group like headless chickens had not run far when suddenly numerous lightning bolts struck down to block their way in horror they looked up and saw the valkyrie Marilyn standing high above she coldly declared in the name of Y woo let no one survive Upon finishing her words Marilyn immediately lunged down her hands continuously attacking the group of people died without having a chance to utter a final word continuous vibrations echoed from a quiet corner gwang cheu and asked yiu do you need to kill them all yiu did not look at him arms crossed replied of course these people are extremely evil in the wilderness they harm others but now in the super safe Zone I absolutely will not allow such people to exist the previous rules have come to a time for change on the other side Yin huan rescued the girls gently saying now you are safe free from now on no one will dare to bully you anymore G wine Chu and pondered for a moment before speaking you have changed you have become ambitious and want to seize everything Yi Wu chuckled softly are you afraid that my control will surpass Han Mo hearing that ji Wang Chun replied seriously no I fear you forget your original intent if that day comes I will use my sword to remind you of who you are Yi Wu extended his hand intending to shake hands with ji Wang Chuan then said If that day truly comes please do not be polite do not hold back at that moment ji Wang Chun also reached out and took Yu's hand don't worry when the time comes I will definitely use my strongest move a promise is a promise yiu replied his gaze Resolute at the main entrance of zone 9 Southwest safe Zone a group of people had gathered in front of the gate looking at each other and chattering excitedly why were all the people from the nine Zone suddenly summoned here what on Earth has happened one person question there has never been such a largescale gathering before it must be something serious another person chimed in could it be that a disaster is about to happen a worried voice rang out on the large screen above images of beast-like creatures tearing at each other struggling for survival against humans flashed clearly the brutal scenes made everyone feel tense in the center of the stands a man dressed in an elegant black suit his demeanor serious was none other than tan hanmo he stood tall scanning the crowd before speaking his voice rang out loud and clear 100 years ago our predecessors endured countless struggles and sacrifices to establish this southwest safe Zone to this day this place has continuously protected us and provided safety but the past is the past times are constantly evolving and the safe Zone must evolve as well as his voice fell everyone listened in intently their eyes filled with curiosity and anxiety the stern face of the man appeared before everyone his words echoed causing the group to be bewildered under the leadership of hanmo Corporation while the lives of everyone may be stable new problems have also Arisen he said the population is increasing rapidly causing the limited resources of the safe Zone to be unable to meet the survival needs of everyone therefore we cannot continue to confine ourselves within High walls we must bravely step out side he confidently raised his voice now is the time for us to unite once again just as our ancestors did to venture out of the safe Zone expand our territory and welcome a brighter future we must build a super safe area magnificent on the Wasteland so that all people can live a more stable and prosperous life below the group of people exchanged glances and whispered among themselves what is a super safe area I have never heard of it before but do we the common Folk really have the capability to step outside the safe Zone indeed even if we desire to expand our territory the Wasteland is filled with monstrous creatures venturing out would be akin to delivering ourselves to death seeing the anxiety clearly displayed on everyone's faces along with the various Expressions he calmly said please don't worry I do not require everyone go out and fight our hanmo Corporation has partnered with major corporations in the safe Zone to build new outposts and businesses in the Wilderness the first thing everyone needs to do is just to participate in the construction this will be a new beginning where everyone has a job and everyone has food to eat hearing him speak everyone began to murmur their eyes filled with skepticism and hope one person voiced that's right since the hanmo corporation took control even those without jobs have received supplies each month to live comfortably this in the past was something we didn't dare to dream of but no one wants to on this forever I also want to live a better more prosperous life the problem is there are too few jobs before and now there is an opportunity but the Wilderness is full of ferocious beasts will our safety be guaranteed I still think it would be better to stay in the safe Zone living is still better than risking our lives out there he listened to their discussions and then spoke firmly I believe everyone still remembers that our safe Zone has faced the threat of beasts invading many times but those who have dealt with with these dangers are not the hanmo corporation but a hero whose identity has never been publicly revealed to everyone he continued he has repeatedly rescued the safe Zone in times of crisis at the same time he will also lead us into a new era he immediately turned his hand toward yiu proudly introducing the name of this hero is yiu everyone should remember this name as it will surely be inscribed to the animals of the entire Southwestern safe Zone not only in the present but also in the history of the postar era upon seeing y woo they became even more confused and skeptical saying I've heard of this character before but I never expected him to be so young isn't he the son of my classmate just look at such a talented child throughout history Heroes Have often been youths but can such a young child truly possess such great capabilities while they were still in a days trying to process all the information the large door suddenly began to open gradually everyone collectively gasped and stared what the large door of the safe zone is opening I have lived over 40 years and have never SE an open what's so special about this I've lived for more than 80 years and I've never seen this big door open before today really broadens my horizons Yi Wu simply smiled confidently snapped his fingers and looked at everyone he said next the real show is about to begin Upon finishing his words the loudspeaker above a Coke with sound these drones along with the defense system declared we could this only be a dream but no the images before our eyes are not Illusions but the actual results of the changes brought about by yiu thanks to this technology our grand goals can finally be achieved everyone let us courageously move forward on the path of light that Yu is opened for us let us together reach for a beautiful future hearing this the group joyfully jumped up indeed this is a phenomenon never seen in a 100 years the future that we once dared to only dream of is now so close finally this day has come even as Ordinary People we can create our own future Long Live Southwest safe Zone Long Live hanm Mo Corporation Long Live y woo hanm Mo turned to Y woo nervously asking I have followed your instructions and everything that needed to be done has been done but will the final result truly be as you predicted can we unite everyone after all the human heart is the most unpredictable thing upon hearing this Yu smiled and replied the human heart is indeed unpredictable but desire is very easy to grasp his gaze was full of confidence as he said live on to make money to want a better life the specific desires of each person may differ but everything still revolves around these things in this world talking about ideals is of no use what we need to do is satisfy human desires and from there unite everyone to build a super safe Zone that aligns with common interests he kept gazing at the distant Sky unaware that at some point M had stood behind him with a flushed face shily staring at him the special Aura full of ambition and Leadership charm of ywu had now matured to the point of making others admire him hadn't it in the wilderness a wild beast looked towards the sea being built and angrily said what dares to make such a commotion in my territory let's see if I can crush it but before the Beast could take any action it was immediately shot down by a tank in front leaving no chance at the MAA Village a man stood with his back turned gazing at the situation below then said all right as long as this road is repaired it can effectively connect with other concentrated areas finally we can welcome a better life he looked at the person beside him and said said in a deep voice truly Yu is impressive to be able to create such a magnificent act but thinking carefully Who besides him could achieve this level he shook his head slightly inside the younger generation is worthy of respect the younger generation is worthy of respect it's just a Pity that my foolish precious daughter I told her before that Rice Cooks into a meal but she wouldn't listen now well there's no chance for her to catch up with others anymore the woman beside him chuckled Softly and said you should stop worrying Elder the women around y woo must be lining up I'm afraid there's no more room for your daughter elsewhere at the Breaking Bad Club a girl with purple hair stood high and respectfully said to the person in front of her president to be honest I didn't expect you to agree to Yu's request the man in front frowned slightly and asked in a deep voice doesn't that mean we can no longer continue making those ban drugs what will happen to our business hearing this the girl smirked slightly her eyes filled with calculation in business the most important thing is to have vision and be able to predict the changes brought about by Yi Wu cannot be stopped anymore we can't stand aside we can only Embrace this change she paused for a moment and continued perhaps our change should start with changing to a harmless name at the Southwest safe Zone yiu stood high up gazing at the scenery below he pondered to himself I never expected that I would end up doing things like this at first I just wanted to become strong enough to protect everyone and that was enough but I didn't expect that in the end I would follow the path that the principal had once hoped for he frowned stroking his chin and thought perhaps this is exactly the meaning of inheritance that the principal once spoke of when he handed the MU way map to me he mentioned exploring the inheritance to pave the way for Humanity's future but where will this inheritance Lead Me among the six Kings does the fake kingk Mission include the king of humanity as he was lost in thought a voice suddenly interrupted his train of thought there's a female Captain requesting to speak with you upon hearing this Yu picked up the call seeing sui looking awkwardly through the screen he anxiously asked why you look so exhausted I told you to help Nana rebuild Infiniti City what happened sui weakly replied Master Nana no it's the queen mechanic from another world she has betrayed us upon receiving the information yiu immediately sped up on the way he carefully thought out of nowhere why did nana suddenly betray us has her rebellious phase come without any signs recalling the captain's words from earlier he became even more confused Master young lady Nana has betrayed us the control of the defense system of infinity city has been forcibly seized by her even the control of our bodies is about to fall into her hand hands Master please hurry here you must be quick Yu pondered earlier the captain didn't have time to explain clearly before the call was abruptly cut off Nana what are you doing Yi Wu accelerated the ship racing forward this is a critical time to establish the super secure Zone there must absolutely be no mistakes as he approached the Southwest safe Zone gate number two an alarm immediately sounded warning warning detected that safe Zone number two is under attack by the enemy activate the anti-air defense system yiu was startled to see thousands of heavy missiles aimed stray at him he suddenly realized the control of the defense of infinity city has truly been seized and they even see me as an attacking enemy he quickly used his rolling tube skills to avoid each Fierce attack but I must admit the anti-aircraft Firepower is getting better and better which pleases me it seems they have invested quite a bit of effort after saying that he immediately released the distraction ammunition the system's voice resonated approaching the enemy activating level two anti-aircraft Firepower the deeper he moved in the stronger the attacks became he smirked very good very good this Firepower will surely deal a crushing blow to the fly Beast however when the waves of attacks targeted the ship he immediately jumped out of it the most account transfer system crazily processed calmly he spread his wings and Dove straight in Nana stood nearby seemingly confused about the target as they entered the second safe Zone in the southwest yiu looked around and remarked even inside the safe Zone it's built so thoroughly despite the influence of Nana's personal Aesthetics with mechanical elements dominating it cannot be denied that this work is genuinely well done as he landed the system once again announced in a mechanical voice the enemy has infiltrated the safe Zone he said ground defense units have been ordered to execute as soon as he finished speaking a group of female robots appeared in front of him the female robots gazed at him with murderous intent identifying the first Target Yi wo looking at the modified female robots before him he thought have the other female robots been completely controlled by Nana their level seems to have increased significantly compared to before without thinking much they immediately charged towards him kill him immediately seeing them he coldly commanded just in time let the master test whether you have truly become stronger having transformed into the Red Emperor dark flame form as soon as he finished speaking his whole body turned a dark purple the group of female robots targeted him and launched their attacks he dodged their strikes while complimenting them very good your strength has definitely improved since I entrusted you to Nana it seems Nana is carrying out the task I assigned perfectly his expression darkened so what exactly happened that made Nana obey and take her Duty seriously only this suddenly betray he quickly switched to the most Sai account and madly used mechanical control powers to make them topple to the ground looking at them he said You all take a little nap I will handle the next matter the system immediately appeared before y Wu and said master I have detected signals similar to those of the female slave captain in the birthing room beneath the ground it seems they Captain has not yet been completely controlled he looked at the system and nodded go meet her right away if we want to clarify what happened to Nana we can only rely on her in the safe Zone in the underground laboratory as yigu stepped in he saw the female slave Captain standing there her voice rang out but not from her mouth rather from the communication device inside Master the transformation from young lady Nana to me is almost complete right now I cannot speak on my own anymore I can only communicate through this device I tried to run out to find someone but I was captured again please do not let my conversion Powers go to waste I am worried that the important images I have tried to save will be deleted she looked weakly at him her eyes full of pleading Master while I am not yet fully transformed please use your powers to read all the images that I have saved they will help you uncover the truth the system looked at him and hurriedly said no need to worry about changing yourself I I also want to forcibly retain information to convey to you master her loyalty has exceeded the limits of the life support team he stepped forward gently placing his hand on the forehead of the female robot Captain and said I understand I respect her wishes thank you for what she has done the system immediately began to work reading memory data and completing the integration of the Consciousness explanation of the life support team her memories quickly appeared before him at first everything went smoothly we followed our master's orders under the guidance of miss Nana we carried out the Reconstruction of Infiniti City in an orderly manner everything remained stable until that day we were extracting the necessary resources for the construction at a location far from Infiniti City suddenly out of nowhere a strange fog approached covering the entire excavation area the low level robotic equipment immediately became ineffective only our life support team retained consciousness to investigate the cause we instructed the resource extraction supporters to stay put afterwards our life support team along with miss Nana delved into the fog to probe The Source she continued finally we passed through the thick fog and arrived at a strange place this area was filled with endless mountains and dense forests stretching far and wide our orientation sensors and coordinate devices were both rendered useless however miss Nana was determined to venture into the forest to investigate the cause so we had to leave one person behind to Mark the Spot after that we followed the path and delve deeper into the woods eventually we discovered the wreckage of an alien spaceship that had crashed and been destroyed over 10,000 years ago miss Nana ordered all of us to stay outside while she entered the spaceship alone she continued a long time later miss Nana emerged from the spaceship but she looked completely different from that point on her personality became stubborn and violent she even frequently mumbled to herself about unclear things until one day miss Nana went insane she claimed to be the mechanical Queen from another planet and she altered the defense Protocols of the safe Zone forcing us to undergo modifications at this moment the system announced abnormal Consciousness has interrupted the memory reading image the female robot Captain trembling with red eyes said Master hurry I am about to be modified and I will will soon attack you please you must save miss Nana finishing her words she immediately charged at him the mechanical Voice still echo in his ears Target kill detected ye woo immediate kill required he reached out and pressed his finger to her forehead the female robot Captain fainted and fell into his arms looking at her he gently said thank you for holding back so much important information for me this helped a lot now you should sleep for a while trust me I will definitely rescue Nana the system beside him reported master I have scanned the entire safe Zone but found no trace of Nana she is certainly near the location of the destroyed spaceship furthermore I have retrieved previous memories of the birthing room and obtain the coordinates to the entrance of the favy land shall we go now he asked sternly do I even need to ask the alien spaceship crash the mechanical Queen from another planet and Nana's betrayal are all related to the suddenly appearing fobby land although Yin Hanan has warned me about its dangers to uncover the truth we must enter to part on the edge of the foggy area y Wu observed the situation and pondered according to the coordinates they had previously entered from this spot on the way here I also review the existing documents related to the foggy area the information indicates that this area is a random space that exists within reality due to its integration with special dimensional Rifts it forms an unstable space with special rules y Wu thought even though when the earth Network era originated the dimensional Rifts created copies these copies usually followed reasonable and clear rules the foggy area is different it does not regard levels and contains unpredictable special rules as long as those rules are not followed no matter how high the level one will be forcibly killed it feels like there is a black hand manipulating everything from behind therefore despite rumors that it holds many rare Treasures that ordinary copies do not have no one dares to risk stepping into this crazy space thinking about this y Wu became even more anxious moreover the images in my memory show that when Nana and the others entered the Fabby land they did not violate any special rules there therefore I did not receive any warning notifications this means that if I step into the foggy land a slight mistake could lead to death moreover the system could not save me ye will continue to walk through the Mist this is a completely active rhythm of seeking death but I must enter after all it is the responsibility and obligation of a parent to make a rebellious child realize their mistakes and return after walking for a while the Mist gradually dissipated youu looked at the scenery before him and couldn't help but exclaim indeed this place is as beautiful as the images in my memory well at least now I have verified that talking and breathing will not violate the rules after speaking yiwu continued to roam around to observe what is the most restrictive rule dear I cannot let myself be enchanted by the scenery around me I must be cautious with every step however just as he took a step forward something suddenly slashed down beside him Yu was startled and quickly switched to the account of the Chen Emperor narrowly avoiding it he furrowed his brow and thought have I already violated the rules just by taking one step damn it it and this branch is made of metal even the flame form couldn't cut it more and more Roots erupted from the ground wrapping around Yu he now firmly believed this is indeed one of the rules after realizing this Yu gave up on Resistance he stood still allowing the roots to tightly bind him thinking to himself giving up on counterattacking men Yu thought to himself faced with the existence that disregards hierarchy continuing to attack is completely meaningless to break this deadlock I need to find the rules here just as he was being pulled down into the ground by The Roots ymu wondered why from the very beginning did I encounter the taboo while the bionic girl and Nana were able to delve deep into the Misty land he kept pondering asking himself did I overlook any detail and the memories from before Yu's mind gradually became chaotic in those memories is there something important that I have not realized I need to remember if not if this goes on I will truly die this thought just flashed by and he immediately regained his composure Yu gathered his strength and gave a strong push causing a great upheaval he told himself there's no way a person who has gone through many battles could let these rules bind him to death when he broke free from the ground Yu's body had transformed into the form of Pandora's secret he laughed at himself it's all because I was too cautious thinking too complicated in fact the rules were already very clear they are within my memories yiu realized Nana and the bionic girl could delve deep into the Misty land because they are not human to be more precise they are not human formed by elements y Wu walked while throwing off the remaining Roots stuck to his body thinking to himself as long as I use Pandora's secret to conceal my energy I can perfectly disguise myself as mechanical life and bypass the forbidden zone taking a few more steps he admired himself good thing I have so many tricks if it were someone else they would have definitely perished by now speaking of which how long has it been since I opened a new account with the current situation becoming increasingly unpredictable I might need to unlock a few new accounts Yi Wu continued deeper into the Misty land the further he progressed the more he noticed the surroundings are strangely metallic not only the trees but also the ground and rocks have turned to metal like stepping into an extraterrestrial a cannibal civilization could it be that all of this was created by Nana it seems I have underestimated her too much Nana after walking for a while yiu saw numerous robots diligently repairing things he frowned and wondered is Nana being lazy because of this the work her master assigned to her is left undone and she turns out to be here busy with her own tasks suddenly a multitude of laser beam shot toward him an alarm sounded blaringly warning warning enemy intrusion detected all attack mechanisms activated immediately after that the alien machine giant spider appeared the machine kept repeating one phrase lock Target kill immediately however ye will remain calm showing no fear he spoke up Nana don't hide anymore come out now do you think this toy can stop me the wrong doings you've done I need a reasonable explanation if not the only outcome for a disobedient child is a spanking Nana remained Silent not responding the only sound in the space was the mechanical voice of the giant spider kill immediately kill immediately the giant creature immediately charged to attack Yu but instead of hitting the target it fell into his trap causing its Health to drop to 20% while a giant spider was still probing the surroundings Yu suddenly appeared on its back he coldly asked are you looking for me when we were children we were often taught one thing a child watching a play should keep their mouth shut after saying that Yi Wu executed a move to pin the giant spider down to the ground without a moment's hesitation he struck several blows acting while speaking if not I'll teach you as well having resolved the matter Yi Wu continued speaking with the tone of a Victor Nana now come out and admit your mistakes I can forgive you if I have to go looking for you the consequences will be more than just a spanking as soon as he finished speaking a female voice rang out accompanied by a mocking laugh ha it seems you don't understand your position master or should I say former Master because now in this world no one surpasses me at this moment Nana had become the mechanical Queen nfina at level 380 she frowned and growled I hate being called Nan of the most that small and weak name is truly despicable remember this my real name is nfina and from this moment on that that name will make the entire planet tremble in fear Nana continued recounting her past I am the mechanical Queen from a distant planet by a twist of fate my Consciousness was reborn into the body you created my home planet m79 was invaded by an outside force I was betrayed killed and could only be reborn in this body therefore I reluctantly became part of your household neph furrowed her brows her eyes flashing with anger she said but fortunately many years a AG go I ordered the deployment of ships to explore other universes this destroyed spaceship is one of the mining ships I sent out back then before I had to lower my voice and Obey you simply for the sake of survival in the end I have broken free the more she spoke the colder naina's gaze became and her voice was filled with resentment now I have obtained energy from the spaceship although I have not recovered to my Peak it is already strong enough compared to your kind finally I no longer have to engage in the disgusting Act of pretending to be a family with you nef's words completely enraged Yi Wu he fell silent clenched his fists his eyes Resolute coldly he said are you done speaking let me make it clear to you that no matter who your body currently contains in my eyes you are still Nana still the person my family cherishes the most your petty thoughts and stubbornness I can tolerate but you absolutely cannot betray the family at this point you U's voice grew grave but it could not hide his imposing presence right now turn back and apologize I can forgive you and might not even need to administer punishment hearing this nef's eyes were filled with disbelief and she exclaimed what she angrily questioned V woo do you not see the situation clearly or do you not understand what I am saying back then I had to obey you because I was too weak but now I have grown stronger than you a weakling like you no longer has the right to lecture me nafina charged at ywu in Anger right after finishing her words but he simply dodged lightly without retaliating seeing this she snapped her face filled with frustration why aren't you fighting back do you think so little of me y w remains silent his attitude only fueled her Fury further where is the strong man from before stop treating me like a child I'm no longer your nana from back in the day after saying that nafina immediately shifted to a high powerered form fiercely attacking him I will use my strength to show you exactly who I am finally yiu began to respond he activated the Pandora magic box and used the super alloy combat aircraft to block her strikes seeing this nafina burst out laughing with delight haha finally ready to fight back come on ye woo I will unleash all my penup fury on you a series of powerful techniques were Unleashed turning the battle into an unending Rin of bombs and bullets initially nafina enjoyed exchanging blows but it wasn't long before she realized something was off anger grew more and more evident on her face something's wrong damn it why aren't you fighting back fight back you bastard are you afraid to go head-to-head with me just running away always running don't you want to teach me a lesson want to spank me then why am I chasing you and hating you like this now no matter how provocatively she spoke y wo remained steadfast he did not attack nafina but focused solely on his own intentions skillfully evading blows while moving away from that place seeing this nafina immediately chased after him shouting loudly don't run you bastard I will definely catch you trample you underfoot make you apologize to me and have you shout long live the mechanical queen as soon as she finished speaking Yu stood in front of his super alloy War Chariot he said in a deep voice my patience has run out it is time to educate you without delay yiu placed his hand on and began to control the Machinery nifin his body was gradually being disassembled she began to panic muttering my transformation state is being forcibly gchu I am the mechanical Queen how can I lose control of the Machinery against you but soon that arrogance disappeared she screamed in pain it hurts it hurts it hurts too much yiu looked at her and coldly said I admit that I was a bit harsh with you in the past allowing you to do many things that harm the pride of the mechanical Queen that's why I didn't fight back earlier letting you vent all your resentment on me but my patience has its limits I can't keep indulging you forever nefa still could not accept this truth she shouted what is your attitude I am a highlevel mechanical Queen having lived for over a thousand years not a child who can be bullied damn it why why have I used all my strength but still cannot defeat you you will gradually return to his normal form he asked if it's not due to venting your Grievances and anger then why must you defeat me nafina gritted her teeth and replied because you are the greatest obstacle to my domination of this world only by killing you can I achieve that yuu frowned and continued to ask dominate the world that sounds like the classic lines of a villain but didn't you look down on this low-level backward planet of ours what's the point of dominating it she laughed mockingly indeed you are just low-level beings on a low-level Planet even if you govern yourselves it wouldn't change anything but I will spend a 100 years even a thousand years to transform this world into a fully mechanical Planet like my mother star are you scared Yu still did not show any clear attitude he continued to ask then what next after the transformation is complete what you want to do she angrily replied replied Revenge exploiting the planet after terraforming it turning it into a Mothership and returning to kill those traitors who betrayed me Yu at this moment crossed his arms straightforwardly expressing his desire to help then I'll help you kill the ones who have betrayed you the long and complex process you mentioned would be simplified right as soon as he finished speaking nafina was taken aback her CPU seemed to fry as she tried to think ah what he said seems very reasonable I can't refute it could there really be this option nafina hesitated a bit it seems like what he said makes sense and with his abilities who knows you might actually be able to do it but right after that she regained her composure reminding herself no that's not right other than myself I should trust no one the one I trusted the most before caused me to suffer terribly like this thinking of this nafina shouted loudly her entire body exploded with a surge of strength deception it's all a deception don't think you can trick me with sweet words I absolutely will not fall for it seeing that he could not convince her ywu side he could no longer hold back and resolutely countered kids at the rebellious age definitely don't listen to anything it seems the only way to make her obedient is to spank her when throwing a tantrum there should be limits wake up Nana hearing this aren NE finna refused to back down she stepped up to confront Yu arguing loudly while attacking I am not a kit in your eyes and I am certainly not anything called nana I am the mechanical Queen Arena nafina a loud explosion resounded neina returned to her original form collapsing to the ground dazed as she murmured why why I clearly had absolute power yet I still couldn't defeat you after saying this she was exhausted and fell down sobbing nafina exclaimed if I cannot take revenge then what is the meaning of living in this world I might as well just die but before nafina could fall completely down Yu quickly caught her nef looked up her eyes brimming with tears questioning y woo you why even though I betrayed you wanted to kill you and did countless things to harm others you still haven't given up on me why are you so gentle with me Yu having finished her words angrily slapped Nana hard on her bottom do you think death is the solution what you should be thinking about now isn't life or death but reflecting on yourself do you understand your mistakes will you dare to do such things again in the future Nana like a child burst into tears who it hurts so much I was wrong really wrong I won't dare to do it again I won't I promise who please don't hit me anymore I truly understand my mistakes now yve asked sternly have you reflected and recognized your mistakes yet Nana knelt on the ground crying and said who I've realized it I shouldn't cause trouble in Infinity City and I shouldn't think about dominating this planet I definitely shouldn't have the delusion of defeating a monster like my master I won't seek revenge anymore after all my plan cannot be executed Hulu hearing that Yu side shaking her head in disappointment hemp are you reflecting or blaming me he looked at her smiled slightly and said all right if you have sincerely ad committed your mistakes and it also been hit quite hard then what I said will help you get your revenge I won't go back on my word hearing you we say that Nana looked up in Surprise and asked with some doubt really really not although I don't really need your help I can manage on my own before she finished speaking ywu pretended as if he wanted to take back his words what then I don't care huh I originally thought although you are very mischievous and don't listen you are still a person I cherish so I should help you as soon as he finished speaking n burst into tears again who master I was really wrong before the person who treats me so well and yet I I still having said only half of it Nana cried even harder rushing to hug Yu leg tightly master from now on whatever you say I will listen you are my electricity my light the only hero in my heart whoohoo Master you are really good seeing none as exaggerated display like this Yi Wu felt a bit helpless and thought what is this he gently called out Nana to take revenge for you I need to know more information Nana quickly replied um let's go inside the spaceship to talk inside the spaceship y Wu immediately asked my home planet m79 is a purely mechanical planet with a volume five times that of Earth located about 10,000 years away from Earth its scientific civilization level is much more advanced than that of Earth but how could you control this ship to reach Earth even if you are a mechanical life form with an infinite lifespan what can you do with this broken spaceship Nana proudly replied you don't know do you this spaceship carries various Advanced technical materials from a home planet the most important thing is that it also carries the Gate of transition hearing this unfamiliar item Yu confirmed gate of transition you say nana explained that's right this was originally used by me to explore new worlds when the spaceship comes to a suitable Planet the Gate of transition will automatically open people from the home planet can pass through it to reach the new planet however the Gate of transition on this spaceship is currently still in its original state but lacks the energy to activate it Nana continued therefore I have devised two plans the priority plan is to utilize all of Earth's energy to supplement the Gate of transition but the Energy Efficiency of this planet is too low if the supplementation fails I can only transform Earth into a Mothership and gradually push it further into space one day I might be able to return ywu seem to have a clear understanding of the situation he continued therefore regardless of any plan that might succeed it will lead to destructive outcomes for Earth and Humanity Nana replied without any concealment that's right but if someone as strong as the master is involved there might be a chance to open up a different path finding a way that satisfies both sides after hearing this ye W silently commanded I vis a scan all the advanced Science and Technology on the spaceship and also assess whether mosta has the capability to master and utilize this technology soon after I Vis responded Master we have just acquired a significant amount of useful advanced technology noticing the unusual tone and IIs voice Yi Wu directly asked then there's no need to be this excited did you discover something particularly noteworthy I viz answer his voice full of excitement as expected of the master yes that mad scientist Mo saag created equipment for interspace and latitude travel in fact he was even able to create a time machine however these Advanced devices were lost after his death now Master after inheriting his abilities if we want to manufacture similar items we will need the blueprints just now I have acquired a vast collection of advanced blueprints based on the current needs of the super security Zone I have compiled some very useful Technologies y Wu remains silent listening to IIs report the device to Shield geomagnetic interference has the capability to rehabilitate Wilderness transforming this area into a super safe Zone as a result the space Corridor is unobstructed remove the communication shielding within the safe Zone and communication can cover the entire area there is no need for Relay station even the nearby Wilderness can easily connect information another important technology is the near Earth orbital satellite system this technology allows for the construction and launch of satellites into orbit performing real-time monitoring of the entire super safe Zone even the whole earth with this technology anything that happens in the area or on the planet cannot be hidden from the owner after I Vis finished the report yiwu's mood visibly improved he proudly said you have grown up you useful now I did not expect you to bring so much Advanced Scientific Technology the spanking you received earlier was worth it with the help of these Technologies the future of the super safe Zone will be secured once he finished speaking yiu adjusted his emotions and seriously asked a vis how should we supplement the energy for the Gate of transition a vis calculated a bit then frowned and replied Master after careful analysis and calculation I conclude that the entire energy source on Earth is insufficient to replenish the Gate of transition the only way is to absorb energy from nearby planets to succeed hearing this Yu was astonished isn't the energy of those planets solar energy hey exploiting the Sun at close distance to supplement energy for the Gate of transition isn't that a bit beyond limits I Vis responded his tone calm but serious indeed this is entirely different from your outdated solar energy technology one must be at a distance sufficiently close to the planet to effectively absorb energy however the Science and Technology of Mac can manufacture devices to absorb planetary energy but with the current level of technology and material strength in this world it is completely incapable of supporting this technique listening to I Vis Yi Wu fell into thought since the Earth originated the development of humanity has been limited they are even forced to search for parallel spaces like dimensional Rift and dungeons emerge essentially allowing us to develop horizontally but to make a breakthrough vertically has been completely locked down GW thought the Earth is filled with chaotic magnetic fields making it extremely difficult to even fly in the air let alone break through the atmosphere to venture into space in the past for Humanity flying into space was a very simple matter but now this has become completely impossible the materials and scientific Works related to space exploration have either not been developed or are not even necessary to develop the reason is that the main goal of humanity now is survival in the current situation who still cares about outer space or the universe y Wu silently thought however the promise made to Nana no matter how difficult it is I must fulfill otherwise the reputation I have built in front of the child will vanish at that moment the voice of the system rang out the host has triggered a special condition successfully un blocking one of the king fate missions become the cane of Machinery planet m79 is a planet entirely made of mechanical metal helping neina regain control of this planet will complete the mission this Mission has no time limit after the system finished its announcement The Voice disappear immediately ye thought so the second Branch mission of King Fate has been opened indeed there is fortune and disaster this time there is no turning back by all means I must find a way to complete the en supplement for the Gate of transition at that moment Nana walked up pointed at I Vis and clicked her tongue Tech 6 this thing of yours has a bit of knowledge but not much the Science and Technology of this world may not be great but that doesn't mean the Science and Technology of my world can't do anything Nana smuggle continued don't be fooled by my spaceship even though it's a pile of scrap metal now the high-end materials are still highr even when broken down it's no problem problem to resist the heat of the planet as long as we break down the materials of this ship and reconstruct them into a device to absorb the planet's energy we can point towards the Sun and start sucking I Vis upon hearing this retorted angrily wait I've clearly gone invisible how did you detect me Nana calmly replied I didn't notice earlier but now I am stronger even if I can't defeat a monster like my master don't you think I can detect a low-level robot like like you after saying that Nana immediately closed the distance to I Vis her eyes revealing a dangerous glint she continued her tone dripping with sarcasm speaking of which you must have been talking behind my back before right I am the mechanical Queen you could say I am the biological mother albeit with a different father of mechanical life forms like you children who talk behind their mother's back will get their bottoms spanked a vis though afraid still tried to retort you were slandering me I only watched you because I was punished by my master and wanted to vent my frustrations on you Nana upon hearing this became Furious and resolutely wanted to beat I Vis she shouted do you still dare to argue watch me hit you I Vis was not to be outdone stuttering back you you can't just shout without taking action seeing that they were about to fight y Wu quickly intervened enough save your energy for discussing the main issue with me now we have something that can withstand the heat of the planetary equipment and the technology to absorb energy from the Sun but think about the distance from Earth to the sun it's too far and Humanity's understanding of the universe is currently very limited we do not have a thorough understanding of the dimensional riffs and parallel time this issue arose after the Earth Network era became a reality causing science and technology in human development to completely shift Direction what worries me more is whether the laws of the universe will change if there exists an unbreakable rule such as Earth being confined and unable to venture far into the universe then everything we do will be in vain Nana began to feel disappointed indeed there is still no way I shouldn't have held on to hope at the beginning her heart was filled with resentment men's words are indeed misleading Yu said he wanted to take revenge for me it's really all just deceiving kids as if understanding what Nana was thinking Yu walked over p her head and comforted her don't be discouraged this is just the worst case scenario that I hypothesize regardless of what obstacles lie ahead we must proceed the most important thing now is to be patient the unexpected close contact coupled with his determined words caused Nana to blush involuntarily she stuttered am master I I am not discouraged my life is Limitless I've been waiting for so many years I'm not lacking a little more time but conver firstly Master you need to hurry you can't live that long at this point she paused and said no more in her heart she silently told herself forget it although others are untrustworthy if it's y wo I'll force myself to trust in once Yu suddenly realized the meaning behind her words he frowned and asked back what do you mean I can't live that long can't you hope for me to live well then he turned to Nana and said let's take this spaceship back to the base first if we transport it directly to the safe Zone it might lead to conflicts with the Eastern great faction which could spark a large scale War Nana patted her chest and took on the task this small matter is up to me to handle yet in her heart she quietly sighed Hayes although he is strong enough without me he still can't manage not long after they returned to the base when the members of his group saw the gigantic spaceship in front of them they were so astonished that they couldn't speak this this is what is it a ship but it doesn't look much like one y Lord truly surprises people always overturning our perceptions another person immediately echoed of course Yu Lord is the hero who once saved our entire race now he gives us a new life at this moment a curious little green friend asked Li woo what did you bring this bit and hard thing here for he pointed up at the sky and confidently replied I want to use it to fly to space the little friend asked further what is space y Wu patiently explained it is a place higher and further than the sky hearing that it immediately sent with excitement how dreamy I want to go see it too but as soon as the sentence ended it lowered its head now I can slowly feel the sensation of being imprisoned that Uncle mentioned although this world is very good I still want to go outside and take a look hearing that ywu patted its shoulder a assuring I promise you when the right time comes I will definitely take you to explore the colorful world including the universe as soon as y wo finished speaking it brightened up lifting its head to confirm really y wo thank you after the conversation Yu returned to the control room at that moment Nana approached cheerfully saying Master can we start restructuring the spacecraft now I'm so eager y Wu responded calmly not so fast do you remember what mission I assigned to you before being asked like that Nana shyly answered I remember rebuild Infinity C getting the correct answer he happily continued then let's wait until you complete this Mission and we will improve the spacecraft together hearing that Nana's mood improved significantly she nodded vigorously okay you must keep your promise if not I will punish the master the girl's words made yuai in helpless Ness he thought to himself I just disciplined her and already she's starting to flip the guest host Dynamic kids nowadays really are getting harder to raise just then a girl with red hair ran in her tone cheerful woo and Chang said that he has regained part of his memory upon hearing this Yu couldn't help but be astonished and asked what really and Chang walked in shilly scratching his head that's right I suddenly remember that I once made a Packa with the demon Beast I think its name is Liu jinel one of the 28 constellations the third star under the Eun Dragon King but for more significant information like the specific rank or special abilities I still can't recall hearing this Yi Wu felt even more confident in his plan his eyes brightened as he replied to inchang it's okay just this much information is enough defeating that boss I believe you can restore your human form he thought to himself recently aside from Nana causing a bit of trouble it's really been all good things taking advantage of this Stroke of Luck I must perfectly resolve the leftover issues from the past then a for the universe after in Chang recalled part of his memory Yi Wu tried to extract more information and Chang Senor do you still remember how to contact the demon Beast you formed a pack with this magic Crystal was from before when you made the pack with that demon Beast recently this magic Crystal has been aitt hting unusual light and Chang replied his voice contemplative I finally remembered the act of making a PCT with the demon Beast and the mistakes I made it's good that I can use this magic Crystal to reach out to that demon Beast pretend I want to meet it then we can take the opportunity to force it to help me regain my human form right Yu shook his head seriously and chain you don't need to worry whether you regain your human form or not isn't important right now I just want to destroy those demon beasts they have caused you to become this way and Chang smiled Riley his eyes filled with pain no ye woo I have become like this because I deserve it but those who I harmed to death were innocent it was my desire to become powerful that led me to make a PCT with the demon Beast I even hid the activation device for the demon BEAST's hexagram portal in the safe Zone harming everyone he paused for a moment then continued his voice deep in my foolishness and greed have caused all of this I know that even if I die 10,000 times it won't be enough to atone for my sins but still before I die I want to do something meaningful I must annihilate all the demon beasts seeing her younger sibling tormented like this and he rushed over to hen chain saying you did These Foolish things just to find me if you are guilty then I am equally guilty we will atone together and we will enter the demon Beast slay together no matter what I will go with you and Chang thought is this what family is although I have no memories of her at all it feels as if just having her here I can find Salvation yiu said and Chang senior do you still remember where you hid the hexagram portal activation device that the demon Beast gave you and Chang sighed softly and shook his head I'm sorry I've fought a lot but I can't remember where I put that Yu said seriously although it sounds ironic for me to say this we must quickly find the hexagram portal activation device otherwise the safe area will face danger again and Chang bent down and hug Yu's legs in recent days from my parents accounts I've learned about the number of times the demon Beast has invaded in the past that number coincides with the number of times the demon Beast magic crystals have glowed In My Memory he looked up at everyone his voice full of seriousness in other words the glowing of the demon Beast Magic crystals now means that the demon Beast will invade once again he said although I have forgotten our previous relationship I will not hesitate to beg for your help once again please you must help me stop the demon beasts from invading right now only you can do this Yu said senior you really have changed previously you were someone who was willing to sacrifice the entire human world for your sister and Chang said was I really that kind of person before indeed I have done too too many wrong things Yu said but it's hard to say right or wrong when only thinking for oneself in this era However the fact that you can change like this now is mostly due to the fact that the demon that possessed you absorbed all the anger and desires within you in this apocalyptic period the bad people always live more comfortably and happily but good people must endure much more suffering and sorrow so anchang senior are you ready to face all of this and Chang said in the past I did too many wrong things in search of my sister now that my sister has been found even though I am loaded with sins I still want become a good person no matter how much more suffering I have to endure I will atone for my sins ye woo please tell me what I should do I will listen to you even in hell I will still strive for heaven Yu said and Chang Senor I have understood your determination next the most urgent matter for us is to find the hexagram portal activating device in the safe Zone the first demon Beast Invasion was only small in scale the demon Beast raid occurred in zone 9 with ghost eyed spider at level 18 because of this I encountered a disaster yet gained a fortune unlocking the king account system you continued for the second time from the Elite Academy Rave to the level 90 boss everything appeared in zone 9 for the third time the different cow here led to a conflict between hanmo and Wong Jen led by Thunder Demon Lyn and his demon beasts from this we can eliminate the possibility of coincidence and speculate that the hexagram portal activating device is very likely located in zone 9 and chain thought in Surprise thanks to this we can quickly narrow down the approximate location of the device Yu said however zone 9 is still too vast and the architectural layout is too chaotic finding the device will truly be very difficult Annie asked so what should we do is there really no other way y Wu said of course there is I will ask m n to call everyone in the safe Zone to participate in the search as long as we set a reward that makes people eager to take it we can definitely disrupt area 9 in a short amount of time moreover to ensure safety we can expand the search area to other regions after all we understand human greed very well and I have profound experience and Chang thought as long as the problem is identified a capable person will provide an answer and solve it so how did I get to know him before but that is only the first step the key is still to prevent the demon beasts from invading at their Source senior and Chang the Two Sisters should prepare equipment and supplies in one hour we will use the demon Beast magic crystals to communicate with that demon beast and directly attack their den they replied in unison all right we will go prepare we will directly storm the demon Beast den and eliminate them entirely so that there will be no more worry in the future as for controlling Humanity he has a very ruthless method and a style befitting a king I truly fall short of him but if I want to become his strategist I must quickly restore my human form and retrieve my lost memories baby Beetle said like woo I also want to help Yu said no I need you to protect the Fortress very well this spaceship is related to whether we can fly out into space or not that's right with such an important mission I must lift my spirits Nana you continue to mobilize the maintenance robots to carry out the restoration and renovation of the spaceship the maintenance of the second safe area must also continue but it can be entrusted to the Clone Maids for supervision the most important thing for you right now is to support the upgrade of the defense system in the main area the previous renovation and Improvement of the second safe area was not bad so keep it up um Master after you finish your work over here can you come back immediately to personally oversee the repair and renovation of the spaceship with me sure no problem once I deal with the demon Beast Invasion I will return immediately to speed up the spaceship repair process with you don't worry I'm far from worried I just want to quickly return to the mother star to take revenge but in consideration of your help I will complete the tasks you assigned at the fastest speed a few hours later in a wild place an Chang used a magic Crystal to contact the demon Beast Li Jin Joe said it's you I didn't expect you to actively contact me it's been so long since you delivered the magic crystals and you haven't contacted me since I thought you were dead if you have something to say hurry up I'm very busy and Chang replied his voice filled with anger my sister has been killed by humans I agree with your previous proposal I am willing to join you but you must help me take revenge on Humanity help me Kill Them All not leaving a single one alive leave jingel laughed loudly haha you should have done this sooner humans are not worth mourning recently I have been preparing to attack humans your joining now is perfectly timed in that piece of magic crystals you have there is a small teleportation gate that I have opened for you you can use it to come to my location we will discuss more there Li Jin joo's voice was full of determination this time we must completely devour the humans in the safe area use their corpses and Flesh and Blood to build the Sweet Paradise that belongs to us Le jingel fully trusted and Chang and immediately opened the hexagram portal for him to enter you can go directly here this is a place you have been to before I'm sure you know the way I await you to join me in this grand plan after he turned off the machine y wo and Annie had also arrived it seems that our first plan has succeeded the reaction of Liu jinel completely developed based on Yu's thoughts his intuition is astonishingly impressive at this moment I suddenly feel that losing my memory has brought about a Clarity that broadens the path ahead of me senior and Chang once said that compared to the complexities of human nature demon beasts are much simpler and more straightforward they are all filled with a desire for Slaughter which makes them easier to evaluate he chuckled softly did I say that before it seems I really had a deep interaction with demon beasts in the past Yu turned to menen it's time to test your acting skills next you will directly meet Li jingel continuing to pretend to submit to stabilize him and bias time Annie and I will sneak into the demon Beast Army creating chaos as needed to disrupt the hexagram portal when the demon beasts are in turmoil we will regroup and work together to defeat Li ginel and Chang nodded we will do as you say at this moment in the world of demon beasts hurry hurry to the hexagram portal the Lord has ordered us to attack the human world what are we waiting for let's go quickly if we let them depart first we will only have the scraps left to eat at the demon Beast gate the group of demon beasts were still lined up waiting isn't it ready yet a large demon Beast loudly asked I heard that human flesh and blood are more delicious than any other creature we're all so hungry we're drooling another demon Beast smirked look at that Clueless guy over there I've been to the human world a few times my brothers shared some culinary tips with me listen up the plump white round humans are the best rich and fatty don't waste time with the skinny ones they aren't worth it every time we teleport tens of thousands of troops just the energy to supply the hexagram portal consumes quite a lot of our magic crystals complained another demon Beast haha don't be sad about the magic crystals anymore just wait a little longer and we can Feast on humans to our heart's content the taste of a human is simply amazing in a corner y wo and Annie were hiding and observing the number of demon beasts gathered here is already greater than any previous Invasion moreover their levels are higher most of them are around level 50 to 60 while the elite ones reach levels 70 to 80 if they really invade the safe Zone the consequences will be unimaginable Annie nodded slightly her eyes worried fortunately they are still replenishing energy for the hexagram portal we still have time to carry out the plan but the biggest issue is the other bosses scattered across the cliffs and around the hexagram portal if we have to face multiple enemies at once the situation will be extremely unfavorable this name is Raku dog subordinate of the Azure Dragon shei oh Li Jin Jaa finally wants to make a move I'll just sit here watching the tigers fight each other while casually eating a few little demons that dare to brazenly walk walk through our territory I hope those humans can exert a bit of strength to deplete Lu jino's forces if so I can then gather their power liino intends to attack the humans I've heard that humans are all beasts their brains full of rubbish and so Gody that they truly make one sick I like that in a moment when chaos rains I can grab a few stinky men back I definitely need to enjoy myself no I must torture them brutally to feel satisfied heart mood Fox sub ordinate of the Azure Dragon heart damn it once again being outpaced by this dog Le jingel once he attacks the human base I'm afraid he wants to take credit in front of the master that's why I hate him with a passion Li ginou only relies on his shiny golden appearance to win the Master's favor clearly a robust and Powerful demon Beast like me is the real capable General tail Fire Tiger subordinate of the Azure dragon tail the system just announced a new brand Mission has opened King fate the mission requires defeating all 28 demon Beast bosses to become the king demon Beast yiwu's eyes lit up upon hearing this he slightly curled his lips another Branch Mission recently it's truly disaster and Fortune intertwined not bad at all Annie cautiously reminded vwoo this demon Beast world is too strange why do all the bosses appear at once like this those who are just watching from the outside are really potential danger if we only target one objective I'm afraid they will all attack us simultaneously Yu nodded his voice pensive exactly given the current situation the amount of information we hold is too little this makes the situation extremely unfavorable we need to find a way to quickly Scout the situation here Annie propose I have an idea if we capture a highlevel demon Beast I can make it spill some information it will surely answer all our questions Yi Wu smiled with satisfaction agreeing with the plan on another note since returning to enang not only has inchang changed but even Annie has become much more lively all right let's proceed with your suggestion suddenly a demon Beast accidentally dashed straight into Yu's position it shouted angrily damn it why did I just bump Into Thin Air who set up a barrier here Yu removed the barrier to speak with him congratulations on being the chosen one we want to find the messenger and the decision is that it will be you that was the rare elite Jang beuing level 80 damn it how could a human be here in the territory of demon beasts another demon beast interjected that's right actually there have been humans wandering into the territory of demon beasts before it said that person once met our Master but you're different what's your level he closely examined Yu's level and sneered oh it seems you are just a little child who accidentally stumbled into our demon Beast world how laughable with such a low level what do you think you can do the demon Beast continued to mock highlevel demon beasts like me have only ever dealt with foes of equal standing this is the principle of strong men like me kid consider yourself lucky to be alive if you encounter someone with absolute power and principles like me you should quickly get lost he chuckled faintly I really have no interest in killing you but I didn't expect a little demon Beast like you to be so interesting what the hell human what are you talking about he paused for a moment and warned I advise you to handle yourself properly and get out of here before he could finish his sentence he was stabbed in the back by Annie with a sword after stabbing an opponent Annie immediately turned back to Yu she said my sword is infused with various poisons from the Breaking Bad Club among them is a mind-controlling toxin that will take effect soon truly convenient upon hearing this the opponent's face turned pale but he still struggled to resist damn it you have forced me to take this seriously this time I must fight for real he growled and charged straight at the two but soon the poison began to take effect he staggered and strange Sensations started to emerge what is this feeling suddenly his gaze changed his voice became trembling yet filled with reverence ha may I ask my kind gentle beautiful and generous Master if you have any commands I your humble and most devoted servant will definitely dedicate myself to following all your orders Annie raised an eybrow and asked then tell me everything you know about your demon beasts in the meantime he didn't forget to flatter oh my how delightful your voice is my master you are truly a Celestial being descended to the Mortal realm from now on may I call you Annie Annie coldly shook her head giving no response he then turned to Yu and whispered but my master that male standing next to you it's currently mating season so you should be careful with him hearing this Yi Wu merely smiled faintly his sharp gaze sweeping over the man making him quickly shrink back fearing to say another word I'm leaving if you don't ask don't talk nonsense I turned to apologize to Y woo this type of poison is a bit Troublesome Annie our demon Beast work world is actually a large independent space the central area we are currently in is the demon Beast gate surrounding it are the independent territories of 28 leaders from four dependent tribes each large tribe has an Unwritten rule not to interfere with the independent development of the 28 territories for the demon beasts to invade the human world they must go through the center of the demon beasts however the demon Beast gate has significant limitations smallscale teleportation of a low level requires very little energy but if one wants to teleport on a large scale a massive source of energy is needed the energy source of the demon beasts comes from the experience points gained when demon beasts eat humans which are then transformed into blood chai magic crystals the lord of the anti- metal territory Li Jin Joe had to pay a very high price and after accumulating power for a long time finally decided to launch an invasion of the entire safe area in the southwest safe zone of humanity the plan is simple and brutal 50,000 demon beasts will directly parachute into the safe Zone intending to slaughter and seize control of the entire area Annie shell Wang already knows what is going on I have spoken every word correctly I don't know if you are satisfied if you are satisfied please reward me with another kick hearing this yiu was extremely angry 50,000 highlevel demon beasts are invading the southwestern safe Zone if I had not discovered them in time the southwestern safe zones would surely have fallen into chaos and turmoil as long as the demon beasts are not eradicated the hidden disaster will still exist but this time I must catch them all to eliminate the future threat Annie anxiously asked gwo we only have three people and we are on their territory how can we possibly defeat the demon Beast Army y Wu confidently replied using a small number to defeat a larger one we just need to use some basic basic tactics with so many demon Beast leaders they definitely cannot coexist peacefully do you know about gossip news for example disputes over territory or even competition for mates my tactic is to exploit these issues Annie was surprised do demon beasts also have gossip YW continue to explain trust me being gossipy is absolutely a trait of intelligent beings a person beside them laughed impressive this brother actually guessed it right it's true the gossip of demon beasts must be quite exciting Master just relax we will definitely report everything that should and shouldn't be said to you too so you say some things that shouldn't be spoken out loud M that's right this must be important intelligence I didn't expect both of you to have such strong gossiping Souls I am truly impressed after cha Wang said that he began to tell the two about lein Jael but speaking of it Although our leader is very power power ful he is also an incredibly stubborn and Bland person especially in this regard no one fears their wife more than him unlike other leaders who have numerous Partners our leader has only one beloved spouse however it is rumored that the lady finds our leader too dull and is having an affair with another leader he lowered his voice and continued moreover the person with whom the lady is having an affair is actually the leader from the other side his mouth is truly eager for some juicy gossip this this intelligence is indeed very hot and of high quality sha Wallen glanced around and then spoke in a hushed tone the faction of gwat leapard and ours once had conflicts over territory but he is very wary of the strength of my leader so he doesn't dare to confront him directly raccoon dog his subordinate is only at the second level of tupco 230 therefore he plays it sneakily deliberately seducing the leader's wife to provoke him sha Wang scoffed but my leader for the sake of face pretends not to know about this and is solely focused on invading the human world this state has been maintained for a long time I normally wouldn't dare to share these gossip news out of fear for my life but I can assure you this is absolutely true because I Am The Bodyguard of our Lord's wife wow the demon Beast world of yours is in chaos the conflict between the two sides arose because Li jingel was cheated on by gwat leapard he didn't dare to admit it no matter how powerful he is he is still being made Difficult by his partner furthermore even though GW Leppard's strength is not on par with li jinel he constantly provokes the other side relentlessly probing right on the line between life and death the two sides have always maintained this extraordinary balance haha what Wicked thoughts could Gio Jiao have now it must definitely help him to face that demon Beast who cheated on him dare to confront his partner dare to cheat the plan is once again again underway at the gang Jin tribes camp at this moment and Chang is talking to Li Jin ja those weak creatures who are able to dominate the world like humans should not have the right to continue living they still have a bit of value that is to become food and experience points for us ha those damn humans killed my sister since then my heart has died I no longer plan to be human but I truly do not understand your demon beasts so I still find it very hard to believe you I understand your feelings after all we are both robbed of the ones we love the most why doesn't she understand who truly cares for her you can rest assured demon beasts like us are not as complicated as you humans our demands are very simple first is strength second is a space to exist and third is to unleash our true nature do you truly understand these simple demands may only apply to you right I have listened to Yu's dialogue through the communication device I never expected that your strong robust appearance hides a man who is afraid of his wife our world is not small yet accommodating 28 tribes can feel rather cramped at first everyone could coexist peacefully and survive normally until hundreds of years ago the demon Beast Door located right in the center of the demon Beast World suddenly activated since its establishment the shifting door has always existed and we initially thought it was merely a totem or a symbol however on the day it unexpectedly opened countless demon beasts crossed through the door to reach the human world and we realized there was still a larger rule Beyond but after the first wave of demon beasts was defeated by some strongman of humanity the demon Beast portal closed again we had to quickly think of a way to reopen the door fortunately we eventually found a way therefore although in name the 28 tribes were still divided into four large camps in real two factions had formed one faction advocated invading the human world while the other defended their own territory who would have thought there would be a useless faction focused on defense as demon beasts we must overthrow Humanity seize their lands their seats and tables and plunder their resources if we do not kill and Rob what kind of demon Beast would we be indeed Heroes share the same perspective initially I truly did not misjudge anyone that is why I directed this battle for us demon beasts to become the rulers of Both Worlds suin came to say not good a person hurriedly ran over with news the Lord's wife has gone missing The Listener was startled what are you saying how did this happen why wasn't the lady properly protected how will I live without P Kei as he spoke Le Jin Joe angrily pulled the subordinate and shouted explain clearly what happened the subordinate terrified replied my Lord it was the lady who knocked me out because I carelessly overheard some secrets of the lady I I dare not speak further citing what she said what was it in the end the lady said that the Lord only knows about the power of War only cares about territorial expansion and does not pay any attention to her demands you are a useless person who does not know how to please a woman this time when you invade the world most of humanity will leave without returning the lady does not want to stay any longer hearing this he immediately threw a subordinate into the opposite door why why does it have to be at this moment py I have always hoped you would change your mind to realize who truly treats you well why don't you want to be the great woman behind me damn it he gritted his teeth and ordered transmit my order temporarily hauled the power supply to the demon Beast gate I have something important to attend to at jwat leopard's territory a panic subordinate rushed in senior senior not good Lou Jin Joe has brought people here aggressively killing right to the door someone said what did you say as soon as he raised his head he saw Le ging yelling fiercely that damn leapard I can usually pretend not to know anything but now at this critical moment you come to mess with me do you want to force me to act hand over my lady now who is this isn't he someone from our family you don't care about guarding your own door but you come here to spout nonsense damn you don't pretend to be confused in front of of me don't think I don't know about the affair between you two my wife sought you out merely a spice added to our marriage once she gets tired of it she will ultimately return to me and what about you you've thrown away the Dignity of the demon race yet in the end you're nothing at all what are you thinking what is your family various little rooms all kinds of openings all sorts of females every position no matter what you do it's just not enough to catch my eye oh that's right it's not me who seduced your wife it was she who actively seduced me she told me that you only know how to fight and be strong but you can't satisfy her I'm just helping you out aren't you grateful nonsense I would never willingly do something like that you dare lie me today I will kill your little cat and cleanse the humiliation of the demon Beast Clan just as Li jingel was about to act another person managed to intervene in time he frowned and said the guest room guest room level 260 wait a moment you can fight if you want but this matter has nothing to do with us don't drive us into your bloody dispute he continued his voice full of seriousness we are about to set out and yet you are ruining all the preparations for a trivial matter like this forgive us for not participating he took a deep breath trying to suppress his anger then shouted who at such a critical moment with morale running High you choose to engage in this ridiculous love rivalry it is truly meaningless another voice interjected laced with sarcasm let's go let's go damn it even I feel hot blooded here we are two great leaders fighting over a woman how ridiculous that person sneered and continued there are plenty of females and humans are delicious they are not something you can have every day isn't it better to focus on humans who is the true disgrace of the demon Beast Clan here leave ging listen to these words only able to remain silent he gritted his teeth cursing inwardly damn it it's all that damn leopard's fault for ruining my grand plan he looked at his wife his voice full of resentment my lady why did you betray me at the most crucial moment of my life at the same time on Yu's side he had used the spatial metaphor skill to conceal Li Jin Joe's wife a voice rang out from the other side p k level 150 who are you he said damn it what on Earth is happening I can't believe I was kidnapped by a human do you have any idea who I am to DARE Ambush me you got some nerve ha that's right that stupid dog led us to capture you and bring you here how Daring Do you really think you can do this to me what don't worry I just need you here for a while to complete my plan why should I obey a human like you do you really think I'm someone easy to bully I was just caught off guard and fainted because you ambushed me if we fought face to face How could a low-level human like you be my opponent go die but she hadn't even had the chance to strike before Annie swung her sword at her head silencing her damn it why does everyone want to bully me do you know who my husband is of course we know that's the only reason you hold any value for us and you still dare to lay a hand on me believe it or not my husband could wipe you all out with just one move is that so then try looking up at the sky your husband and his lover are too busy fighting over you they wouldn't have the time to take care of you here he said what you know about the situation between me and xia Wong he said so you want to use me to solve Discord among them in order to delay the attack on the human world right Madam Pig although you are hot-tempered you are not foolish you have directly revealed my plan in just one sentence hemp until now only demon beasts have looked down on humans I never expected to be underestimated by a humid today in fact it doesn't matter who looks down on whom but right now I am curious about the two fighting over there who do you hope wins the original wife or the new concin haha do you think I care I am completely indifferent to which of them wins or loses they are not to my taste da although strong is too boring and cannot satisfy my desires as for XA Wong while more and interesting he lacks strength and is just a fleeting nalty for me they are merely toys only waiting for me to grant them a bit of attention the person I seek must be both powerful and intriguing therefore I will not stop searching until I find a man who truly deserves it somebody said so is your condition and exception or is this the nature of your kind of demon Beast the gwat leapard laughed lightly and said kid don't use human moral standards to judge demon beasts like us what is called morality is just a constraint on primitive beastliness an attack on the Instinct for racial destruction therefore the number of demon beasts far exceeds that of humans proliferation is the fundamental way to continue our race he continued his voice filled with disdain you underestimate it too much it is indeed easy anger and somewhat uninteresting but absolutely will not ruin the grand scheme over trivial matters this is its strength your conspiracy will certainly fail haha over here the gwat leapard you to attack if you really want to make a move against me I don't mind playing along although I am not as strong as you I can definitely wear you out significantly by then the efforts you've put into the plan to invade the human world might turn to smoke what will you choose Le jingou was very angry but still tried to remain calm he thought to himself originally my lady already found me not interesting enough if the plan to invade the human world fails I'm afraid my lady would look down on me even more right now I must prioritize the overall situation this leeart although Fierce wouldn't dare to do anything to my lady after careful consideration Liu jino still decided to keep his composure he silently told himself this debt I will remember when I have dealt with humanity and returned Victorious that will be your day of death it will also be the day that my wife and I will mend our broken relationship saying this Li Jin Joe turned back to the demon Beast ignoring Gat liards continued boring taunts no wonder your wife wants to abandon you how could a rational person like you make her infatuated as long as I offer her the Delicacies of humanity and the comfortable territory of their kind she will definitely change her mind sooner or later she will understand my true feelings thinking of this Li jingel immediately sent a message down below request to increase the energy input of the demon Beast he was determined to in the human world as soon as possible and gwat leard sneered haha you little brat I told you your tricks are useless you will surely fail miserably you think I am here just to chat with you without doing anything elsewhere Yu had completed the installation of the explosives according to the plan gwat leapard was surprised explosives what's going to explode before she could process it a series of explosions rang out liou Ging ja looked at the Gate of the demon Beast that had just exploded unable to comprehend what was happening he shouted angrily what the hell is this who dares to do this I want to kill him standing beside him an assistant shook his head it seems like someone has destroyed the magic crystals draining the energy of the demon Beast Leu Jin Joo couldn't maintain his composure his eyes turning red with rage he gritted his teeth gwat leapard it must be him that Dan Lee part not only did he steal my wife but he also ruined the invasion plan with that Li Jingo charged straight towards gwat leapard upon encountering Him Li jingel shouted are you trying to Corner me failure of the plan and you take your anger out on me truly despicable you only have one wife yet she doesn't even like you how long do you intend to play the fool gwat leapard frowned barely having time to act before Li jino threw a punch at his face the punch was so powerful that it caused GW leapard to lose 20% of his health he clutched his face and cried out damn it are you serious not stopping there Li jino drove his Spear and hurled it straight at gwat leart the fire of Fury in his eyes seemed ready to burn everything down he said stealing the woman does not violate the laws of the demon Beast are you sure you want to fight me to the death even if you Creator Ruckus until the patriarch you still cannot kill me shut up don't act as if this has nothing to do with you not only did you steal my woman but you also offended the sacred taboo by destroying the demon Beast this act must be punished what I destroyed the demon Beast who are you slandering I admit to stealing your woman but I cannot bear the charge of destroying the demon Beast GW leapard spoke while dodging Liu jino's attacks with extreme speed oh I see your point I stole your woman but you have no way to deal with it so you falsely accuse me of destroying the demon Beast thus even if you kill me the patriarch will not hold you accountable this calculation is quite clever but I will not let you succeed at this moment gner leaper began the Counterattack you dare to quibble even when death is near the demon Beast absolutely cannot explode without reason besides you who else could have interfered clearly your intelligence is so lacking that you couldn't activate the demon Beast what does that have to do with me since you have decided to frame me I will no longer hold back my anger your nonsensical words and sophistry cannot change the truth go to hell as soon as they finished speaking both of them rushed into a fierce fight the demon beasts below also joined in the battle damn it although I don't know why our seniors are fighting but since they have taken action what are we waiting for let's kill them I've already found that this water tribe is irritating let's wipe them out hemp dogs of the anti metal tribe don't be too arrogant don't think you can easily Escape Brothers charge with me at this moment ye W stood by observing see those two are fighting to The Bitter End because of me and you think I would say something stop don't fight anymore dream on yiu sneered his eyes filled with disdain those two are truly foolish just for a tiny human like me they are being played like a puppet isn't this great he also watched the chaotic scene nodding in satisfaction them slaughtering each other like this is the ideal outcome just right for me to openly seek A New Path looking towards y wo she snorted coldly your schemes may work on them but they are completely ineffective against me you are indeed beyond my expectations but I do not like this kind of reaction do you want me to follow your wishes don't even think about it she said just a tiny human race do you really want me to listen to your orders the number of men I've played with is more than the salt you've consumed seeing her so stubborn Annie angrily slashed her sword straight into her back again if you want to kill me then aim for the critical point this kind of attack that doesn't hurt or itch is no different from scratching my back the girl let out a cold laugh and continued this sword strike isn't meant to take your life but to make you susceptible to poison so you can can work for us is that all a poison you can use you humans aside from your lowly tricks can do nothing else she smirked disdainfully poison has no effect on me you all should prepare to die as she spoke she transformed back into his species immune to all kinds of toxins y Wu standing nearby couldn't help but be surprised but maintained his composure he pondered no wonder she can control two powerful bosses like that her toxins really are ineffective a teammate reminded him Le woo you need to think of another way in our plan controlling her is an essential condition is there really no other option yugu side unless it's absolutely necessary I really don't want to do this saying that he summoned the demon of lust a seductive voice echoed has my master finally decided to call on me just tell me what you need and I assure you I'll make you satisfied Yu gritted his teeth you only need to controlled mind of this demon Beast P ke said this Pig's head is already filled with the aura of lust and controlling it is as easy as turning over a hand but Master what do you want to offer me in return even if you are the king of demons you cannot break the rules so what do you want very simple just let the master have some dealings with the lustful demon finally yiu was able to control Pai ha I finally dealt with this pig lady it wasn't N Easy at all Yu breathed a sigh of relief but there was still a bit of worry in his heart fortunately this time summoning the lustful Bean the world can still barely accept it if not just relying on a few women like this who knows what outrageous price she would ask of me Annie standing next to them laughed that's perfect but why do I feel like you're still waiting for a more outrageous price on this side Leppard's body could no longer endure he had only about 20% of his blood left gritting his teeth he shouted damn it if we're going to fight then fight why do you will me aim for my face pay Kai laughed her voice filled with teasing I'm not just hitting your face I also want your life as she spoke she delivered a finishing blow this move is the final strike do you think I can't fight you or run away from you sha ba panicked and shouted wait I'm going to report to Elder just as he was about to turn and run P key quickly flew over and him tightly shell ba are you okay shell ba said pag Kai why did you suddenly appear here he was surprised then struggled and said but let me go I have things to do right now P coldly turned to scold him Mr Jiao you beat sh ba up like this I hate you I truly like sh ba he is 10,000 times better than you even if I die I don't want to follow you anymore GW leapard Stood Beside mud did you hear that loser those words were like a knife cutting into Liu jino's heart shattering it he asked in a pain voice Peg key is that really all you want from the bottom of your heart pegi smir unhesitatingly replied of course moreover it's not just that the monster gate is also something sha ba arranged for me to destroy we want to stop humans from invading the monster world besides this crime will be pinned on you Le ging was speechless Furious P what what nonsense are you talking about when did I do such things P ke's venomous words added fuel to the fire igniting his anger 10,000 times more P if you don't love me then fine but why have you want to harm me to this extent fine if that's what you want I will fulfill your wish to be a pair of doomed lovers wait don't listen to her nonsense sha ba shouted loudly his voice filled with anger I don't know anything at all calm down don't fall for this bitch's trick he struggled to break free but the strength of the woman in front of him was surprisingly strong let me go why does this crazy woman have such great power I still have to report to the Elder I still want to live let me go you crazy woman the two of them continued to tug neither willing to let go in the midst of the chaos Lu Jin Jaa felt his head spinning why is this damn world treating me like this why he shouted in Despair and Chang sees the opportunity continuing to provoke you say monsters are very simple but compared to humans they are far more bloodthirsty even your own home situation you can't handle it so how can you deal with the greater issues after a pause and Chang coldly emphasized I never expected the monster gate to be destroyed in such a short time unable to attack Humanity anymore you have disappointed me greatly a person across from him sneered you don't get to teach me a lesson don't be too arrogant do you think the power you have today came from nowhere I certainly know the other person replied trying to maintain composure but do you think you can regain that power and chains words struck like a dagger the other person was stunned for a moment then withdrew the monster power from him why can't it a mocking voice echoed if you really want to try be prepared to face the consequences and chain shouted my strength has been drained how can this be you all are clearly so weak either living under my protection or relying on the opportunities and power I grant yet you all choose to stand against me very well all of you can die W Jin Joo roared crazily attacking and Chang at that moment Yu appeared quickly blocking the attack he said why let me tell you only by doing this can all my plans be perfectly completed finally and Chang returned to his human form however he was in immense pain a my body hurts so much his sister hurriedly comforted him hold on and Chang I will get you out of here has the final plan succeeded and Chang weakly asked this is the best outcome I could imagine Yu thought to himself after all even I cannot account for everything just ensuring their safe escape from here is enough leave Jin growled again humans Dare To Boldly invade the world of the superior beasts without fear of death is this really your only plan he spoke while delivering a powerful punch towards yiwu yiwu coldly replied no my real plan has already been accomplished saying this just to drive you mad liin Joe said I don't care what plans you have to me it no longer holds any significance right now I just want a little rage to unleash a massacre on these weak humans All of You Must Die although the other party didn't care yiu still shamelessly continued if you have sincerely asked the question I will demonstrate my compassionate teachings and tell you I didn't ask and I don't want to know a don't be so stubborn listening a little won't hurt after all I have time yiu said evading attacks continuing to recount the story to Leu Jin Joe now everything is clear what are your feelings hearing Yu's question he trembled and said you want to say that all of this was calculated by you and I'm following your script exactly are you joking in such a short time you have grasped my only weakness and devised such a thorough plan is this something a human can do impossible absolutely impossible you are insulting my intelligence that's for sure I would rather believe that the one I love has completely betrayed me than to believe that I am being toyed with by a human Li Jin Joe said haha is that your plan to break my mind how ridiculous you humans only have such Petty tricks in the past when we heard about Kings like Bayo being killed by a human we all didn't believe it we even mocked their weakness but now it seems that they didn't fail due to lack of strength but were instead caught in a human scheme that person is you isn't it it's just a Pity that your tactic doesn't work on me should I call you overly rational or so tormented that you've lost your mind whatever you say it is is that's how it is after all the final result benefits me I cannot deny that but thanks to you I have calmed down no longer as frenzy as before at this moment I have no weaknesses for you to exploit human it's time for us to fight with real strength now hurry up oh truly worthy of the monster cane your ability to self- adjust is indeed topnotch no no my strength does not lie in such tricks I will show you what true power is after saying that he swung the giant ax down directly at ywu causing him to lose 40% of his health ywu thought this source of power is completely different from before at first I intended to make him lose control completely but unexpectedly that action made him calmer I am currently at level 180 if I take into account the ability to fight above my level by an additional 30 levels it is still very difficult to win against him in a direct confrontation without using any other tr tricks system how many experience points do I have right now the system responded let me remind you last time the host used experience points to unlock five new accounts after that through multiple battles the accumulated experience points of the host have exceeded 2 billion 2 billion I didn't expect to accumulate such a gigantic amount of points but system is this the time to talk about trivial matters if I keep talking like this in the middle of a battle I might end up losing my life to deserve your dedication I will not use other abilities I have decided to use my first account to fight against you you should feel honored for it is you who has given me the opportunity to level up once again after such a long time leveling up and being able to choose for myself are you joking with me hemp do you want to use words to shake my mind it's useless let me expand your knowledge immediately yiu leveled up 10 levels currently his level is 280 at the same time the flames on his body transformed into a completely new form Yu looked at his opponent with sharp eyes a tense atmosphere enveloped the space are you serious yiu asked his voice full of challenge your power has increased by 10 levels or are you just trying to scare me Le Ginga roared his face angry yet wary do you think I need to lie to deal with you he took a step forward but his expression showed a hint of confusion as yiu smirked coldly let's see if that's the case yiu replied briefly immediately swinging his sword a sharp blade of energy sliced through the air aimed straight at Liu jingel realizing the terrifying power from the attack Li jinia quickly dodged to the side however his movement was not fast enough his large tail was cut off by the blade blood spraying everywhere ah my tail Leu Jin screamed in pain yiu sees the opportunity he continued to swing his sword each strike carrying a force that left his opponent trembling in fear the waves of Sword energy swept through the air so powerful that luu Jin jaao could only try to evade in chaos whether your power has truly increased by 10 levels or whatever you want to call it even if it's 100 it won't be enough to stop me y said coldly he Advanced each step slow yet filled with pressure Li Jin gritted his teeth his body now covered in wounds blood flowing continuously a low grunt came from him if you're not just putting on a show then is everything you've said true did you really orchestrate all of this Yu said nothing in response he raised his sword preparing to deliver the finishing blow at this moment Li Jin Joe's blood was down to about 10% enough to show that his life force was gradually fading y Wu wore a cold smile I have never lied no I don't accept this outcome this is not the truth the person in front trembled but still tried to justify this matter even if I don't want to admit it cannot be denied since the decree of invasion into the world began the fate of humanity has been predetermined yiwu quietly raised his hand sealing off the entire space an invisible barrier gradually surrounded them cutting off all Escape Routes the man shouted in panic are you trying to cut off all my means of retreat damn it even if I die I must send this information back to the Elder of the Monster World Humanity like you must not be allowed to exist as he turned to run yiu appeared right in front of him want to escape yiu coldly asked without hesitation he immediately sent him to his death the monster screamed in pain no despicable human the Elder will not spare you ywu shrugged calmly replied it's okay anyone who comes I will kill because I want to become the monster king after defeating the king level boss yiu received 20 million experience points and 5 million cash he also obtained an epic armor set forged from Titanium with an impenetrable defensive attribute this armor also had the ability to increase defensive Power by 120% the dragon bracelet uses the Horn of the final dragon forged into a bracelet within it hides an electric spark and this equipment can enhance overall resistance by an additional 30% the secret key is a key that can open the domain of monsters with this key one can go wherever they want in the territory free as the wind the 10 directions command Kang Jin symbolizes the leader of the Kang Jin Clan this is the symbol of supreme power in the territory capable of commanding and coercing all monsters under Liu jinel of the Kang Jin Clan when the spatial barrier was lifted the monsters began to rumble where's the boss why can't we see him could it be that human killed him hateful human Brothers Let's Advance we must take revenge for the boss another monster spoke up but he could even kill the boss I'm afraid he's very powerful what are we afraid of with our army of tens of thousands of monsters can we not defeat a single human kill him seeing the monsters begin to resist Yi Wu took out the 10 directions command Kang Jin he then used the pressure from it to issue the order forget the name Le jingel from now on I am the new king of you all immediately all the Kang Jin Clan monsters knelt down a monster said that Humanity the new King in hand is the command token of our Kang Jin Clan King long live long live the damn Kang Jin Clan is worshiping a human don't interfere with the drama run quickly that guy killed Jin Jiao he's not something we can touch hurry report to the Elder seeing them about to run to report yiu immediately ordered Kang Jin Clan kill all of G water liards leave no one alive yet King receiving yiwu's order all the monsters of the Kang Jin Clan immediately charged forward to attack Yu stood High commanding the legion calmly but with great Authority Kang Jin Clan listen to the order our infantry speed up intensify the attack forward crush the enemy's defense line the launched magical attacks from a distance aiming directly at the enemy's defensive structures breaking the communication within the enemy formation our infantry quickly moved from both flanks completely encircling the defense line cutting off the enemy's Retreat harvest the heads not a single one is allowed to escape under Yu's command the enemy's GW leapard Legion completely fell into a weak position one of the enemy ranks desperately shouted damn it today I realize apart from my king the strength of the Kang Jin monsters completely crushes us right one monster exclaimed these are all the new command methods of arcan in the past our combat was all Reckless how could there be such a tight structure as now the new king is truly amazing I've long been fed up with the idiots of the Jiu Clan today we can finally overthrow them in a refreshing way it feels so good damn it hang Jin Clan do you really want to wipe us out still calls it the Kang Jin Clan anymore I have changed Clans now under your wise command and divine Marshall prowess the trash of the guu clan can't withstand a single blow please tell us what should we do next withdraw the troops back to the territory all right did you all hear the command filled with the Majesty of our box like a Celestial being sound The Retreat clear the way H wait withdraw it feels like something is off I always feel like we've forgotten something but the descendants of the Jiu Clan have all been killed right what else is there to do if we don't withdraw ah makes sense return return then this battle was much easier than imagined haha that's true I also feel like there's something not quite right the wolf stood thinking what exactly went wrong what did we intend to do from the beginning I remembered it and then forgot such an important matter the female owner suddenly did not know where she had gone currently only the mail owner remains I have no other choice therefore I have to make him comfortable and obedient I was really too careless as a wolf such an important matter almost slipped my notice you have received the jishui secret key since I did not personally defeat jishu can I only obtain the territory key well never mind now there is something more important The Treasure of gioo is unattended I must quickly take care of it using the secret key of Kang Jin the system open a teleportation passage to the Kang Jin territory for the host this is Jojo's residence you all seem rough but your construction technology is unexpectedly impressive the wolf said boss you flatter us too much we are still far behind you in every aspect however our Kang Jin Clan excels in weapon technology and equipment training even leading among the 28 Clans therefore the headquarters is built in this volcanic area to facilitate itate Alchemy and forging y Wu said in that case The Treasure of Jo Jo must be storing many rare weapons and equipment he Master Annie you have returned Shia Wang has only not seen you for a while yet it feels like several autums have passed when will you spare some time to reward me and give me a little kick ye woo and chain he is still unconscious and hasn't woken up I will take him to rest first once everything is settled I will come find everyone boss xia Wang let me show you around your residence first no me he said to save time let's go straight to the treasure in The Treasure of Kang Jin as soon as they entered y Wu quickly put all the treasures into the space system jaia Wang initially intended to guide the boss around the estate helping him pick out a few beautiful women as partners unexpectedly the boss refused not wanting any women and focusing on serious matters sha Wong was surprised and admired boss is truly a Resolute person I admire you like the river's currents flowing endlessly in the treasure you have acquired 58 rare material processing devices 365 types of tools not even leaving behind a needle or a thread xia Wong side boss truly lives up to his name I understand now you must be reminding us not to indulge in past achievements and resource accumulation we must continue to strive and begin stepping into a higher future ye w do not pay much attention to XA Wang's words his eyes lit up with excitement is there that much we're getting the jackpot Gio Joo don't worry I will protect all your Treasures he checked the only Divine level item he had obtained this time the teleportation magic Crystal this item could separate fragments from the magic Crystal allowing for free teleportation between two magic crystals regardless of distance or space Yu couldn't help but be amazed damn it JoJo you even had something like this you used this before to locate and infiltrate the nine Zone with this my plan to enter the universe will be greatly supported this is awesome a moment later at an Chang's Place Yu frowned his face full of worry damn it why is it still not working I've tried all kinds of herbs but still can allev it and Changs pain the medicine isn't effective is it he looked at in Chang it seems he's not only suffering physical pain but we all know the cause what should we do now Annie panicked and pleaded why woo please find a way you must save in chain suddenly sha Wang interjected speaking respectfully boss mistress Annie perhaps I know the reason but I kindly ask mistress Annie to reward me a little Yu frowned you understand speak quickly the wolf said a master step on me step on me stop down hard on me it is this power it is this feeling that rushes straight into my heart numbing me master you truly understand me hurry up and speak yes his state is likely due to being cursed by a certain type of curse and furthermore there is no antidote what you say there is no antidote Annie don't be anxious let it finish speaking this type of curse in fact our Kang Jin Clan all possess however it usually will not manifest it will only activate when someone betrays or separates from the clan when he returned from the monster state to human form it also meant that he had separated from the clan and his power this curse will not be fatal in the short term it will only render him incapable of action but it is not resolved quickly he will eventually die there's only one way to break it what is it and the asked urgently the origin of this curse is related to King long Elder a being said to exist at a level even higher than the 28 constellations that Elder seems not to be simple therefore the next boss will likely be determined by anchang senior's power Shawan do you know anything about the elders intelligence suddenly anchang opened his eyes his gaze seemed completely controlled by someone he chuckled softly and said there's no need for such trouble if there's anything you can just ask me directly wouldn't that be better and Chang said just a normal human yet able to stir up the entire Monster World and reach this level even I cannot help but admire and Chang what's wrong with you a person asked and changen was taken aback his face darkened why am I suddenly saying such nonsense he paused in selfquest and Chang is the name of this body how can this body withstand my power without falling apart could it be this is the perfect vessel immediately and Chang felt uneasy a Tremor Rose in his mind has this body been taken over by another Force powerful energy surrounded him he thought in this world who could be strong enough for this if I had to guess it could only be the king long Elder in the distance a short man yelled in panic Elder please spare me I'm about to be crushed by your pressure saying that he repeatedly knocked his head pleading another person could not hide his astonishment is this the power of the king long Elder I have truly never encountered a monster pressure like this before at this moment anchang was completely controlled by the king long Elder through a strange curse the Elder's voice echoed in in Chain's mind human do you really think you can run rampant here don't be so mave my eyes see everything I know everything you do the king long Elder laughed loudly the fact that you have made it this far is merely because I wanted to see your capabilities haha to probe me you didn't mind sacrificing both Kings but it seems you still do not understand my nature and Chang said weakness is a crime those kings like them are not only more foolish than humans but also weaker unworthy to live in the world of monsters you are merely helping me clean up that pile of rubbish what is there to be proud of he continued if you can kill them then it proves you are kuuan wo according to what that human said as long as you don't eliminate the great ambition of monster evolution for a day I will not be able to advance you dare dare to voluntarily come here how can I just sit idly by this body has great potential enough to withstand my golden and silver forces so let's use it to send you to your death after finishing his words he immediately unleashed the king long to attack Yu to his surprise yiu was unable to withstand this blow and lost 40% of his health the white flash flanges that ywu unleash could not even stop the shrieking sound of King long ywu gritted his teeth and thought is this the power of the Stellar Elder he smirked his voice filled with disdain I originally intended to kill you with just one move I didn't expect you to endure it quite interesting then let's see how many more moves you can take perform well don't disappoint me saying this he pulled out a strange Branch the branch swiftly extended wrapping around Yu pulling him toward himself as if wanting to drain Yu's life force Yu thought I guess his true level must be around 400 moreover a formidable Elder like him has three others I think could the monsters really be this simple here with the sealing of all powers I can barely win against him but what about the other three they are surely paying attention to this battle the most dangerous issue right now is that I have no way to use my ultimate techniques otherwise no matter how outstanding and Chang senior is at winning he wouldn't survive either it's really difficult seeing y wo only dodging and not counter attacking he mocked not bad for a move but I can sense the hesitation within you you are afraid of harming this body aren't you truly foolish to the extreme clearly you are struggling to save yourself yet you're worried about external things human beings like you are truly a complex Twisted form of garbage you only deserve to become nutrients on The evolutionary path of our Monster Race to Massacre the world humanity is just a stepping stone for the grand performance as he spoke he Unleashed a thunderous blow stray at Yu's head faced with such a level disparity if yiu did not utilize other Trump cards it would be hard to avoid severe injuries in this situation Annie suddenly appeared creating a protective shield for yi Wu and trying to wake her brother and Chang wake up you absolutely cannot be weak like this didn't you say you wanted to kill all the monsters to atone for your sins then why now do you want to add more sins Annie warned you have to be careful no sooner had she finished her words than a bolt of lightning struck directly at Annie fortunately she had a fairly sturdy armor otherwise she would have lost her life however a cold voice echoed from within that body you the sister of this body the sentimental sibling show is indeed boring for humans unfortunately this body no longer has any memory of you no matter how much you scream it's useless this body has been occupied by me and and it will never return to what it was haha just as he was about to run towards yiu Annie immediately flew over tightly embracing him she continued to desperately call her brother back I know everything deep down you have always hated me at the most crucial stage of your life I was not by your side I left you to grow up alone and that is my fault but from now on I will always be by your side even if it means searching for death together and Chang said his voice full of anger enough what is this filthy girl babbling about this cheap sentiment has no meaning I am nothing to you the reason I didn't kill you before was entirely due to my contempt for your strength now that you have actively sought death I will fulfill your wish go die when he was about to strike Annie and Chang unexpectedly regained control over a part of his body he shouted loudly sister stop anyone who dares to touch my sister I will kill them and Chain's words shocked even King long Elder he exclaimed how can this be even my curse can influence Consciousness yet a mere human can break free from it and Chang coldly laughed his gaze Resolute this is thanks to you my body not only withstood your power but you also touched upon my weakness now the memories I lost have been fully restored and the first thing I want to do after regaining them is to eliminate all the Hybrids those who harmed my sister an it was moved tears welling up and Chang it's so good finally you are sober each of an Chang's words was like a blazing fire signaling that a fierce battle was about to begin and Chang a senior restoring his memory is a good thing but how long as Consciousness can remain clear is still a mystery I must prepare to cope you should not rejoice too early it is just a momentary Clarity of Consciousness this body I am the one in control your weak and laughable consciousness Disappear Completely in the past my inner self was weak and Confused always wanting to rely on external strength to become powerful as a result everything always went against my wishes but now it is different the only person I cherish is everything to me she is by my side and from now on I must rely on my own strength to protect her Your Own Strength how ridiculous a voice echoed do you not realize how weak you are if you were truly strong WR you would not have to submit to the power of the monster look as soon as I leave your body for a moment you will revert to the image of a useless person as before right after saying that and Chang used his own technique to countercontrol no it can't be clearly I have detached from your body how can you still use my strength moreover you are using the exact same ability as me and Chang stared into the void his eyes calm as if recalling the past he said I told you it's all thanks to you you awakened my memories including the painful ones that I had deliberately tried to forget whether it was the fears I hid deep inside or the true strength I refused to face suddenly Annie exclaimed in panic and chain could it be that even that memory has come back to you and Chang smirked faintly and said yes it is because of this uncontrollable strength that I ended up killing my own parents in in Chang's memory his mother's gentle voice echoed I'm sorry the business deal this time is very important for the family to bring this shipment Into the Wilderness your father and I have used all our savings to hire security there's really nothing left to hire someone to take care of you at home your sister is off at school so your parents can only take you with them his father's voice followed filled with encouragement look at how you speak our cha Chang is a boy there's no way he'd be afraid of the Wilderness furthermore I've been down this road many times before it will be fine the child in the memory exclaimed wow is this really the Wilderness it's so vast in the future I want to help transport Goods with my parents too his father laughed hardly ruffling his hair see I told you our XA Chang is far from being afraid of the Wilderness a monster spoke up you all say I am a monster that doesn't follow the normal path usually I go out of my way like this but now haven't I met humans I ask you are you impressed by me before the family stood a wild level 40 monster I'm very impressed today we must have a hearty meal we're done for it's a monster we are being ambushed by a monster you two stay put in the car I'll go lead the bodyguards to fight back ah damn it what is there to fight back against a monster of this level is not something we can deal with The Bodyguard said as he ran away XA Chang listen to me no matter what happens you must stay in the car mom 'll be back soon as she spoke the level 20 mother stepped out of the car blocking the bodyguards who were about to flee she yelled we paid a lot of money to hire you for protection but when trouble arises you all run away first do you still have any Spirit of keeping your contract one bodyguard replied his voice full of boredom get out how much is that Spirit worth is it more important than our lives you can wait to die saying that The Bodyguard immediately moved his hands knocking the down to the ground shout chain it's okay just leave everything to Dad now close your eyes no matter what you hear do not open them promise me okay in an instant and Chang's father was stabbed through the body by a monster right in front of him what bad luck I've been hungry for so long finally encountered a group of people but unexpectedly There Are No Children damn it I really want to eat some kids I was too excited just now the mother on the other side was not any better being chained by another monster until she died facing the pain that the monsters inflicted on his family and Chang albeit only at level one was not afraid at all he crawled out of the car and shouted loudly you monsters let go of my dad and mom sha chain run away quickly hick sha Chen don't look back just run Straight Ahead Dad and Mom will catch up with you later and Chain's whole body was sh at this moment but he still replied firmly I can't do it I'm very weak and I have many illnesses I can't run far and Chang thought I always imagined myself as a hero in the battle team someone who could protect my parents but I'm sorry I am not the main character in this superhero story right now my greatest courage is to face death alongside my parents I am not afraid at all if I must die I am willing to die with my parents sha Chang no before the words were fully spoken and Chang was pierced through by the monster hemp human kid you've grown up the monster that stabbed and Chang was a rare elite a level 50 ghost claw armor it mocked where's the fear without these flavors even a human child loses half its taste what a Pity wait boss another monster spoke up there's something off about this human kid what's up with this state and that level at that moment and Chang was no longer level one he had become an Chang level 51 a level one human child in an instant was on par with their boss what's there to be scared of it must have used some kind of item to deceive us watch me kill it but before the ghost claw armor could finish its words it was pierced by anchang strike and died on the spot the boss angrily exclaimed this little human brat has completely lost his mind just as he said and Chang had killed the entire group of level 40 Wild monsters with a single blow leaving not a single one alive all around the ground was littered with the corpses of monsters alongside the bodies of En Chain's parents one creature spoke up its voice dripping with disdain a human monster like you is not truly human you dare to kill your own parents compared to us you are the real monster and Chang was taken aback staring at the aftermath of his actions he murmured dad mom what what have I done how did everything end up this way I only wanted to save you a faint memory suddenly surged into his mind and Chang gasped as he realized no this is the memory I've forgotten all this time so it turns out this is the source of my strength so it really is like this Annie said after the tragedy the rescue team from the safe Zone examined the bodies of all monsters and humans aside from the wounds inflicted by the monsters they also found other injuries seemingly caused by a human child in the investigation report a shocking conclusion was recorded not ruling out the possibility that the human child had killed them all because of the scene there was only one Child Left Alive subsequently rumors of inchang killing his parents spread rapidly however I still can't believe that it's true when enang woke up he had completely forgotten that segment of memory an he said moreover it's like becoming a completely different person from a SI an arrogant young master I have turned into a healthy individual who always smiles but lacks my own identity it's all your fault you are just avoiding the truth although you don't believe this is real deep down you still Harbor resentment towards me you deliberately distance yourself from me unable to Face Reality together haha I understand now you truly are a failure you can't even control your own strength your ability to absorb and replicate is merely my Doppel ganger power it is still far in ior to my true strength and Chang said but that is already enough my power not only absorbs and replicates the level or strength of the opponent but also their emotions and personalities that is the real reason behind this tragedy perhaps Heaven is mocking me turning my life into a tragedy from the very beginning but now when I am completely awake and still alive I must use this power to atone even though it still has negative effects and I cannot fully control it I must find a way to suppress ress it King long replied haha I know why Li Jin jaao allied with you because compared to other humans you are even colder and more ruthless just like us monsters to win are you truly willing to retrieve power that has already killed your parents without saying another word and Chang immediately crushed the neck of King Long's clone I never denied this but from now on my coldness and ruthlessness will only be directed towards monsters and Chang sides softly and continued after you learn the truth you will surely hate me even more sister I have no right to ask for forgiveness but I hope you can give me a chance to atone for my sins Annie looked at her brother her eyes sparkling what are you saying you are my only family why would I hate you upon hearing this and Chang couldn't help but rushed to embrace his sister tightly I'm sorry sister truly sorry but rest assured from now on I will definitely protect you well I won't let you be heard again Annie gently responded her voice filled with emotion silly it's me who hasn't protected you well enough but it's okay from now on no matter what happens we will face it together as siblings if our parents are watching from above they will surely feel happy this is truly the day of our reunion as siblings but one standing beside them witnessing this scene smiled softly I am truly happy for both of you and Chang and Chang said V woo thank you if it weren't for you my life would likely still be filled with sorrow perhaps This is Our Fate together right but right now we are still on enemy territory the Urgent task at hand is to quickly eliminate all monsters that's right and Chang I once encountered a boss in a dungeon that only used half of its power so does that mean your power is similar no it's not just using half of my power absorption and replication is a unique class of power my strength has not diminished it has only increased this means I can simultaneously possess two abilities indeed but the external absorption ability can only exist as one type this means that the later absorption ability will overwrite the previous one despite any negative effects of this ability I no longer think of myself as the protagonist of this scenario that's true y woo although I only absorb the power of an elder at the 200 level I feel that his true level must be around 400 he is that formidable so it is best that we avoid him for now what we need to do is to attack the 28 constellations y w said now that you two have formed an alliance you can completely crush the boss leader I don't need to worry I will act alone moving over to the faction that protects monsters to lure them moreover you should take the treasure ticket from that bastard to supplement your equipment and weapons then hide in the surrounding area of the war faction's territory wait for my command and only then take advantage of the opportunity to act all right I will follow everything you say whatever you arrange we will do it that way we will always trust you xia Wang who is the leader of the monster protection faction you truly live up to your reputation immediately asking the crucial point the leader of the protection faction is the ghost golden sheep who is in the second group under suzaku although I had never heard of this Leader's name as he rarely shows up but based on the internal information shared by the brothers guarding his gate the ghost golden sheep is the first Monster to achieve leadership in the 28 Stars he is really powerful almost comparable to the four Elders the internal information from your brothers is indeed interesting the monsters are increasingly surprising me completely different from what I used to know yiu said now let's go learn more about this impressive leader the ghost golden sheep the monster said Master it is right here my brother is inside the gate I told him about your desire to meet his boss and unexpectedly his boss agreed directly at the king's gate sha Wong was chatting with the gatekeeper monster hey buddy I'm here let me introduce you to this guy my new boss with an impressive Aura a total badass and a special rank hearing xia Wang's words the gatekeeper showed an annoyed expression quiet my king doesn't like noise if you want to enter do it quickly I'm here to serve my master not to chat about personal matters Aya brother you're still as conservative and serious as ever lighten up a bit but this time I really have to thank you I didn't expect the king to agree to meet a human like me however more than half of you will probably go but not come back he said while showing a contemptuous attitude towards yo shall Wong was afraid y Wu would get angry and quickly said hey hey Master you must not take it to heart my brother is actually worry about me he just doesn't understand your strength and reliability Yu calmly replied it's fine do you know if this ghost golden sheep has any more in tell yiu said the road to this residence is all concealed documents this is completely inconsistent with the Primitive beastly image of monsters in my perception Master had your gossipy Soul admed again this ghost golden sheep among the multitude of Kings is truly one of the most mysterious figures rumors about him are very few and even when they exist they are not many as I mentioned earlier it is known that he is currently the leader of the conservative faction however it is said that he was once a ruthless figure in terms of Slaughter continue this ghost golden sheet Rose to the position of King by killing countless people in competitions it is rumored that he was the first king under the command of the four elders and is a long-standing existence like a war god in our demon tribe it was from the ghost golden sheep that the position of King was established with each Clan only being able to be led by the strongest member of the clan it can be said that the rules to become one of the 28 Kings and that qualification were entirely set up by him alone the strange thing is ever since the ghost golden sheep became king he quickly went into hiding this is also why there are so few rumors about him ye thought a king like a war god it seems that if the negotiation does not succeed it will likely turn into a brutal battle I must prepare early at this moment they had arrived at the room of the ghost golden sheep as soon as the door opened he spoke humans you finally came I have been waiting for you for a long time the person in front was a subordinate of suzaku the second monster ghost golden sheep level 360 upon seeing him xia Wang immediately knelt down and bowed he trembled and said Master Shia Wong kneels before you please show me mercy the energy emanating from the ghost golden sheet was terrifying even Yu had to exclaim though this Aura of malice is not offensive the invisible pressure from him makes others sense real power this is a true strongman yumu thought to himself he has reached level 360 this exceeds expectations he feels like a scholar but this does not diminish his danger the ghost golden sheep holding the book in his hand hand coldly said Bay a Thunder Demon Lyn shun youu Li Jin Joe and gwat leart the five Kings either directly or indirectly have all died at your hands furthermore you have forced our elders fragment soul to retreat humans like you are merely pray for us monsters to trample upon yet this time instead you have caused chaos making it impossible for us to have peace y Wu calmly replied if you have investigated so clearly why do you not strike at me the ghost golden sheep said Humanity why must you test me like this if you have chosen to come here and talk do you not understand my attitude I have long forgotten the feeling of fighting and killing moreover formidable enemies are endless even if we were to kill them all new strowman will emerge killing only leads to an endless cycle of tragedy only by continuously seeking the truth in books and gaining Knowledge from countless ancient texts can we find a way to break this deadlock hearing him speak this way yeu was surprised so even monsters can achieve such powerful strength and calmness of mind you replied candidly I will not hide anything my goal is singular to stop the monsters from attacking the human world right now I want to cooperate with the conservative faction of course if you refuse that is fine I just hope that while I and the other kings are engaged in battle you will not interfere after hearing this he closed the book and responded it has been a long time since I have met someone as confident as you however your strength indeed matches that confidence every era is not lacking in the emergence of stman both humanity and monsters alike Humanity I acknowledge your strength and can agree to this request but at the same time you must fulfill a requirement of mine as he spoke he handed the book in his hand to Yi Wu speak if you have any requests feel free to State them don't rush before I present my own request I ask you to patiently listen to a story from my past I once Rose to become a king through Bloodshed but later I lost my motivation and goal to move forward by chance I once had the opportunity to engage with the history of monsters and since then I have been captivated and unable to restrain myself this residence is actually a massive Library I am the manager of this place and this is also my domain within this field everything serves me including the knowledge and wisdom contained in the books based on this Library I have studied and discovered that the civilization of our monsters developed very similarly to the civilization of your humans it's just that we monsters often express our desires directly while you humans bury those desires deep within initially the Two Worlds had no connection at all but later they were linked together thanks to the monster gate according to the oldest ancient texts I have found even when monsters had not yet evolved into a civilization the monster gate had existed long before that therefore I suspect that a higher Dimension has deliberately placed it here he continued when the monsters discovered that the other side was the world of humans they immediately manifested what is called monsters evolving again needing to handle Humanity to reach God but I believe that the evolution of monster species does not need to borrow external forces because this method of evolution is merely an endless cycle of mutual aggression if we continue developing like this we will sooner or later become play things in the hands of the Void tides of monsters this we absolutely cannot allow to happen therefore my request is simply that I hope you can destroy all the sources of this conflict hearing this yiu cly said is that all you want destroying the monster gate is not difficult I have previously destroyed part of it before y wo could finish its sentence the other person interrupted no you underest estimate the monster gate it is a presence belonging to a higher spatial tide with protective rules and restrictions if you do not follow the rules to destroy it it is impossible to truly annihilate it I have destroyed it before but very quickly I witnessed it repair itself with my own eyes after saying this he waved his hand a door of a mechanism opened revealing fragments of world Stone from the world Stone he continued in the past few years after reading many ancient books I I've discovered that to completely destroy the monster gate a key artifact is definitely required upon seeing the stone yiu was taken a back and exclaimed isn't this the world Stone the other person smiled oh you recognize this Stone it seems I didn't misjudge you Yu nodded but hesitated that's right this is the world Stone but what purpose does it serve the other replied with a profound look that's right that's right you are also a person of knowledge and wisdom according to my research on the human world both humans and monsters possess this Stone but do you know what it is used for Yu thought to himself clearly the person before me is very powerful but compared to external strength he valued knowledge more this made him somewhat intrigued after a moment yiu responded to be honest I'm not quite sure the other did not seem surprised I can't blame you after all you do not have a library feel like mine where one can absorb a vast amount of knowledge if the monster gate is considered a rule then the world stone is what breaks that rule what you need to do is help me find the remaining pieces of the world Stone to utterly destroy the monster gate at this moment yiu was truly astonished by the function of the world Stone it turned out that the legend that this Stone could break the rules was indeed true if enough World stones from Humanity were gathered it could truly restart the entire world the G golden sheep continued the world of Monsters has been shattered into 28 fragments each held by a king this place is merely a battlefield belonging to 10 fragments of the anti-war Arena as for the remaining 18 fragments you must defeat the other kings to seize them however this process will undoubtedly be very challenging especially with the four Elders they will not sit idly by hearing this I responded it's just a coincidence I had originally intended to defeat the other hearing you say that it seems like a killing two birds with one stone currently I have killed five Kings and acquired their territory Keys thus I now possess five Stones I believe you can deduce some Clues from this in fact the invading kings in the human world do not have a high rank this is because low-level monsters consume less energy when Crossing through the monster gate their primary goal is to deal with humans to gather more energy preparing for the invasion of higher ranked Kings therefore the situation in the Monster World will not be as comfortable as before I advise you to start attacking the lower ranked kings first to avoid being besieged by the higher ranked Kings in a desperate situation upon hearing this yiu immediately refused that would be too Troublesome can you provide me with more information about the king long Elder hearing Yi Wu say that he was a bit startled you don't intend to directly take action against the Elder do you for humans to do so would not be a wise move Yu smiled and replied don't worry I'm not the type who doesn't know the sky is high and the Earth is vast I just have different calculations you just need to tell me everything you know the other person SED all right using you is no longer in doubt since I've chosen to invite you for support I should trust you King long Elder has extremely powerful strength even though it ranks second among the four Elders its level has reached the Beast Clan level 420 it is among the more aggressive of the four big Clans also a ferocious existence I have been patient with the sole intention of invading the human world but with your current strength you absolutely cannot defeat it no matter what calculations you have I advise you to avoid directly clashing with it upon hearing this y also felt somewhat cautious level 420 huh previously we were too conservative in evaluating its level although I have faced opponents much stronger than King long multiple times in the Divine realm that was due to the particular effects of the dungeon terrain now I wonder if my means are enough to deal with King long Elder y Wu thought to himself it seems that King long Elder is indeed the most difficult enemy to deal with this time for now it's best not to provoke it after thinking for a moment Yu continued I am very curious even King long is ranked second then who is ranked first ghost golden sheep replied suzaku it is at at the top King long is second white tiger is third and Shuan Wu is fourth this is the ranking order of the four Elders hearing this yiu was surprised suzaku is actually at the top does that mean its power is even stronger than King long ghost golden sheep shook his head not exactly the combat power of suzaku is actually not as strong as king long but it possesses a unique and Superior ability reincarnation upon hearing this yiwu was even more astonished reincarnation ghost golden sheep explained hundreds of years ago King long challenged the four Elders to dominate the world white tiger and suan Wu quickly lost only suzaku continued to fight against King long when King long exerted all its strength and killed suzaku it thought it had won and could claim the title of King but a miracle occurred suzaku completely resurrected while King long at that time was exhausted and had to kneel down and beg for forgiveness ghost golden sheep continued I have studied suzaku's ability for many years combined with a large amount of ancient documents about monsters in the end I have reached a conclusion although it has not been proven suzaku has an opportunity for reincarnation every few hundred years therefore it is likely that he still has a chance to come back to life y Wu thought to himself this is the key intelligence if I don't know about this when the time comes I will use all my strength to fight suzaku and kill it but the opponent might directly revive with full health which would truly make me want to explode both physically and mentally knowing the ranking strength of the four Elders Yu decided starting with Swan wo the one ranked last after all I have long held a grudge against it hundreds of years ago yiu had a confrontation with Swan Wu once but at that time xan Wu did not take Yu seriously yiu told himself a wise move Al Oak Swan wo's level is not much lower than mine the reason it became an elder is for a reason it has nearly Invincible defensive power thick skin and tough flesh making it very difficult to break through its defenses unless I have an attack power at the level of King long Yi Wu confidently said you can rest assured I will think of a way saying that the ghost golden sheep handed him a magic Crystal and said this is a magic Crystal that can communicate with the kuwan Wu Clan after you defeat the Kuan Wu Elder and possess the king retrieve the world Stone I will give you the magic Crystal to communicate with other clans and the rewards ye wo suly thought is there still a reward then I must demand a valuable one when the time comes he coughed a few times quietly reminding himself that the influence of the greedy demon was growing stronger after that he continued there is one thing I I am very curious about do you really believe everything I say without any doubt you trust me like that aren't you afraid that I am using you to achieve my own goals hearing this yiu calmly replied it's fine as long as the destruction of the monster gate is real I don't mind temporarily being your Pawn after speaking Yi Wu Turned and Left sha Wang asked anxiously Master are we really going to kill Guan Wu Elder Yi Wu responded his tone steady yes who told him to have a bad relationship with me but you don't need to accompany me go back to Li Jin Joe territory I will make you the vice King Shawan was moved and said Master you must be the angel sent by the Heavens to save us monsters in this life being able to follow you is the greatest blessing for me master your power is unparalleled you will definitely suppress this Monster World while XA Wang was continuously flattering yiu suddenly felt someone was following him someone is coming moreover it seems like they do not have good intentions Yu stopped his sharp gaze fixed who are you the Assassin held two short daggers in his hands and charged directly at yiu growling just a mere human yet you dare to be arrogant and you even want to kill Guan wuo Elder you're not qualified ywu easily dodged his attack and swiftly tore off the Assassin's cloak so it's a woman he exclaimed exit my sheep level 200 ye W raised an eyebrow your name can be translated as happy beautiful sheep judging by your appearance you must be a subordinate of ghost golden sheep right she replied coldly our boss may be gentle but we his subordinates are not you're about to die why ask so many questions as soon as she finished speaking hexi my sheet lunged behind y wo attempting a fatal strike however y Wu instantly countered slashing her and sending her flying backward yugu smirked his voice dripping with contempt a mere level 200 dares to show off in front of me truly ignorant of your limits he stepped forward his tone lowering I have important matters to attend to anyone who stands in my way will die but as a favor to your master I'll spare your life just this once remember that shi sheep glare at him her eyes filled with Fury how can he be faster than me no he's far faster than I am grinning her teeth she spat who needs your mercy filthy human yiu didn't respond he simply turned and walked away the monster spoke master that woman is still following us she truly doesn't know what's good for her let me take care of her as long as she doesn't interfere with my matters I don't mind but honestly with her level she shouldn't be able to beat you anyway Master the monster continued its tone slightly agreed while while that might be true the way you put it is a bit harsh I was just trying to show a little loyalty that's all Yu replied calmly all right enough you head back first we have more important matters to handle Yes master may your Marshall skills flourish and may you always emerge Victorious with that Yi Wu proceeded toward the teleportation gate leading to the swan wo Clan his thoughts darkened as he stepped through asterisk suan wo clan master isn't it back in the safe Zone you treated me with disdain like I was an ant Beneath Your Feet your arrogance was endless but now the ant you once despised has come knocking at your door to face you head on NIS as Yu entered the Kuan Wu territory hexi my sheep trailed close behind I don't mind having a fan following me Yu muttered without turning his head as long as you don't get in my way but hiding after being discovered this Beast doesn't seem too clever woo that was was close I almost got caught Yu took a few more steps before his path was suddenly blocked by a labyrinth that materialized in front of him the entrance to the kuuan Wu territory is a maze clearly designed for defense preventing outside enemies from invading Yu chuckled to himself how interesting but it's useless against me I already have a navigation system he called out come out true eyes immediately this eye activated and mapped out the optimal path to navigate through the maze according to the guidance yugu only needed to follow the Flames Trail to get out however after taking a few steps he unexpectedly encountered a dead end Yu frowned navigation failure how could true eyes lead me into a dead end no this maze definitely has something unusual about it he thought for a moment and then decided if the conventional methods won't work then I'll break the rules in play right after ywu activated his demon wings and intended to fly over the maze but as he ascended he hit an invisible barrier causing him to be pushed back to his original position he smirked so I can't skip the Maze and fly over it it seems this maze really has a special mechanism with renewed determination yiu declared if that's the case I'll destroy it and clear a straight path forward saying that yiu swung his flame sword aiming directly at the wall of the maze to slash but the wall seemed utterly unscathed by his strength at that moment a familiar voice echoed although you humans have some skills you are too straightforward only knowing how to be tough your Reckless slashing is useless while strength is necessary it is not absolute there are many things in this world that cannot be resolved with power alone hearing that y Wu turned back and replied you must have been following me from the beginning not just to watch my foolishness right she thought to herself no way doesn't he only have power in his mind could it be that he has seen through my purpose I clearly intended to tease him a bit longer how embarrassing it wasn't because I wanted to help him or anything just passing by who would have thought it would coincide like this Hayes forget it no more pretense it truly was a moment of good intention seeing him unable to leave the kuuan Wu ma made me feel compelled to remind him a bit Yu asked seriously so please tell me what is happening hexy May appearing smug replied hemp begging me is the right move this is the attitude you should have all right then I will be generous and tell you she said this maze was created by xuan Wu using a very rare and Powerful type of artifact this artifact has the ability to bypass levels even King long the Elder with the strongest combat power cannot break in Yi Wu curiously asked this is the first time I've encountered a rule artifact however if it belongs to the same type of rule it should be similar to the rule of the fog Palace right the other person replied to pass through this maze you must break the rule but until now no one has managed to do that the only one who could see through the truth had not finished speaking when Yu interrupted it's you right you look so smug you must have found a way to break the rule haven't you the other person sulk why do you always interrupt me this is truly the most rude thing I've ever seen I originally intended to say it to scare you but now look what happened the girl pouted drew a circle of curses and declared I curse you Yu laughed this little sheep is so amusing as an assassin you let all your thoughts show on your face this personality seems completely contrary to your profession after thinking for a moment yiu reassured anyway as long as you're not lying then you're still very powerful she said that's a given in the past I just didn't dare to speak it out but today I finally caught the chance to pretend once haha Master she's not lying it's just that this monster makes me a bit confused if you say she's stupid then she can solve the maze if you say she's smart everything shows on her face I think you specially came here to lead the way right go ahead and state your conditions damn it you saw through be again you're just too smart being like this isn't good you'll miss out on a lot of fun in life you mean that foolish youth is much happier right who are you calling foolish furthermore according to the standards of our monster Clan I'm not even at the youth stage yet I'm a young girl got it a young girl sorry sorry whatever you say is how it is hexi my sheep continued it's very simple to bring you through this maze but you must agree to take me with you to Kuan wo I'm going to killed Jan Wu do you also have a grudge against it at this point hexi my sheet became extremely ly angry Kuan woo that black turtle has killed my entire family in the past to climb to the position of Elder it used countless tricks and murdered many people she said although killing is the Instinct of the monster tribe I can never forgive it no matter what my tragic story is quite long but specifically like this before she could begin to tell yiu interrupted sorry to cut in but please don't start reminiscing I'm really in a hurry just knowing her true purpose will be enough I will meet her request let's quickly get through the maze while talking hexi my sheep glared at y Wu you really are despicable unethical unethical can't we talk properly a little later kxi my sheep LED Yu away but her mood looked very down Master a voice rang out based on the color spectrum of emotions I deduced that her current mood is very low to facilitate getting through the maze I think you should find a way to comforter Yu sighed and then turned to ask may I ask how to solve this maze as soon as the question was finished exide my sheep's sad expression vanished that's right that's right I already said it how could you not worship me haha this cold demeanor of yours can't be faked anymore she said this maze is essentially a defensive mechanism of swan Wu as soon as the territory detects someone who has not been recognized byan wo the maze will automattic atically activate this maze may appear frightening but in reality it consists of just a series of simple rules following conventional methods for solving it you only need to find the accurate exit however even if you follow the best route it takes at least 5 days to completely escaped the maze hearing this Yu was quite surprised even the best route takes nearly 5 days then how long did it take you to solve this maze the other person chuckled lightly and replied not much just over 100 years why are you like that why aren't you going upon hearing the figure over a 100 years yiu fell silent seriously saying I apologize for interrupting your memories you are willing to pay the price of a 100 years to solve this maze to seek revenge for your family with such heavy determination I am rude but I can assure you I will definitely kill Guan wo The Gaze of Yu when saying these words exuded a terrifying murderous intent yet it made a girl heart flutter the other person laughed softly teasingly saying why are you being so serious all of a sudden you are really a strange person all right I'll forgive you is that enough she thought although he is human seeing his serious demeanor is actually a bit handsome and just like that yiwu's Haram officially gained another member at that moment ywu suddenly hugged exi my sheep from behind making her extremely flustered hey you what do you want I just forget gave you and now you're doing this how can you be like this let me go you leous scoundrel that's I my sheep paused for a moment but then her thoughts began to spiral wait that's not right it's not the mating season yet why is he suddenly acting like this could it be that it's not a physiological issue but a psychological one does he really like me she continued to overthink could a Forbidden Love between a monster and a human really begin like in the Legends how Terri Ying if we have children will they be monsters or humans which naming tradition should we follow this is so annoying I'm thinking too much I need the game to help me think this through while T my sheet was still daydreaming ye Wu unfurled his demonic Wings held her tightly and flew into the sky walking too slowly my flying speed is faster you just point the way and I'll lead you oh okay tathy my sheep replied but in her heart she felt a twinge of disappointment exim my sheet walked while thinking with a formidable enemy ahead what am I thinking about she told herself if I were to blame anyone It could only be this person for being so strange finally going out the next day but you really are impressive the journey That was supposed to take 5 days has been shortened to just one day thanks to you texi my sheep turned to ask Yu by the way I must be quite heavy right you've been flying with me all day don't you get tired yiu smiled and replied no problem you're not heavy with my stamina I can carry you while flying as long as I need to heide my sheep looked at y woo thinking to herself so powerful and so caring I've never met a human like this before the two flew for a while when the scene before XI my sheep surprised her that is the monster arena of Tuan woo I've heard that this place is used by xuan Wu to select the king Clan once you step inside only the Victor can survive and leave she spoke up it seems the person we are looking for is likely fighting for their life here Yu nodded looking ahead that's right xuan Wu level 340 is waiting here just then the surrounding monsters began to stir as y wo appeared the monsters said haha they have arrived they have arrived the two lost goats have finally made it here a mocking voice rang out I really have never seen swan woal take action personally these two little goats are about to be beaten to Smither oh dear I hope they don't die too quickly our brothers have waited so long to witness the great power of swan Wu Elder another voice echoed that's right you are the first ones to solve the Lord's maze it was faster than I expected as soon as I learned that you humans entered the Monster World I had a feeling we would have a grand battle Among Us xan Wu sneered and continued in any case I have long since probed your strength but what surprises me is that the one who unraveled the maze is a little female goat This truly vexes me this Arena was originally meant to select a can and yet I must humble myself to deal with you you should feel extremely honored at this moment haimi sheep was so angry that she was trembling she shouted directly at Swan wo Swan woo you black turtle do you still remember hundreds of years ago when you and the suzaku clan had a great battle it was because of you that my family was all killed in that war he said haha what are you joking about killing is the nature of monsters in the past I have killed many of my kind because you are too insignificant I completely do not remember who you are however since the monster gate was opened and Humanity appeared we monsters have stopped killing each other what about you you do not stand with your kind Against Humanity but instead lead the enemy you are a traitor a shame to Monsters the surrounding monsters began to mock in unison despicable truly despicable traitor shame of monsters shame on the whole clan hearing their taunts taxi my sheep couldn't hold back any longer and charged into fight wait someone tried to stop her but she brushed them off I can't wait I have spent hundreds of years for this day this Grudge I must personally repay even if there is no Hope of Victory even in death I will not be ashamed of my family the opponent coldly laughed you can be considered to have some blood of the monster Clan but it is useless but we die as light as a feather and are not worthy of being remembered just like right now if I kill you a moment later I will forget you as he spoke he punched ta my sheep hard sending her flying straight into the opposite wall her blood volume was down to 3% he scoffed coldly a weak goat like you doesn't deserve to be my opponent he step forward his gaze full of disdain swap places with me human from before if it weren't for you I would have long since taken control of the human safety zone you ruined my plan you shouldn't understand the consequences by now right as long as I kill you my plan will have no more obstacles he paused for a moment his voice laced with mockery this time you brought yourself to my door if you have any ultimate skills use them quickly no matter what you'll die a miser death anyway Yu said nothing and immediately activated the chain flame Emperor striking with great force but that strike only caused his opponent to lose 5% of his blood volume he laughed loudly full of contempt an attack that barely tickles is counted as a blow perhaps I have overestimated you from the very beginning having said that he violently swung his tail sending Yu crashing into a wooden beam Yu bitterly laughed this old black turtle is indeed tough as Sati my sheep once said Chan wo may be the lowest rank among the four elders but his defensive power is truly formidable Jan Wu glanced at ywu his tone filled with mockery filthy human can you even do anything it turns out you're just a weak Bookworm only capable of enchanting women with your looks huh if you can't do it then hurry up and kneel down begging for mercy he burst into laughter the sound echoing with a threatening Aura ye Woo is changed accounts and the system announces that the account Immortal bald head has been activated har saitama officially makes his entrance at this moment the surrounding monsters cannot help but discuss hey look at that human he suddenly turned golden haired but why do I feel he's not as strong as before another monster gleefully replied haha you don't understand I once visited the human world and know their thoughts this guy is trying to turn into a girl hoping that Elder xan Wu will go easy on him treating him as a female and sparing his life everyone burst out laughing but just then Jan Wu slam down with a sneer oh so that's how it is unfortunately our monsters and your humans have different morals I kill without distinguishing between male or female yo not letting his opponent look down on him coldly retorted trash have you said enough right now I'm very excited and just want to use my fist to smash you to death as soon as the two attacks clashed Jan Wu instantly lost 20% of his health this left the observing monsters gasping in astonishment they exclaimed in astonishment what how can this be one person in the crowd exclaimed in shock the Supreme defense of swan Wu Elder even King long who is considered the strongest has to exert a lot of effort just to break through it damn it who is that long-haired girl I can't believe she managed to overpower Guan Wu Elder to the point where he has no strength left to resist at this moment Yi Wu continued to unleash a flurry of punches on Swan Wu the onlookers couldn't help but be stunned is he really that strong even King long couldn't break through the layer of swan Wu's armor so quickly could it be that his human strength surpasses even that of King long another voice rang out no that can't be he must possess some kind of special power similar to how I possessed my extraordinary defensive abilities xuan wo gritted his teeth his gaze turning icy I never expected to be pressured by a mere human to the point of having to use my final killer move having said that he drew forth at kuam woil merging it into his body normally I would never want to use this Divine artifact once I activate the absolute defense I will become invincible but doing so would take away all the fun Yu continued to strike relentlessly but suan Wu's defense remained utterly unshaken xuan Wu scoffed do you still not understand all your attacks against me are completely useless he exclaimed Humanity you are indeed very strong but unfortunately you have made a mistake that mistake is opposing me as he spoke he threw a punch that sent y wo crashing into the wall he continued no matter how sharp the spear is when it meets the toughest shield in the world it can only be helpless are you ready to die but what he did not expect was that Yi Wu was completely unscathed by this punch yiu smiled coldly his gaze iy as he looked at his opponent he scoffed although my rank is perhaps not even comparable to some Lords I can sit in the position of Elder certainly not by luck my tactics are extremely diverse and this absolute defense is just one of them even so with your strength it seems you will have no chance to learn more about what I possess Yu did not say much but continued to charge forward and threw another punch yet this strike was still completely useless hemp you still have the strength to resist he frowned his voice full of disdain human you truly exceed my expectations but my absolute defense cannot even be broken by King long and suzaku what do you think you could do after finishing his words suan Wu immediately used his knees to attack repeatedly causing Yu's blood to drop to 48% Chuan Wu said you are still not dead but that doesn't mean you have any ability it's just that I haven't played enough yet I want to see you struggle until you are completely desperate Swan wo continued to throw punches at y Wu while laughing heartily his face filled with delight I can kill you anytime I want but I prefer to savor the joy of crushing my opponent an observer shook his head and said haha damn it just watching makes me feel the pain if it were me I'd rather commit suicide than take such a beating another person chimed in but let's be honest don't you think this human kid is quite good at enduring hits he's been getting beaten by the great Elder yet his HP is dropping surprisingly slowly the first guy mocked h no matter how good he is at taking hits it's no match for absolute defense as long as his health keeps going down he'll be tortured to death eventually the first one frowned but it is true that this kid has some skills however the more he resists the more painfully his end will be time passed and half an hour later xan Wu was still relentlessly pounding Yu as if he wanted to crush his opponent kid you really are better at taking hits than I expected Shuan wo snorted coldly but I no longer have any interest this is just so tiresome at that moment Yi Wu unexpectedly began to speak starting a countdown from 10 Jan mus his voice dripping with sarcasm oh so you finally decided to say something is it because you've sunk into Despair and are counting down the time to your death one person said I've told you this kid's resilience is really impressive he has been tortured On The Ground by great Elder xan wo for half an hour and yet his blood has only decreased by 10% another replied but what does that matter he is exhausted unable to fight back and can only passively endure the blows soon enough he will have to say goodbye to this world someone chimed in let's go from the very beginning this battle has leaned towards one side it truly isn't interesting at all although it has taken a bit longer than expected it shouldn't be coming to an end now just as Stan wo launched his final punch y Wu unexpectedly counterattacked damn it am I seeing things one person exclaimed in panic that kid dared to take the attack from great Elder Swan wo another interjected calm down this is just the excited reaction of a human before death I have killed quite a few of them and I've seen situations like this a couple of times however Yu's punch was disbelief for everyone it not only reduced Swan Wu's blood to 10% but his arm was also completely shattered Shuan Wu screamed in panic my my arm one person was astonished what just happened it seems like great Elder Swan wo's arm exploded I even heard it scream others said is this also a part of reflective backtracking but where is the absolute defense of great Elder Swan wo what's going on I feel that if this continues our great Elder xuan Wu will die Juan Wu was in pain how is this possible how could you break my absolute defense impossible absolutely impossible y Wu chuckled lightly this is also thanks to exi my sheep that you have underestimated at this moment YW suddenly recall the conversation with heide sheep earlier right later when you battle with Tuan wo you must be careful he has a Divine artifact called absolute defense you w wondered absolute defense just hearing the name is enough to understand that this artifact can nullify all attacks hexi my sheep nodded exactly but if I dared to go with you to kill him I must have prepared a way to deal with it y Wu raised an imro really clever so how did you do it hexi my sheep explained this is something I had leader goat demon helped me with for a 100 years in the end he created an artifact capable of countering absolute defense while Kwan Wu uses it this magic Crystal will absorb the energy of absolute defense however theoretically this is the case but this artifact has one critical problem Yu was curious what is it hexi my sheep replied it takes 30 minutes to charge fully exi my sheep continued even the other three great Elders cannot withstand Swan Wu's Championship stake for 30 minutes so this item is considered useful but it cannot be easily used today you met me so you have found the right person of course my meeting with you is likewise a stroke of luck for both of us this is fate xim muu replied hemp so before you were just purposely stalling for time allowing me to beat you for half an hour y Wu laughed smugly that's right I was putting on a show for you you he roared you vile creature both you that damned woman and the goat demon must die I will tear you apart drink your blood and eat your flesh great Elder Swan woo one of the group spoke up this human speaks without reason you should Retreat and heal so we can help you deal with him as soon as he finished speaking the 80 level guards rushed out to attack but were immediately wiped out by Chuan Wu who needs your help anyone who dares to look down on me Must Die human do not rejoice too soon I have said before absolute defense is merely one of my tactics my true power is far greater than you think with that he punched down hard causing the lava beneath to churn and erupt violently the ground trembled violently the temperature rising yiu was astonished lava this scene feels somewhat familiar suddenly the ground shook again with a fierce Tremor it turned out that Swan wo had activated his ethereal protective State rising to level 380 his blood and magic power stats returned to 50% Shuan Wu continued his voice full of challenge I haven't used this form in hundreds of years human you have forced me to use this technique even in defeat you should be proud y Wu cly replied so that's how it is you are using the lava to enhance your strength but unfortunately for you I still have many tricks at my sleeve he scoffed then added since when can a loser be so proud upon hearing Yi Wu's words suan wo became Furious and attack with his tail Yi Wu remained undaunted retorting stop trying to intimidate others who do you think you are I don't believe you have as many tricks as I do believe it or not it's up to you after saying that Yu activated a new form an intense heat spreading outwards xan Wu stared in shock at Yu's new form unable to believe his eyes what this extreme heat power you have to try it to know just a mere human how could you possibly possess such unmatched strength y Wu raised the spear High into the sky and said next I will use this familiar trick to send you on your way onean woo in pain exclaimed originally I thought that the four Great elders and I were the heads of the world beings like deities in this realm but now I have come to realize how lowly I truly am just what kind kind of existence have I collided with uh uh I have trained hard for many years collected countless life protecting artifacts yet I have lost in the blink of an eye I truly cannot accept this Yi Wu continued successfully defeating boss Twan wo you earned 20 million experience points and 12 million enriches chaotic maze a divin level artifact appears this is an indestructible area and anyone who enters without the acknowledgement of the art artifact's owner will be lost forever additionally absolute defense a divin level artifact can nullify all attacks from opponents once activated the absolute defense State lasts for 1 minute and the cooldown time is 100 hours finally the order of the Marshall Clan Chief containing the Supreme will of the noble Clan cannot be refuted this Authority allows the forc command over all Lords under Kuan Wu's rule there is also Black Rock Sania a legendary level defense defensive tool boasting superlive defensive and resistance capabilities once equipped it increases defensive Power by 150% and overall resistance by 60% y Wu continued the spirit snake medicine is refined from the Venom of the tail of swan wo this is a type of medicine that has the ability to negate all poisonous effects but the user will fall into a state of weakness and confusion for a short period of time at this moment the five subordinates of Tuan wo he also appeared even witnessing it with my own eyes I still cannot believe that a human could kill Guan Wu great Elder even he a season one could not help but be terrified how could such a powerful being emerge from the human race which is deemed weak these subordinates were as follows the third limb mad subduing hand the fourth limb day rat the first limb D mui the sixth limb Pig strong the seventh limb wallat transfer report as soon as Yu saw them he said when I engaged in battle with Swan wo I vaguely sensed your existence now your leader has been killed by me do you want to come up one by one or all at once hearing this the first limb stood up to respond I do not quite understand you have defeated Zan Wu great Elder and moreover obtained the clan leaders token so you could easily compel us to obey your commands why then do you still choose to confront us you just gone through a great battle are you truly confident enough to take on Falone y Wu confidently replied Clan leaders token I can certainly use it but I want to use strength to convince you so you cannot say that I only know how to use schemes while lacking real power I want you to listen to me wholeheartedly because I am someone who intends to become the monster gay dumuk C then responded several hundred years ago the great Elders also dreamed of uniting the Monster World becoming the soul cane but they all failed in the end the Monster World could only be divided into four parts yet you a mere human dare to dream of accomplishing what is inherently impossible why y Wu while picking up XI my sheep cly said I haven't ask for your opinion I'm just informing you right now you have two choices either come here for me to fight or kneel and submit to me immediately the five of them fell silent then simultaneously rushed down toward ywu Yu thought to himself it seems they intend to attack together good this will save me time however things did not unfold as Yu thought they unexpectedly knelt down before him one of them spoke up we do not wish to confront you we are willing to submit to you now let's stop the nonsense and just fight Yu was taken back wait a minute what did you just say submit you are submitting so easily dumi replied we have witnessed you battle against the Kuan Wu great Elder with our own eyes your impressive combination of intelligence and bravery has left us deeply moved never before has there been a person as formidable and admirable as you in fact our monster Clan and humans have never had deep-seated conflicts the act of devouring humans was only intended to become stronger and to evolve however even so we still cannot Prevail against outstanding individuals like you if you lead us we are ready to grow even stronger along alongside you furthermore we assure you that from now on the monster Clan will completely abandon any intentions of invading the human world wallat transport continued indeed regardless of whether other clans agree or not we will stand by your side henceforth we will be your most loyal supporters after saying this one of them smiled and added the Supreme King please accept this fragment and the Insignia from the five of us these are the symbols of our lordship only by offering you these two items can our loyalty be fully expressed Yi Wu happily accepted them smiling in response then I won't be polite anymore I never expected to receive these World Stone fragments so easily the first limbs Solly added the Supreme King in the upcoming battles we can help you delay the Lords of other clans however we truly lack the capacity to deal with the great Elders that task can only be handled by you yourself ye woo immediately ordered that's enough you all go back to your territories now I will call for you when I need you upon hearing this all five Lords replied in unison yes after finishing their words they returned to their own territories monsters were truly not complicated the strong commanded obedience these Lords were all intelligent people at that moment hexi my sheep had opened her eyes and woken up she immediately jumped out of Yu's Embrace panicked and shouted Chan woo where is the old Swan woo Turtle we have to be careful that old Swan woo turtle is not ordinary what happened here why is everything in Ruins seeing her anxiousness ywu calmly explained you missed quite the show I have eliminated Swan wo furthermore the other Lords have pledged their loyalty to me hexi my sheep widened her eyes in disbelief don't joke around with such absurdity just handling Zan wo is already extraordinary the other Lords did not take the chance to attack during the chaos and yet they are loyal to you Yu did not say another word he only took out several tokens and fragments upon seeing them kekai mayik was stunned her mouth and Gap in astonishment what the heck is this damn these are kuuan Wu tokens and the Lord's tokens so what you're saying is true how did you accomplish this immediately she ran to HUB Yu's legs tears streaming down her face wah hundreds of years hundreds of years my great Revenge has finally been Avenged W I couldn't even make any contribution i' just arrived and collapsed yet still we triumphed little brother no master you are truly a blessing in my life I am really very grateful I am willing to dedicate the rest of my life to follow you to toil and serve you Yi Wu helped her to her feet gently saying I don't mean a maid I still prefer your unruly demeanor from before besides you are not without your usefulness if you hadn't given me the tools I wouldn't have been able to come here nor could I have broken Swan whose absolute defense right at this moment in sa's eyes the man before her was truly unbelievable how could someone be both powerful and humble at the same time it truly couldn't be more perfect she silently thought oh my God my heart is dead I have fallen in love while she was still lost in thought you wo had already walked ahead a bit he turned back and said let's go we should return to goat demon hexi May immediately responded okay from now on regardless of east west south north wherever you go I will go there too I Will Follow You ye wooo helplessly thought to himself this woman is she ultimately smart or foolish it's truly hard to understand a few hours later at the goat demon Mansion the Dorman happily exclaimed isn't it y wo my Lord You've returned you just fought your way back from Swang wo and managed to subdue the Lords with great difficulty I will immediately lead you to meet the Lords please follow me this way and be careful not to slip seeing the respectful attitude of the doorman Yu couldn't help but be surprised he thought to himself the attitude of this gatekeeper is completely different from before as if it has turned to full 180° it seems the intelligence network of goat demon is indeed extensive even air Dorman knows about what I've done in the Kuan Wu territory at this moment in the room of goat demon the conversation began although I sent taxi my sheep to assist you to be honest I didn't set my expectations too high I didn't expect you to actually succeed and moreover to subdue five Lords at once I have always considered myself to be very prudent but this time I must admit that I could not have predicted your potential be so profound I had some doubts about you before but now I am completely convinced y Wu replied calmly I understand after all mere words lack persuasive power everything must be proven through strength at this moment the goat demon handed guwu a Divine artifact the pisses J pendant he explained this pendant can be pressed against the heart to separate a counterpart of the opposite gender the duration of Effectiveness is 1 hour this is to express my sincere gratitude and hope for cooperation this is a very valuable Divine artifact and I hope you will accept it Yu frowned and asked why are you giving me such a strange thing the goat demon laughed and further explained killing Swan wo will definitely alert the remaining three great Elders next you are likely to face the white tiger great Elder this artifact will be very necessary because the white tiger is not just one person more precisely it is two individuals a man male and a female separated from a single body upon hearing this Yi Wu held the badge in his hand and thought to himself it seems I cannot Escape the Fate of becoming a female body after all at the same time in the territory of the white tiger the leader of the white tiger level 380 was deep in thought as his subordinates reported Kuan Wu is dead we have confirmed this is true monkey monkey level 320 continued that person named ywu not only killed the Kuan w great Elder but also recruited all the Lords of the Swan wo Clan under his command he has even allied with the goat demon I predict that his next Target will likely be our white tiger Clan the next members of the white tiger included koi mu Lang level 300 Lu Jin goo level 250 stomach Feit level 190 bayu Wu Level 240 monkey monkey Level 310 pad's chicken level 100 pl's chicken expressed concern and asked so how should we respond to this the patriarch looked at his weak demeanor and spoke is there really a need to be so afraid ple chicken retorted angrily what if I'm weak this is the Kazan Wu great Elder we are talking about he was killed and you expect me not to be scared monkey monkey interjected I feel that we need not worry too much no matter how strong Yu is he is ultimately just one person as long as we gather together we won't have to fear Him k Lang added that's right Shuan Wu lacked intelligence trying to Bear everything alone is what got him killed we will not step into the same trap stomach feasant stated although the GOP demon has allied with Y wo he has not given his partner a single soldier clearly being somewhat cautious BYU Wu concluded in the end he is just a Human After All not enough for us to fear he continued could it be that he wants someone to destroy the entire Monster World hearing his sub ordinates chatter like that white tiger shouted angrily you useless Bunch shut your mouths at once the whole group immediately knelt down patriarch please calm down patriarch please calm down white tiger said I warn you all never underestimate our enemies our white tiger Clan is only of mid-level strength in the entire Monster World we have no Capital to be arrogant understood everyone replied in unison yes White tiger continued that y wo can continuously defeat many of our clansmen like this so it can't just be luck it must be based on strength I believe his true strength is absolutely not limited to what he has shown he surely has hidden cards furthermore the enemy is not just him alone the king long patriarch once secretly told me that there are two other humans assisting him one of whom has an extremely bizarre ability that can even defeat the soul of the king long patriarch upon hearing this all the subordinates were extremely shocked white tiger went on that is not the most important thing the most important thing is that the vice clan leader has still not been found monkey replied there is no trace of the vice clan leader he has completely disappeared my subordinates sent to search so far have not sensed anything male tiger thought it's been 50 years where could you have gone he pondered only you and I the two of us together can un bleach our true power because you are not here I cannot participate in the invasion of the human world nor can I take a further step to enhance my strength today that y woo came knocking at the door can I withand it alone having thought that he commanded his subordinates to intensify their search no matter what you must find her for me the root knelt down we obey at this moment in goat demon study Yi Wu was still researching information about the Monster World meanwhile goat demon approached from a distance and asked do you need to rest to recover your health I have arranged for you a space that is absolutely safe and free from disturbance y replied I am still young so there is no issue regarding my health however I have some questions I want to ask you goat demon answered please go ahead Yu said I need intelligence regarding the Blood Demon Crystal previously you mentioned that highlevel monsters require a corresponding highlevel quantity I I have seen some monsters using Blood Demon crystals to supplement energy for the Blood Demon crystals is there a connection between this GOP demon glanced at Yu with a Discerning look and said no wonder you are remarkable you can pinpoint The crucial Point At a Glance this is related to the fundamental secret of the monster Clan which should not be disclosed to you however to express my Goodwill revealing it solely to you is not impossible the goat demon continued The Blood Demon Crystal has always been the source of all energy and power in the Monster World since ancient times since our Inception the Blood Demon Crystal has existed and spread throughout the world according to the records of the prehistoric monster ancestors they stumbled upon the primordial Mind Of The Blood Demon Crystal and it was this that helped the clan evolve develop Advanced intellect and Achieve civilization however it also made them more aggressive and bloodthirsty nevertheless with the progress of time the monsters in the Clans today have abandoned traditional methods and are no longer strong thanks to the Blood Demon Crystal after all the growth rate of the Blood Demon crystal is very slow however by a stroke of chance we discovered that monsters invade and devour Humanity after coming into contact with the Blood Demon Crystal when the Blood Demon Crystal comes into contact with human blood it absorbs it causing the Blood Demon Crystal to become full and Powerful for this reason it has been used to open the doorway leading to the Monster World the various Lords of the clans all use this Blood Demon Crystal to become powerful but I still insist on using the primordial Blood Demon Crystal to develop our race although its Effectiveness is inferior to theirs it is safer and more stable Yu thought to himself this Blood Demon crystal is undoubtedly a hidden disaster before confronting the white tiger patriarch I must go investigate a bit on my own directly asking the goat demon may not be very appropriate this individual is not simple I must think of another approach thinking for a moment Yu pretended to be tired half suddenly feeling a bit sleepy he chuckled lightly and said you just said your energy was fine and now you want to take a rest lead Lord gu Wu to the room to rest upon hearing this hexim my sheep immediately replied yes she led Yu into a room that had been prepared in advance the Run was completely isolated from the outside atmosphere appearing very safe after finishing the Arrangements hexi my sheep returned and said if there's nothing else I will take my leave now however just as she was about to leave Yi Wu unexpectedly grabbed her hand saying wait the sensation of being held startled xim my sheep thoughts filled her mind with excitement he why is he holding me back could it be that he can't control himself anymore does he want to do that right here in the Stillness of the night with a male and female in the same room Flames could easily catch from dry straw the images in ximi sheep's mind kept her heart racing but what you wo said next completely deflated her do you know where the original magic crystal mine iside my sheep hesitated I I don't know I really don't know anything at all hearing her hesitating tone Yu thought to himself no need for a lie detector I already know you are lying then he said don't worry I won't tell anyone just lead me there and I will fulfill one of your wishes how about it rest assured I just want to take a look I won't do anything Kai my sheep replied but that place has the bloodline of our monster except for the great Elder no one dares to approach hearing this yiu took out the great Elder's token and smirked then it's easy I have the kuuan Wu token so I can act as a great Elder isn't that legitimate she thought to herself his words are quite reasonable and I can't refute them moreover if I can get him to agree to help me after thinking she said hey all right I agree but remember to keep your promise youu frowned thinking why do I have such a bad feeling about this a few hours later hexi my sheep led ywu to the place of the Blood Demon Crystal you guys are here to devour and transform human blood energy isn't that enough hexi my sheep urged that's close enough didn't you say you only wanted to take a look you've seen it all now let's go home however instead of leaving Yu approach the largest Blood Demon Crystal directly x i my sheep panicked hey hey don't act recklessly you are a human aren't you afraid of being turned into a Blood Demon Crystal stop right there Yu replied that's not right the strength hasn't been drained instead it's surging into my body powerfully suddenly the space around yiu transformed as if he was in outer space he exclaimed in surp surprise is this the cosmic Essence but it's flowing into my body as if everything is pouring in what exactly is this it's the host body's monitoring system recording the influx of immense Monster Power while simultaneously activating the special account of the golden dragon physique you who gasped what the Golden Dragon physique account refers to the ancestral Monsters the Primal monsters in ancient times extremely powerful beings had undergone a catastrophic battle the Golden Dragon fought to its last breath exhausted its strength and died later its body transformed into the world of monsters currently the Golden Dragon physique account can only be used when the Monster Power has been replenished to a specified level at present it has been replenished by 15% you w thought an elder of the monsters this account is so interesting this kind isn't strong enough what should I do to replenish the monster power for this account I can even either defeat the monsters or have the monster Overlord incapacitate them to absorb their strength or directly absorb the monster power from the Blood Demon Crystal ye W wondered why didn't I unlock this account sooner I had killed so many monsters before surely I could have filled my energy up directly by now but now that I'm here I can't miss this opportunity otherwise it would be such a waste upon hearing y woo xim my sheep began to think wildly you you want to pluck my wool no you can't do that at least not here y Wu chuckled softly extending his hand to touch the Blood Demon Crystal and said I mean plucking sheep wool here right immediately Yi Wu absorbed all the power from the Blood Demon Crystal the force was indeed very powerful no wonder those monsters always ran after like ducks after absorbing a large amount of Monster Power Yu's current energy had reached 60% yiu thought good at this I will definitely reach 100% energy before facing King long let the dragon recharge you monsters teach you a lesson while pondering Yu suddenly notice something strange in this cave a bizarre Aura seemed to emanate from deep within the cave Yu turned to HEI my sheep and said follow me I feel that there is something very dangerous inside hexi my sheep replied all right even though she felt very scared there seemed to be some sort of power in Yu's words that made her unable to refuse what is happening this is the bloodline power from the monster ancestor account low-level monsters often cannot help let obey Yu's commands he smirked looking at teai my sheep and asked don't you want go back now hexi my sheep replied hesitantly with you protecting me I'm curious about that strange Aura a few minutes later they arrived at the source of the peculiar Aura before them was a surprising sight y Wu exclaimed this isn't this the white tiger great Elder inside that Blood Demon crystal is actually the ancient split body of a white tiger that the patriarch has been searching for 50 years Yi Wu frowned wondering I clearly remember that the white tiger patriarch has two forms two personalities so which one is this haide my sheep replied it must be the female but why is she here this is so strange hearing this yiwu became in intrigued and smirked forget it sooner or later I have to fight with the white tiger if I can separate and defeat each part wouldn't that make it easier suddenly sax my she pugged Yu from behind her voice filled with concern don't act rashly this situation is too strange we should Retreat first moreover the female of the white tiger Clan is much more powerful than the male you absolutely should not underestimate her y Wu scoffed but deep down he began to consider exy Sheet's words really could this actually be Tigress while they were still hesitating The Blood Demon Crystal suddenly shattered a pure white figure fell out from it it was the White Tiger great Elder Yi Wu mumbled staring at the broken Magic Crystal oh no why did it break so suddenly suddenly he remembered could it be that the act of absorbing power from earlier has inadvertently caused this thinking about it ye laughed and charged forward a great opportunity take advantage of her weakness and strike to finish her off Yi Wu thought so and prepared to rush into attack but just as he got closer white tiger suddenly opened her eyes and let out a fierce Roar yiu was sent flying I didn't expect her to wake up so quickly the Roar of white tiger K like a direct blow to the soul causing KY my sheep to freeze in fear immediately white tiger lunged forward with shark claws aiming to attack XM my sheep in an instant Yi Wu quickly switched to the account of the Chen Emperor and rushed to Shield xie my sheep be careful go I will hold her back XI my sheep flustered replied yes but you must be careful white tiger wasted no time using her foot to knock guu away however as soon as he hit the ground yiu bounced back with high speed striking hard at White tiger's head yet white tiger tiger speed far exceeded Yu's expectations this Chen Emperor account seems insufficient to face her headon white tiger not only possessed Superior strength but also incredible speed and counterattacking ability facing her head- on was clearly not a wise choice after a few exchanges yiu was strongly kicked in the chest by white tiger flying straight into a nearby demon Crystal while Yu was still struggling to get up white tiger turned back to look at hexim my sheep her gaze was now filled with Hunger like a beast of prey eyeing delicious food y Wu quickly warned not good she's targeting XA my sheep hexi my sheep panicked and backed away you don't come over here white tiger said nothing let out a Roar and lunged straight at Tei my sheep claws raised high as if she wanted to finish her off immediately Ed time my sheep was in danger Yi Wu quickly launched four pillars to block all directions around the white tiger these pillars were immediately connected by Thunder chains locking the white tiger inside this technique is called four-direction Thunder lock luckily I thought of a timely idea now let's see how my beast king account displays its power yiu activated his beast king account concentrating all his taming abilities to deal with this white tiger however the white tiger was truly not ordinary in an instant it shattered the four Direction Thunder loock roaring and charging straight at yiu with immense speed die the white tiger swung its claws aiming directly at ywu but instead of hitting y wo what it destroyed was a gas bomb that ye woo had left behind did you think I would let you kill me so easily the gas bomb exploded releasing a special substance The Taming gas directly into the white Tiger's nostrils immediately it lost the ability to resist rolling on the ground in a paralyzed State ymu watched this scene unable to hide his Delight I didn't expect my beast king account to be so effective for monsters that are primarily Beast forms like the white tiger Clan it's truly powerful in the blink of an eye I have subdued her Yu approached the white tiger seeing it lying motionless and suddenly had a bold idea I think I just had an interesting idea a few minutes later when the white tiger woke up Yu had climbed onto its back trying to ride it like a mount he smiled with satisfaction not bad not bad the view from here is indeed excellent though I have ridden a dragon before having a white tiger as an additional Mount is not bad at all the white tiger wanted to resist but under the pressure from The Taming gas and the power of the beast king account it could do nothing but reluctantly accept its new master ye W turned to look at tasai my sheep and said the white tiger patriarch isn't as difficult to deal with as one might imagine right at this moment hexi my sheep's mind had yet to grasp what was is happening what is going on Vice clan leader white tiger who is usually seen as someone of high Authority whom mil one dares to insult is now being written by yiwu as yiu climbed on white tiger immediately began thrashing wildly seemingly unwilling to cooperate white tiger is quite stubborn instantly Yu pulled out the Beast King's collar to restrain it and commanded let's go put in a little more effort white tiger just stood still waiting for Yu signal before it began to move heai my sheep stood by still in disbelief Vice clan leader white tiger now devoy of any resistance was being ridden by Yu Hess my sheet could hardly believe her eyes watching the scene unfold and exclaimed oh my this is truly horrifying I have to see this again but life is not always a dream just a moment later white tiger unexpectedly charged straight towards the cliff yiu shouted there's no Way Forward what is it trying to do y Wu hurriedly jumped off white Tiger's back letting it continue rushing toward the cliff not only that but white tiger also began to repeatedly bash its head against the rocky wall leaving Yu bewildered it doesn't seem like it's resisting could it have lost its mind out of anger white tiger had just stopped when SII sheep rushed over panting and asking y wo what is the current situation before y wo could respond white tiger unexpected edly turned around and attacked both of them what you managed to break my beast king control so quickly realizing the dangerous situation Yu immediately scooped XE my sheep up and flew away narrowly avoiding the attack when he looked back yo was astonished to discover a strange phenomenon is that space cutting this white tiger still hides such a powerful move yet didn't use it just now immediately after white Tiger's body began to change she Broke Free from her Beast form slowly returning to a human-like shape her Cold Yet authoritative voice echoed hemp if I could have completely controlled my power earlier you have died a thousand times 10,000 times already now fully revealed white tiger was a tigress level 380 she slightly curled her lips her icy gaze fixed on yiu and then slowly said years ago to break through the barrier of power I did not hesitate to commit a taboo coming here to absorb strength from the Blood Demon Crystal but I never expected that its powerful force would backfire causing me to lose Consciousness and fall into a state of Slumber for so many years the Beast form just now was merely my body being controlled by Instinct not by my own will at all but today thanks to you I have awakened if it weren't for your Reckless actions here I might not have been able to awaken this early hearing this Yi Wu merely smiled faintly his gaze Resolute and his voice cold thank you for your very enthusiastic explanation but none of that is related to me regardless of whether you are in Beast form or human form I only offer you two choices either submission or death with that y Wu shot two arrows at Tigress but they were all blocked by a strange Invisible Shield ridiculous do you think this trick is still useful against me well try again y Wu immediately switched to sword form and stabbed hard at the shield but not only did the stab not penetrate but it also knocked him back he staggered back in shock his eyes filled with doubt what Tess mocked surprised huh if you can't return to your Victorious stance You're simply not worthy of my attention clown get lost with that white tiger slashed at Yu with its sharp claws causing him to be thrown far away crashing hard against the cliff yiu murmured his face showing a hint of helplessness this invisible bear not only nullifies my attacks but also counterattacks with such Force what on Earth is this bizarre rule tool damn it clearly I know too little about this field before he could think further tigress's attack came again yiu quickly dodged to the side at that moment hexim my sheep unexpectedly launched a surprise attack from behind Tigress she called out y woo let me help you in a flash hexim my sheep struck hard into white Tiger's back the invisible Shield immediately shattered but what stunned both of them was that white tiger only lost a mere 2% of its Health yimu gritted his teeth impossible but before he could act white tiger turned around and grabbed XI my sheep by the throat she struggled but the overwhelming strength of her opponent made her choke unable to utter a word exi my sheep recognized the girl standing in front of her you were that girl under the goat demon how dare you assist humans wanting to betray our monster Clan betrayers only have one outcome and that is death at that moment xim my sheet was nearly suffocating a powerful attack struck Tigress directly in the face sending her crashing into the mountain side and saving exim my sheep Yu asked are you all right hexi my sheep gasping for breath replied kough cough I was almost dead for sure thankfully you've acted in time yiu smiled and responded I noticed your attack could penetrate her defenses so I immediately understood her defense principle hearing this the other person happily replied finally I was able to help you wait a moment why does this voice not sound like y woo it's a bit feminine hexi my sheep was a bit surprised to hear this what do you mean your voice sounds like a woman's yes let me introduce to all the fans this is the female version of yiwu that we have always been looking forward to aside from having an unusually large bust everything else seems not to have changed much oh and there's one more thing but let's skip that at this moment H my sheep was completely shocked to see y wo in female form she could not believe her eyes hey hey Yu why did you turn into a woman Yu smiled and said I finally understand why the goat demon gave me this tool that crappy old man must have anticipated everything xim my sheet Cried Out eyes WI as she looked at the scene before her what the hell is happening here Yu stood there wearing a knowing smile I know you are surprised but now is not the time to talk it is time to end this battle Yu at that moment was focused on confronting Tigress quickly tilting her head to dodge a powerful claw strike reflecting on it hexi my sheep couldn't help but feel puzzled SOI wo can also transform into a feminine Form This truly exceeds my imagination Tigress laughed disdainfully I never expected a little human like you to have a talent similar to mine as a human your life must be very difficult since we are destined to meet why not become my dog as soon as she finished her words before she could Revel in her Triumph Yu delivered a punch strong enough to send her flying Tigress growled Her Eyes Cold as Ice how can this be a human can overpower me with pure strength like this what strange ability you possess y Wu merely curled her lips coldly replying just an ordinary punch nothing strange about it Furious Tigress began to take things more seriously she immediately Unleashed her ultimate move launching a wide range attack she couldn't help but exclaim even though you clearly transformed into a female your personality is still just like those filthy males all talk and no substance the previous strike had pushed gu wo into a dangerous state but ye W knew clearly that this battle was still not over the debuff technique shock quickly instills fear into the hearts of enemies creating a state of chaos and foolishness lasting for 30 seconds however ye will remain calm Tigress said do not fear death if you must die then just die the important thing is to stand tall and calmly tell me how you wish to die in the dark cave facing tigras yeu did not show any signs of fear he calmly said said attacking AE here aren't you afraid of destroying the core of your monster Clan the debuff state that Tigress unleash was quickly dispelled by Yu which surprised her greatly she widened her eyes and asked why are you still conscious you should have been affected by my debuff yiu did not respond but immediately turned to run out of the cave in tigress's heart she thought go ahead and run I understand now to resist my skill she has exhausted all her energy after all she is just pretending to be strong seeing y wo flee tigess angrily yelled stop don't even think about escaping she shouted As She chased after him her voice full of Rage how far can you run you must be out of strength by now right human your petty tricks have long been seen through by me finishing her words Tigress poured all her strength into a powerful move Pace Beast nonetheless she also revealed her fatigue Breathing heavily she gritted her teeth and said in resisting my attack you have exhausted all your energy but in reality I don't have much strength left to continue either yigu smiled faintly recognizing the pretense in every word of hers he continued to run waiting for the moment to Counterattack Tigress gritted her teeth in challenge if you were to face any other opponent perhaps you would have a chance to escape but unfortunately you are facing me I never underestimate any enemy now you me an I will use all my strength to crush you as soon as she finished speaking Tigress immediately used the technique sigh of Soul unleashing a powerful attack towards yiu causing the space around them to tremble violently however despite the strength of the technique yiu only lost 50% of her health she still stood firm leaving Tigress completely stunned how how is this possible you can actually withstand my attack with your body even the other great Elders cannot do that Yu felt a surge of Rage shouting damn honestly you have really pissed me off always nagging endlessly Yi Wu lunged forward grabbed her head and lifted her High into the sky have you admitted your mistake yet before she could finish her scolding Yu slammed her head down into the ground I was wrong damn it I was wrong Yu coldly replied still daring to argue it seems that only punishment will do theed immediately after she began delivering strong punches to tigress's abdomen causing her to scream in pain ah I was wrong I was wrong stop it I know I was wrong Yu continued to punch hard not giving her a chance to breathe then why are you still yelling like that if you've been wrong then you should be punished even more Tigress screamed in agony ah who who are you what difference does it make whether I admit my mistake or not Yu said while continuously slamming The Tigress down onto the ground ah perhaps this old lady's mentality will be relatively refreshed The Tigress in pain thought to herself I have never been beaten like this my whole body from top to bottom is in agony because of her well why do I suddenly feel a strange warmth in my heart until now I have always held power and maintained a high position among the great Elders monsters always showed me respect when they met me in my eyes even my male form everyone else was not worth mentioning but she is completely different from all the monsters of the white tiger Clan even my male form cannot compare with her she's truly powerful an unprecedented feeling of pleasure surged in my heart yuu looked at the expression of the tigress and thought to herself what is this unusual look in her eyes where did her previous anger go wait a minute could it be that I've beaten her into a state of heat what exactly is wrong with this Tigress ye woo and exi my sheep standing outside couldn't help but sigh I've been shocked for a whole year it seems your protagonist has done something truly horrifying yuu replied I also didn't expect that my female version would possess a hidden ability that even I do not have Tigress clung to ye wound's leg saying I was wrong no I am not wrong but now I admit I am wrong yet I also do not admit I am wrong hit me hit me twice so that I can feel double Love Don't Be slow hurry up and take action I always hope to meet a powerful figure like you please continue to let me indulge in the baptism of powerful strength these words make y Wu extremely uncomfortable get lost don't touch me so annoying either kill me already as she spoke she raised her fist Yi wunam immediately stopped her wait don't kill her I have a better plan if we kill tigress and her power returns to her body it will be be very Troublesome suddenly Yi Wun looked at Yi wam with an extremely serious expression ha as a man are you so indecisive we should kill all these monsters you're being too rational it's better for me to take over the main Consciousness yay wunam thought to himself this time it's serious if Yi wuen insists on taking over the Consciousness what will happen to my herum then when Yi wuin beat Tigress into submission she continued to provoke why are you not taking action feel free to use violence against me it's okay I can take it Yu was extremely annoyed enough you dance with me like a steel pipe as a monster boss you should have a bit of the aura of a boss what are you doing the more she spoke the more provocative she became boss from now on you are my boss I will obey you in everything Yi Wu angrily replied but don't forget you were the one who told me not to kill her before now hurry up and use the beast king account to deal with her or I can't be sure how much longer I can hold back yide in exasperation with herself the system announced the void beast king live fan account has been activated for the host the target's affection level has reached the level of infatuation with a success rate of 15% for taming does the host wish to proceed with taming now before she could answer Tigress suddenly said Master finally you are ready to take action against me the system announced the target has automatically reversed roles voluntarily submitting there is no need for the host to use the taming skill Tigress has been successfully tamed yiu was astonished to discover that not only had Tigress submitted voluntarily but it was also Beyond her expectations the position of white tiger great Elder had now become a battle pet of the boss level she murmured I didn't expect everything to go so smoothly notification system due to its extremely high level of domestication tigeress has completely opened its heart to the host and connected with its memories at soon as the system finished speaking a strange space appeared before the two in the memories the white tiger as a child looked truly adorable it innocently picked flowers and chased butterflies showing no signs of being a powerful monster in the future the Monster World of the early era was indeed very primitive and peaceful however everything suddenly changed while while chasing a butterfly the young white tiger curiously approached a large gate The Blood Demon crystal in front of it appeared a strange button with its innocent curiosity it touched it with its paw immediately the sky changed a terrifying anomaly appeared and from within the Blood Demon Crystal a monstrous creature emerged how long has it been since the Great War With The Golden Dragon how long have we been in deep Slumber I finally waited for the day to awaken once more the young white tiger was frightened and turned to flee but no matter how hard it tried it was still captured by the monster the creature looked at it and a deep voice resonated little creature do not rush to leave don't you a weak being long for strength join me no matter how small you are with my help from a higher Dimension your blood will surge your bones will strengthen and your body will become a powerful weapon as it spoke the monster transmitted an incredibly powerful force forse to the small white tiger making it larger more ferocious and stronger not stopping there it also split the white tiger into two parts with one part being kept and the other Vanishing the monster laughed loudly your ancestors have died no one can control this world anymore The Souls of all monsters will finally become the nourishment for me to restore my strength Nature's peace will go to hell monsters should indulge in killing and freely create chaos this is my reward for you for awakening me once again ye W sense the aura of the monster and immediately guessed that the aura of the black shadow was that of an ancient god so the Monster World also has an ancient god the truth is gradually becoming clear back to the present Yi wuu also reached the time to return to her true form showing great disappointment how boring I've only been out to play for a short while and the time is already up that person is too rational it's really not not interesting this time I didn't enjoy it to the fullest next time the Consciousness should be in my hands she said and then completely vanished the female version of myself is extremely ambitious seemingly a bit uncontrollable it seems that unless absolutely necessary it's better to use this move sparingly in the future y wo must also be afraid of the female version of herself therefore there is a saying the heart of a woman is truly frightening you W thought combining with the intelligence news that goat demon provided earlier I have basically pieced together the truth behind this Monster World the initiator of everything is the ancient deity who once appeared in the memory of the White Tiger 13 ancient deities spread across various dimensions and spaces influencing many different worlds they are the greatest known enemies at present the ancient deity in the memory of the white tiger seems to have not yet achieved its goals it is highly likely that this being is still lurking in the Monster World I must find a way to uncover it after this campaign y Wu gained the new wonderling when returning to the white Tiger's Hall in an instant the male tiger recalled many memories from the past when I and she once had a connection of Consciousness could it be that something happened on her side just then a subordinate reported great king Vice clan leader she has returned but Vice clan leader she has become a mount for humans now the words hit like like a thunderbolt and the white tiger was extremely shocked it roared what did you say seeing y Wu riding on the back of its Vice clan leader the white tiger subordinates immediately Advance fiercely human what have you done to the vice clan leader this is an unforgivable insult all the subordinates were Furious get down from Vice clan leader the kuuan Wu Clan is just the weakest among our four great Clans do you think defeating them means you can defeat us daring to come alone to our stronghold you truly do not know the expanse of Heaven and Earth yiu coldly replied you say I came here alone have you considered the feelings of the mount beneath me either submit or annihilate your tribe choose one as soon as the words were spoken the white tiger beside her L out a fierce Roar an overwhelming pressure enveloping all of the subordinates one of the subordinates trembled and spoke up great king why is the vice clan leader threatening us is it possible that she willingly submits to this human hearing this the white tiger furiously roared damn it you are a bunch of useless fools surrounded a human and yet you don't dare to make a move being from the white tiger Clan do you want to let the enemy intimidate you like a tier do you wish to turn our clan into a laughing stock in the Monster World the subordinates hastily explained no it's not like that great king we are not afraid of this human it's just just that the vice clan leader the white tiger shifted into a combat stance roaring with authority are you telling me that all of this is vice clan leader fault all the subordinates bowed their heads none dared to retort immediately the white tiger let out a thunderous Roar throwing all of its subordinates in every direction Yu also had to jump to the side to avoid it male tiger Furious shouted get away from me I will cut open this human and see just how weighty he really is yiu thought to himself this Tiger's personality is truly domineering it seems that dealing with it is not going to be easy after thinking that Yu charge forward delivering a straight punch to the white Tiger's head however the white tiger nimbly dodged the attack the white tiger said its voice filled with Menace human you are indeed not simple no wonder you have been able to continuously overthrow many of our kin like this but this time you have encountered me immediately afterward the white tiger activated its ultimate skill white tiger golden body this skill allows it to be immune to damage and prevents any skills from marking it however while using this the white tiger cannot perform any additional actions the white tiger sneered you are not weak but you truly underestimate me not only do you treat Tigress as a mount but upon meeting you wish for us to submit or die you replied you blame me for not not speaking reason for being too ruthless but your monsters have always revered strength disregarding methods only acknowledging the powerful right the white tiger smirked its gaze sharp in principle that is true but in front of me you do not have the qualification to say such words as soon as the words left its mouth the white tiger Unleashed its strongest move the body of a demonic Soldier immediately shot a whirlwind towards ywo then used the body of a demonic soier to slash at the Whirlwind no matter what dark methods you use to tame Tigress it will have no effect on me he said this while jumping high using the body of a demonic Soldier to create an enormous sword that plunged down as long as I kill you tigas will naturally recover the sword descended with Incredible speed creating an earth shattering explosion stomach Fein said our great king is the body of a demonic Soldier your body is the most powerful weapon in the entire Monster World The Majestic might of the great king from years past has not diminished this human is truly unfortunate to dare to face a powerful combo move from the great king headon he is dead for sure and definitely won't even have bones left haha a loud laugh echoed but soon after a shout rang out run away we will be affected by the aftermath of the battle if we don't run fast we will meet the same fate as that human the subordinates were terrified ah damn it you all look over there in the battlefield there seems to be a figure it's that human he is completely unharmed not even a hair is injured what kind of monster is this human oh I feel it chilled down my spine ye W thought to kill Guan wo and Achieve absolute defense is indeed a highly effective strategy plucking the wool from the sheep of the Monstrous beasts then using that very wool to deal with them is a remarkably sustainable and successful tactic the white tiger never underestimates his enemies even when dealing with an ant he always uses his full strength but when he saw y Wu unharmed he was extremely astonished what how can this person heu continued white tiger patriarch we're playing a game gear but don't take death lightly to avoid causing a tragedy why didn't you listen to me earlier among the four Great Clans only your white tiger Clan hasn't invaded the human world so I can spare your lives but under one condition the white tiger immediately asked what condition Yu replied it's very simple as I stated from the beginning submit to me when necessary join forces with me to resist Azure dragon and suzaku Yu then broke into a bright smile and continued of course you may choose to refuse but the consequence of refusal will be just as I have said extermination of your clan the white tiger thought to himself what is this using the most harmless appearance to utter the harshest words this is not a human clearly he is a monster the plees chicken level 100 said haha even the great king cannot do anything against him we are definitely no match in fact we have no other choice hearing that monkey monkey a being at the level of 320 immediately mocked stop with the threats looking at your weak appearance I'm scared to the point that it sounds like a chicken crowing he mimicked The Voice caku caku are you crowing here then he sarcastically said humans like you think you could deceive all of us this great one has seen through it long ago the only reason you can withstand the attacks of the great king without any harm is merely by borrowing the Kuan artifact from your human world as a monkey I am the ancestor of your kind you dare to play tricks in front of your ancestor this is a great Act of rebellion great king I believe that not only should we not submit to him but we should also AE with Azure dragon and suzaku great Elder to kill him before he could finish his words he was immediately slapped by white tiger shattering his mouth are you teaching me how to do things damn it I'm still here and you already want to self-proclaim as the great king you foolish monkey white tiger shouted I personally engaged in battle with this human to clearly understand his true strength he managed to single-handedly kill Juan Wu and tame tigess how could he merely rely on such a a simple artifact although I may sound tough deep down I am fully aware the true strength of the human before us is indeed unfathomable for the clan and for the humiliation of tigeress I must endure after a moment of thought white tiger said to YW I can agree to your condition and work together with you to deal with suzaku and Azure Dragon after all I have never gotten along with them however I also have one condition no matter what method you use to control Tigress you must restore her freedom and Consciousness if you plan to merge your powers with her to confront me that would not sit well even though I do not care too much is still better to avoid unnecessary complications yeu listen to this and frowned slightly asking back if that's all it will be very difficult for me to trust you you need to give me a reason to believe in you at this moment white tiger blushed hesitated and said because because I I love Tigress I TR TR love her very much I do not want to see her being controlled by someone else nor can I merge with her again because if that happens I will never be able to see her again Yu looked at white tiger for a moment still not fully convinced but at least now the other part is reason was much clearer hearing white tigers say that yiu immediately showed sympathy and tried to comfort him so that's how it is I understand although you are bisexual individuals separated from one entity this kind of of Brotherly Love I can somewhat relate to after all I do have a very lovely younger sister the system noticed that the situation was starting to go too far and couldn't take it anymore so it appeared it spoke up to remind Master to avoid any further misunderstandings I think I need to clarify the light from the system Spectrum appeared in a blush pink indicating embarrassment it continued white Tiger's love is not a simple brotherly affection but rather bisexual love Yu was taken aback upon hearing that he stammered what loving his own male self what the hell is that white tiger paid no attention to Yu's reaction and continued to recount his story since I can remember I have always been by tigress's side we play together search for food together practice together gradually I naturally developed feelings for Tigress but when I finally mustered the courage to express my feelings she revealed a shocking truth to me like a bolt from the blue white tiger continued his tone dropping it happened at a cliff one day that day I looked at tigress and said Tigress actually I have always liked you I just have never dared to confess white tiger Story made the atmosphere even more tense Tigress said love me are you joking we were initially one entity you were merely a part of me separated into a different gender this statement from tiges chocked the male tiger why why is it like this Tigress why are you telling me these things Tigress continued love is not important to us what matters most is that we must train to become stronger and then seek out and take revenge on the monster I Unleashed but even though I am a single entity with two genders my love remains unchanged the male tiger looked at tigress and slowly said Tigress if this is the most important thing to you then I will help you no matter what want to do I will support you the male tiger sadly said even though deep down the male tiger wants to tell tigras that loving her is the most important thing he cannot utter those words Tigress is solely focused on becoming stronger to take revenge she does not care about my love or encroaching upon the human world even though that is what I have tried to convey I have tried many times to bring her back to the right path but in the end I still have to give up because of that demand even our thoughts are opposing I must still support her Yu looked at White Tiger's attitude and thought to himself I didn't expect to encounter such a surprising opportunity loving oneself is truly something strange however judging by white Tiger's demeanor it seems he is not lying the world of monsters is not only about killing and bloodshed white tiger continued therefore I agree to your terms but you must release Tigress if you do not agree I will have to confront you to the end although I know I may ultimately fail for her I will not give up as soon as white tiger finished speaking monkey monkey interjected from the side white tiger you really disappoint me you never attack the human world I once thought you were just weak but now I really did not expect you to have degenerated to the point of being willing to lower yourself and associate with a human you are not weak you are completely useless immediately white tiger charged forward intending to teach monkey monkey a lesson what does a monkey who does not know life and death have to do with teaching me monkey monkey also took out a tool defend off white tiger I have long wanted to betray a useless fellow like you I just haven't had the opportunity now that the chance has come killing you will allow me to sit in the position of patriarch of white tiger as soon as the statue was activated the male tiger completely lost the ability to fight Dan this oppressive feeling is uncomfortable yet very familiar ye W immediately recognize the aura of the ancient god he thought to himself the statue in the hands of this monkey is related to the ancient god the monkey cackled triumphantly haha a sick cat wants to show off in front of me I won't hesitate to tell you I have long endured your ways therefore I have secretly shifted my support to the aure dragon great Elder this statue was entrusted to me by the mighty havenly beast of the Azure Dragon great Elder it will help me restrain you at a crucial moment both y Wu and the white tiger were affected their souls trembled yiwu could clearly Feel the fear invading him having tamed Tigress as a mount and shared Consciousness with her I am also affected by this statue the monkey turned to speak to his remaining subordinance haha I did not expect that just one Statue could scare you all so much what a bunch of useless fools you all see that weaklings like the white tiger don't deserve to lead us let me be the patriarch of the white tiger Clan then we'll join forces with the aure dragon great Elder to conquer the human world we will Slaughter drink their blood and eat their flesh freely everyone United in agreement haha that's right we've wanted to do this for a long time in the past we had to hold back in the face of the white Tiger's threat too afraid to challenge it but now things are different if the dam it Monster isn't eating people what else should we call it we've been suppressed for so long and finally we can invade the human world and spread chaos our clan the Yan W wo can finally live freely the level 100 pleads chicken trembled in fear but spoke up to defend the white tiger please please don't do this everyone think carefully the Patriarchs white tiger has always treated us well how can we be so ungrateful although I am always terrified I also understand the importance of judging right from wrong if we carry out what the monkey monkey is thinking our white tiger Clan will be annihilated as soon as he finished speaking he was ganged up on by the other Lords an idiot can lose it it doesn't matter this life isn't worth living anyway if you want to go with him we'll let you go with him pl's chicken tried to resist white tiger please run away with the vice clan leader these bastards have lost their minds I will sacrifice myself to stop them Ki muang just defeated the ple chicken and said with a trash rank like you you're not even enough to be an elite monster you still W to stop us making you a lord only shows that the white tiger really lacks ability monkey monkey laughed loudly since ancient times High positions have belonged to the powerful looking at your current appearance you look like a small ball that can be easily destroyed by others haha but don't worry our clan will never disappear I am more suited for the patriarch position than you in the future the white tiger Clan will be called the Great eight Clan aha the white tiger felt bitter in his heart damn it this monkey dared to insult me like this but I am truly being suppressed by the aura of this statue unable to move monkey monkey continued to provoke fight back quickly get up and fight back wasn't it very easy to beat me before why will you dare to fight now if you don't fight back I will chop off your head and use it as a urinal haaha while speaking monkey monkey swung his sword down at the white tiger's head but in an instant something sliced across s covering both arms he exclaimed what the hell is this what's going on ah it turns out to be Yu from the beast king account the White Tiger has chosen to surrender to me it is now my subordinate you are not allowed to touch it he really acted because of the white tiger monkey monkey screened damn it my arm ah why is everyone just standing there hurry up and kill this damn human for me if you humans had chosen to sit idly by and watch the show you wouldn't have to die so soon this is all your own doing we are not fools like the kuuan Wu tribe who will give you the chance to attack one by one no matter how capable you are you cannot deal with so many lords like us at once y Wu calmly replied who gave you that confidence with just a swing of his sword Yu sent them flying in all directions not stopping there he immediately used the skill of the beast king taming Ward to control them I am not targeting anyone in particular I simply think you all present here are one energy pack everyone was confused what is happening I can't move it all the system announced that the monster Lords had lost the ability to move and were currently being forced to absorb monster Chi power a feeling of having their bodies drained invaded them as the monster Chi power continued to be absorbed just like that all of their strength was sued into Yu's account the Golden Dragon physique the Golden Dragon physique was fully charged at 100% the special account of the golden Dragon physique could now be used normally after using the Golden Dragon physique account the yellow dragon Tyrant body skill was activated and the monster Elder Unleashed inora for the monster Clan with absolute bloodline suppression yiu thought to himself the passive skill after completing energy recharge is so powerful this account will definitely be an absolute weapon for me to become the monster gate all the monsters in the white tiger Clan territory knelt down before the imposing presence of the Golden Dragon the powerful Aura was frightening yet not evil like the aura that statue IM minute earlier it instead made me want to submit to him from the depths of my heart what on Earth is happening why does this human exude such a dominant Aura yet makes me feel incredibly warm submission I currently just want to submit to him although I don't know why when I sense this Aura in an instant I felt that as long as he is here I will be deeply at peace not stopping at the white tiger Clan Yu Unleashed an even stronger Aura penetrating the Blue Sky enveloping the entire Monster World the white tiger was bewildered what does he want to do could it be that he wants to spread this Aura throughout the entire world the goat demon jolted in Surprise upon discovering a powerful Aura emerging this Aura could it be the legendary Golden Aura recorded in the ancient texts of monster could it be that our Elder wants to manifest once again it seems the world of monster is truly about to undergo a transformation in the territory of suzaku the great Elder of suzaku also sensed the anomaly the white tiger Clan emanated an astonishing Aura causing him to wonder who could possibly release such vast and dense divon energy below the great Elder suzaku's subordinates were standing by awaiting orders the Swift fire serpent Level 240 the willow deer level 270 Jang yulu level 250 and the earthworm level 230 silently observed the situation the suzaku great Elder level 390 smiled faintly his voice tinged with excitement after being bored for so long finally something interesting is happening in the territory of azure Dragon this strange Aura did not escape the notice of the Azure Dragon great Elder level 400 he pondered deeply his sharp gaze focused this human really knows have a stir up trouble no matter how he stirs things up he is still just a human even if spared he cannot cause any significant turmoil however one thing that made the Azure Dragon great Elder feel uneasy was the presence behind that aura he frowned murmuring ancient god wasn't he supposed to have fallen in that battle long ago why is his Aura appearing again suddenly in Azure dragon's mind a voice rang out monsters heed my command I claiming the title of Golden Dragon physique order you to gather at Blood Demon Crystal this is the voice of that human ywu said there is no need to panic the reason you all can hear my voice simultaneously is that this is the power of the golden dragon physique the ancestor of your Beast Clan I am connecting to your Consciousness through its Divine sense someone spoke up suzaku great Elder should we go suzaku replied why shouldn't we go at the gig of the monster Clan all the monster Clans had gathered efficiently by now the star horse level 270 said since when did this fox join our conservative faction your Azure Dragon Clan is not the most warlike Jane muuk kwam level 300 laughed hi hi hi have you heard females are always fickle this fox knows how to choose decide I think after seeing the strength of that human named y Wu you want to keep her life right the white tiger spoke why woo this human is not simple at all looking at this situation with just one command from him he can assemble 90% of the monsters Tigress said of course not simple you have no idea how many are infatuated with his female body tigress's words left the male tiger extremely confused it seemed he couldn't quite understand Tigress how far have we actually developed could it be that we have ever had such deep communication the goat demon approached looking up at ye wooed and said vwoo it has only been a short time since we last met yet you have undergone such Earth shattering changes creation truly is a grand Creator I indeed do not misjudge you however what I am even more curious about is why you have gathered us all here you replied just wait until all the monsters arrive and you will find out the goat demon continued all the monsters Gathering here I'm afraid that won't be possible at least suzaku great Elder and Azure Dragon great Elder will not come before he could finish his sentence the presence of suzaku appeared in the sky look there is the strongest among the four Great Elders the Pinnacle of monsters in our clan suzaku great Elder I never expected even she would personally come here truly astonishing suzaku great Elder rarely comes out today I am lucky to behold her Visage oh my love is now fulfilled suzaku sat high above showing a look of disappointment I came here just to see what humans are like that dare to claim to be the ancestors of the monster but now I feel let down a child not even enough hair has grown truly a waste for me to come all this way myself ywu thought to them the posture of an overbearing person is something no one can imitate although somewhat arrogant it fits her status as a member of the monster Clan a character that is very difficult to deal with suddenly dark clouds gathered in the sky and thunder rumbled the Heavenly Beast of level 375 appeared indeed disappointing little brat you lack the overbearing and arrogant presence that a powerful being should possess I was ordered by the Azure Dragon great Elder to come here temporarily to see what your true purpose is in gathering us here yiu responded you are the Heavenly Beast right I have long heard about you from the mouth of the monster invading the world of humans he replied little kid don't waste everyone's time you should understand that the time of the week is not plentiful Yi Wu smiled coldly no I think you are mistaken it is not I who want to talk to you but rather your sect Elder as soon as he finished speaking Yi Wu immediately activated his dragon body immediately the entire group of monsters was weighed down by this pressure the powerful Aura causing their souls to tremble damn it we can't even kneel we can only lie face down on the ground a sigh echoed Elder quickly retract your divine power we are about to be buried alive the Heavenly Beast thought this pressure not only affects me even the suzaku great Elder beside me cannot cope with it calmly indeed as the edger Dragon great Elder has said this human cannot be underestimated at this moment the Golden Dragon physique merged with Y woo expressing disappointment recalling the past I was once the ruler of a region contending with high level beings unexpectedly The Descendants are as weak and foolish as this I was killed fighting against the ancient god using my body to create this world with the purpose for you to reproduce evolve powerfully and seek revenge on the ancient god yet you have been manipulated by the ancient god suddenly controlling the evolution and unity of the monster Clan if this continues the monster Clan will only Doom itself you unfilial ones listen carefully if you wish to embrace the future and swallow Humanity that is not the answer answer what needs to be done is to eliminate the ancient god who is secretly controlling the monster Clan hearing Golden Dragon physique say this all the monsters were extremely confused and skeptical which ancient God we have never heard of this are we being secretly manipulated by it another monster spoke up feeling that this was hard to believe are you joking the group of monsters still did not believe in the story about the Elder and the ancient god Elder If there really is an elder why have we never heard of it even if it is the elder of our monster Clan what does it have to do with a human why does it keep wanting to borrow the human's body to teach us Heavenly Beast thought to himself the flame of doubt in the hearts of the monsters is growing larger everyone should not fall into this kid's trap lest he continue to impersonate gods and demons they should work together to eliminate him Heavenly Beast thought about the plan that patriarch azur Dragon had entrusted to him instigate the suzaku clan and the human named ywu to engage in a life and death duel while also adding another flame to this conflict goat demon then spoke up to confirm wait reporting to the Supreme King although the suzaku gy Elder has not been verified I have indeed seen the Legends related to the Elder in the ancient text of our monster Clan as for thean wo Clan they have completely pledged their loyalty to Yi wo already the Supreme King no matter how you decide our Chuan Wu Clan will follow you unconditionally your sword is our guiding star havenly Beast continues to provoke it's clear that the factions are distinctly divided the suan Wu Clan Has betrayed our monster kin suzaku great Elder if you are present here I think you should step up to help our monster Clan Rectify this matter havenly Beast continues as your dragon Clan you hide away afraid to show yourselves now here you are borrowing the name of suzaku great Elder to let the fox exploit the Tiger's might if you want to fight then let's fight we are not afraid at this moment Tigress finally speaks up actually I can prove everything ye who said is true for I have witnessed the ancient god with my own eyes according to his words I was the one who personally released that ancient God causing me to be split into two forms two genders and it is precisely me white tiger continues white tiger Vice clan leader you are only telling one side of the story can you provide other more convincing evidence I have heard that your white tiger Clan just like thean wo Clan has submitted to that human named Yi Wu what you say now truly lacks persuasiveness hearing this white tiger became Furious shouting damn it what Tigress says is exactly what it is havenly Beast you are merely a lord who among you dares to question the patriarch white tiger great Elder do not waste time speaking nonsense with havenly beasts any longer the azur Dragon great Elder is hiding and doesn't dare to show up we could just kill it directly y woo having heard enough arguing let out a roar that silenced all the monsters earlier as I said have you all thought enough this is not a negotiation but command if anyone refuses to cooperate I will eliminate that person first at this moment suzaku spoke up it's not that I don't trust you but if you want to command the monsters you need to have corresponding strength are you Worthy as soon as she finished speaking suzaku unleashed the move summoning heaven to recall the past summoning an apparition that charged straight at yiu the goat demon below panicked suzaku great Elder is taking the initiative to attack the Flames she unleashes can melt everything however behind that fire yiu remained unscathed immediately suzaku used the windwing shell technique instantly moving to yiu side the goat demon on the side analyzed she can utilize the flame marvelously to Traverse Heaven and Earth closing in on her enemy immediately in battle and delivering a lethal blow after closing the distance to Yu suzaku unleashed the fire of karma spreads all over the Prairie generating a terrifying heat that incinerated him the Raging Inferno seemed poised to completely melt Yu away yet Yu stood there unharmed he slowly emerged from the sea of flames casting a cold glance at suzaku is that all is this the power of the patriarch monster you wish to use to challenge me the entire Arena was engulfed in astonishment suzuku gritted her teeth her eyes filled with determination but now fear began to creep into her heart contrary to the goat Demon's worries y Wu activated the true power of the dragon body a surge of powerful energy erupted sending suzaku flying far away this immense force of demonic energy came from the special account of the dragon body when activated it would continuously deplete energy and if the energy ran out it would need to be fully recharged to be used again y wo sternly warned please cherish the dragon body form now it's my turn seeing y Wu truly taking action kianu laughed excitedly finally we are moving wait until you all fight until the death our Dragon Clan will be the unexpected beneficiary unifying the Monster World at that time no one can stop us from destroying the human world suzaku looked at Yu and coldly laughed haha this Aura comes from deep within the soul that guy is not joking at all after saying that suzaku transformed into its original form and soared into the sky y Wu immediately pursued loudly declaring you want to change the battlefield no problem I am ready to serve to the end after reaching a certain height suzaku used the flame burning Heaven technique to attack seeing Yu still resol Ely chasing after suzuku coldly remarked human I admire your courage the remaining energy is 85% but the sky is my domain even King long cannot defeat me in aerial combat I will illuminate the entire sky and be ready to step into the world of flames the remaining energy is 78% turn to ashes that is your fate completely buried in suffering suzaku again directed his Flames towards yiu to incinerate him how however that flame was fully absorbed by Yu forming a gigantic Fireball the remaining energy is 64% Your Flames are not bad this toy is quite interesting here I'll return it to you as he spoke Yu hurled the fireball towards suzaku causing suzaku to lose 40% of his health the remaining energy is only 50% the game ends here game over Yu immediately used all 50% of his remaining energy to unleash an emperor Sovereign hund Dragon slash when the energy was completely exhausted suzaku was brought down with his current health only 12% suzaku murmured why why you she said you humans truly know how to conquer however I have lost and a loss is a loss I will not find any excuses for it after getting up suzaku immediately knelt down and said I acknowledge your strength moreover the Elder has chosen you I am willing to lead the suzaku tribe to submit to you y Wu thought to himself monsters are indeed a pure race that worships strength as long as one is strong enough the more powerful the monster the easier it is to be subdued if not running out of energy to continue fighting will turn into a bitter struggle K and Shu witnessing this scene couldn't help but feel confused what the hell is happening in a battlefield of life and death can there really be a handshake for Pete's wait d damn it all the monsters here have surrendered to that kid doesn't that mean I'm all alone in the enemy camp right now he anxiously thought further I must quickly use the communication device to report this situation to King LOM great Elder but what is this the communication device given by King long great Elder is not functioning no it's a barrier there is some kind of barrier blocking the effectiveness of the device damn it I have to retreat immediately I must go back to report to King long great Elder Cheno had not yet retreated when Chang and his sister Annie finally appeared fans had almost forgotten about these two compared to Le Jin Joe whom we had only encountered through the magic Crystal to issue Mission orders we had never met in person now we finally got to meet our Idol Kon Shu Lord don't be in such a hurry to leave let's reminisce a bit before we fight we should talk a little to remember the past and gain some motivation and Chang said you were the one who supplied me with the mutated herbs through gingo all along right K Shu replied that foolish Leu ging even told you about this it's no wonder a human who surrendered so easily without any preparation died so soon and Chang recalled the moment he transformed his body aha why you have to be like this the process of transformation from this type of herb causes excruciating pain I have a better method to help you through this process and Chang countered no no need for that if after transforming into a monster I can't maintain my reasoning then what use is this transforming power I can bear it keep going seeing this Li Jin Jaa was quite impressed with enang monsters like us have always looked down on your kind in our rise you are merely weak and vulnerable creatures but you truly have the qualifications to become one of us after enduring pain for a while and Chang also transformed into a monster Li jingel handed him a Teleport ation device and said this is the teleportation gate that Cen Shu Lord instructed me to give you take it and hide it in a discret place within the safe zone of the human world and Chang curiously asked who is kunan shell Lord Le jinel explained Yan shung Lord is the second in command of the Dragon holding a position close to King LOM great Elder he manages all the Treasures of the clan and has the authority to use any device within it at the same time he is also the most talented Creator and inventor of the monster Clan this teleportation gate was created by Him He emphasized further you must remember one thing the mission to secretly release the teleportation gate must succeed and failure is absolutely not an option Keon shell Lord is a person with a secretive mind a cruel personality and does not tolerate failure if you fail his punishment will be a thousand times more painful than the process of your body transformation just now returning to the present and Chang said lie Jin Joo is a brute who only knows how to se power of course he is not as clever as others who keep their thoughts hidden always lurking in the shadows and manipulating everything but in the end he died early and with less pain Ken Shu you have used the mutated herb to make me endure tremendous suffering I naturally must thank you in a fitting way Li jino died because of his foolishness and you were not much smarter I initially did not want to deal with you but you have intentionally stood in my way actively bringing yourself to my doorstep Sister Sister don't interfere this is my battle only by killing K Shu myself can I thoroughly sever the roots of my past mistakes and Chang said then transformed into the form of King long to take the attack of kananu the arm of King long truly resembled the words of the king long great Elder K Shu scoffed and said you possess a very strange ability moreover you have recaptured his power how ridiculous you always talk about wanting to cut off your past and give up becoming a monster yet you are using the power of that monster and Chang replied firmly so what using your very own monster power to kill you isn't that even more exhilarating for me having said that an Chang immediately unleashed the four Direction wind dragon roar aimed directly at K Shu tianu immediately used the Black Shield dragon scale to block the attack he sneered is stealing the power of others all you can do that only proves that you are incapable of anything after blocking the attack with the black shield dragon scale he instantly transformed turning into sharp arrows that shot straight towards en Chang dragon scale advancing dance the power of King long great Elder is not just this last time he didn't even reveal his true form what you replicated is merely a bit of feather and Chang immediately employed all things submit to the EMB embroidery to counter the arrows in his heart he thought to be able to fight me evenly and to use the power of King long so skillfully he truly deserves to be the second strongest of the king long Clan haha this is really interesting he looked at Kuan Shu his voice full of challenge your abilities are indeed difficult to deal with but can you replicate my abilities to fight me evenly if this continues there will be no meaning to it Ken Shu laughed loudly no meaning human do you think I want to win quickly wrong I want to slowly torture you with the power of the monsters until I am satisfied he narrowed his eyes his voice turning cold haha don't be too confident your abilities are useless to me because I have discovered a critical weakness in your abilities and Chang squinted a sense of unease arising weakness what do you mean Ken sh smir explaining coldly your ability can replicate the power and rank of others right but you cannot replicate artifacts that is your greatest flaw the Trap Dragon Lock is a Divine artifact that can be used both to attack and bind enemies as well as a powerful defensive tool when binding an enemy it creates a paralysis effect rapidly diminishing magic power and sealing all skills he immediately used this Divine artifact shooting straight towards enchain en Chang was bound unable to resist the paralysis effect along with the rapidly decreasing Magic Power Ren rendered him completely helpless even its copying ability could not be utilized he coldly laughed as a member of the Dragon do you think merely relying on the replicated power of the great Elder can deal with me even if you bind me killing you immediately will not be an easy task but do you think I appeared today without thorough preparation he took out a vial and continued this is an evoled herb that I researched myself until now I have not had the opportunity to use it but today I will test its effect after saying this he drank the violin one go in an instant his body transformed into a mighty black dragon he roared yes this is the feeling of overwhelming power humble human tremble and despair at this moment anchang was completely stripped of any means to resist like a fish lying on a cutting board with no path of Escape Tian Shu immediately used Thunder child light launching a fatal blow die you Aunt sister won't as the was about to strike in Chang's head Annie appeared blocking the attack to protect her brother but the power was too great Annie could only withstand one blow before being severely injured and falling to the ground I'm sorry and Chang sister interrupted your battle but still I have to protect you no no let me go let me go and Chang shouted in despair tears streaming down his face Cen Shu laughed coldly humans are truly amusing willing to sacrifice for others because of emotions but this time you won't be so lucky turn to ashes immediately can Sho spat out purple Thunder Earth towards and Chang in a moment of life and death several flashes of Swords appeared cutting through the chains that bound men Chang in the trapped Dragon Lock a voice rang out I'm sorry senior I was delayed over there so I arrived late the Trap Dragon Lock was easily destroyed leaving Kell extremely astonished he roared just a human dares to destroy my Divine artifact Yu said there is no absolute power in this world only Power that can restrain each other therefore senior please restore my power to deal with this evil dragon as for your past you should cut it off by yourself whether the account power system can be restored by senior and chain depends on your will if you agree everything will be resolved if not he cannot force the restoration hearing this kenu sneered restore your power haha even if he fails to restore the power of the patriarch of the king long Clan restoring your abilities would be useless y Wu confidently replied my power may not be the strongest but it is more than enough to deal with you and chain placed his hand on Yu's shoulder his eyes filled with trust vwo I always unconditionally trusted your judgment sister I temporarily ask you to take care of him then he used his ability to restore the power of the Void beast king this energy though not completely similar to King long was still very special and fierce even exceeding in thickness and depth and Chang smiled saying vwu thank you in just a few seconds and Chang successfully restored the power of the Void beast king this time he was ready to face any challenges ahead the pressure from this force made Chan feel a deep sense of fear what is happening kid why did you suddenly unleash this oppressive presence that makes me feel like I'm facing a strong enemy cayen Shu thought to himself trembling could it be that this ability can truly restrain me after thinking for a while he boldly said is this ability of yours really stronger than that of the king long great Elder you changed to a weaker ability to carry out the replication isn't that seeking your own death haha however even so to ensure safety it's better not to clash head on he continued to ponder I hold the power to utilize all the dragon treaches with countless artifacts am I still afraid I won't be able to deal with you having thought this he threw the bone piercing Iron Lotus towards en Chang this was an epic level artifact and as soon as it was launched it shot out 996 sharp iron needles each needle carried a highly potent poison capable of penetrating deep into the bones the iron needles shot out like a torrential rain making it hard for the opponent to evade in the face of this perilous situation and Chang immediately activated Eagle Eye his visual ability developed to an extraordinary level with his pupils adjusting Focus to see every movement clearly he gritted his teeth and said if you dare lay a hand on my sister I swear I will not let you die so easily the acceleration skill enhances explosive movement speed and increases the evasion rate thanks to this skill the iron needle could not touch Chang at all I will torture you until I have vented all my anger after approaching Kean Shu and Chang Unleashed a thunderous blow punching him straight in the face this punch is a return for my sister and Chang shouted judgment reaction speed power all of his attributes were clearly enhanced comprehensively in an instant shortly afterward and Chang used a fierce claw strike slashing directly at K Shu this hit is for all the suffering I have endured in the past at this moment kenu was like a fish on a chopping board completely suppressed by anang damn it his attacks are like a rainbow konu gritted his teeth in this overwhelming situation konu couldn't use any items in time this next blow is for all the humans who have died at the hands of monsters while speaking enang Yu stomped the fire Fierce worm crushing Kono straight into the ground creating a tremendous explosion after a series of continuous moves K Shu in the enhanced form of the evil dragon was left with only 12% of his health this is just too oppressive kenu furiously shouted despicable humans you don't even speak of Ethics Chen Shu clearly felt this ability of mine is truly an omnidirectional suppression if it continues like this I will definitely die he told himself we must think of another way thinking this K shell tended to Flap his wings and Escape but just as he lifted up yiu appeared above him completely blocking his Escape Route immediately after yiu took out the item that the monkey had used keano realized there was no chance left to flee so he desperately concentrated all his strength to commit suicide however at that very moment and Chang's taming collar was activated completely controlling K Shu a feeling of Despair enveloped him I can't run away and I can't even die and Chang was far from satisfied he quickly made Tron Shu drink a healing potion watching and sneering want freedom do you think I would allow you to die daring to lay a hand on my sister do you think a death penalty is lenient enough it was indeed a bizarre psychological game on one side and chain frantically healed Kon Shu while on the other side he struck at the critical points causing it to wail in despair what are you doing what do you really want thus and Chang continued to beat and heal non-stop for 2 hours in the end the system announced the target has been tamed becoming a pet and a common pet there is no need to borrow the account void beast king the master can still use it you think taming pure is this also acceptable senior I really have underestimated you after chian Sho finished dealing with it the goat demon looked up and asked what should we do next The Tigress replied of course we should go kill that ancient god damn it Tigress is right let's just kill it suzaku also completely agreed compared to being stagnant in evolution I'd rather not be controlled by the ancient god regarding the fate of our monster Clan therefore King long colluding with the ancient God must be killed ywu handed Annie over to enang and said no for the time being we shouldn't act recklessly the internal situation regarding King long is still not clear enough we don't even know what scheme it has with the ancient god right now the most important thing is to unify the will of the monster Clan another monster spoke up whatever you say we will do we all listen to you even me Yi Wu nodded slightly his voice becoming serious although I randomly acquired power from the ancestral monsters I do not intend to interfere with the Consciousness or development of your monster Clan your future is yours to control the monsters knelt down their eyes filled with respect as as they looked at Yu one of them spoke up Cain you are considering us like this again to be loyal to a Cain like you is our honor and it is also the blessing of the entire monster Clan voices of agreement echoed King we humbly ask you to continue leading us your will is our will the path you guide us on is the future of the entire monster Clan ye W nodded his voice solemn right now I truly have a matter that requires your help I need the power of monsters to help restore the dragon body bringing it back to its peak State no one hesitated all in unison willing we are willing Cain please take our strength this is the greatest honor for us another one quickly interjected mine too King please accept our strength the Praises rang out everywhere monster King monster King all the monsters began to transfer their power to ywu just a few seconds later a system sound echoed account has been fully charged power of monster 100% the host can use the dragon body again in King Long Hall the energy of the dragon body reappeared with great Majesty the original energy of K sha had completely vanished in a dark corner a gloomy voice Rose what is that useless Ken show doing I gave it the right to use the treasure yet it hasn't brought back even a bit of intelligence he said how can you remain so calm Cal your plan will fail because of one person the ancient god replied calmly that is not an ordinary person I guess even you cannot handle him hearing this King long was Furious are you underestimating me the last time I failed was only because I had not revealed My True Form if I the ancient god interrupted those things are not important right now you have my power and you will definitely not lose although my power has not fully recovered to its peak like before over the years I have nurtured it enough she continued it's time to start the war the final plan will begin right now W it this is a hundred years earlier than our original plan it seems this time you truly feel the threat King long nodded thoughtfully the ancient god reminded caution is essential do not let the underestimation of a mere human cause our Thousand-Year plan to fail we must seize this opportunity in the Lord Mansion of the goat demon the world Stone had recovered 90% yiu smiled looking towards the ancient god this is all your achievement only you could have done this you have brought hope back to our monster Clan once again seeing the path to the Future the goat demon bowed its head and thanked y wo saying not only do you possess extraordinary strength that other Patriarchs cannot compare to but you also have a wisdom that even I lack with a strongman like you I am willing to serve wholeheartedly the suzaka great Elder also spoke of up I always thought that the strength of our monster Clan comes from continuous killing to achieve power but after meeting you I realized that such strength pales in comparison to your strength that transcends space losing to you does not bring us shame on the contrary we feel very honored The Tigress standing nearby clarified it is not the strength that transcends space But the strength of ye wo this is also the reason why the dragon Elder chose to manifest in yiwu rather than in any of us it proves that the Elder recognizes his abilities and will y Wu is indeed the future of our monster Clan the white tyer nodded and added what sister said is true but next when will we go to eliminate the traitor King long at this moment yiu finally spoke there is no need to rush right now I have a very big question about the monster gate what is the true meaning in relationship between the monster gate and the monster Clan along with the ancient gods since ancient time times the ancient god and dragon engaged in a fierce battle after the dragon's demise his body transformed into a monster giving rise to the current world of monsters at the same time the remnants of the ancient God's Soul were sealed within the monster gate a portal left behind by the Dragon the monster gate not only has the ability to seal the ancient god but can also Traverse space connecting to other worlds but what would happen if the monster gate were destroyed is there a risk of completely unleashing the ancient God's power y Wu continued to question if the complete World Stone can destroy the monster gate could it also be used as a key to unlock a new dimension outside of the human world could the future of the Monster Race lie in that new dimension these words left all the Patriarchs present in astonishment the goat demon spoke wisdom this is the wisdom I always pursued but never attained with such limited information you have drawn such conclusions your cross-dimension thinking makes us appear as beings driven solely by Primal desires Yu humbly replied the power of the Dragon does not provide clear information what I say is merely speculation the GOP demon prays that is already quite impressive no wonder you are the one I admire oh no you are the human I am willing to submit to he said according to current intelligence it can be known that the ancient God has opened a gateway to the human world but how did it do this as for the monsters in the human world today they are likely descendants of the ancient monsters that once attacked Humanity a long time ago and have not returned in short before the truth is clear the monster gate absolutely cannot be destroyed the goat demon said thank you for your appearance and Analysis if you had not come we would have undoubtedly been intent on destroying the monster gate if what you say is correct I could truly become the sinner who destroys the entire future of the monster Clan he pondered for a moment and inwardly said no even if you hadn't come with my intellect I would have inevitably thought of these things sooner or later moreover no matter what we have come this far perhaps this is our destiny the goat demon thought to himself powerful yet not arrogant this is truly the greatest wisdom ye woo indeed you can guide our monster Clan towards a correct future he turned to the great elders and ordered so next this matter cannot be delayed please gather all our forces to protect the monster gate well right the goat demon added you all should also take the world stone with you to prevent any eventuality prepare an additional hand it is definitely not wrong The Tigress asked anxiously what about you of course I will go find King long the other person replied The Tigress reminded King long is not easy to deal with right now it even has the ancient god as a backing you must definitely be careful but what I mean is don't let her the feminine part of you get hurt the person nodded to reassure don't worry soon after enang rushed in speaking firmly yay woo I will go with you last time King long exploited my body and harmed my sister this debt I must settle with it suddenly a violent Tremor shook from outside what's happening what happened hexi my sheep hurriedly ran into report it's not good outside the sky and Earth are cracking open lightning storms and lava are appearing everywhere it's like the end of the world is coming the entire group immediately ran outside a horrifying scene lay before them what is happening why is everything turned into this in an instant it's over everything is finished our world is about to collapse at that moment from the depths of the earth king long emerged it was in a mutated form at a level so high could not be measured only a question mark appeared King long said finally I have waited for this day I have planned for this for thousands of years now is the time to carry out the great cleansing of the monster world haha foolish ones you are being controlled by a human I will wipe you all off this world after that there will only be me only I can lead the monster Clan to a completely new and bright future the male tiger shouted in Anger Dam it King long you betrayed the monster tribe joining some ancient god you still don't feel ashamed and dare to bite us back King long just die don't delay my killing of the ancient god suzaku also spoke coldly saying look at this current scene is this the bright future you speak of King long you are the real sinner of our monster Clan yiu thought to himself K Shu once had the ability to transform and artifacts that surpass what monsters could create all of this must be under the silent manipulation of the an icient God looking at King Long's current state he must have been completely altered by the ancient god at this moment the great Elders were ready to fight the goat demon said vwoo you should not strike first let King long the great Elder handle this you should conserve your strength for the final battle against the ancient god king long disdainfully said you are not even worthy to solo with me suddenly from within King Long's body three Lords who had previously died unexpectedly appeared they were D2 raccoon Fire Tiger and hornwood dragon all at the level of 380 this left goat demon utterly astonished hornwood Dragon wasn't it dead in the Civil War before why is it appearing here ywu questioned with curiosity in fact hornwood Dragon was the number one strategist under the true king long someone explained Keanu merely took its position after hornwood Dragon died another Lord spoke up everyone must conserve their strength to deal with the true Mastermind behind the scenes the ancient god is now the time we must fight for the king please let us fight together the opponent only has three Lords the advantage is on our side I have nothing to fear a confident voice echoed D rat said though old and weak I am willing to contribute a part of my strength to the great cause of the king all three Lords immediately charged in but before they could even act they were exter terminated by hornwood dragon with just one strike seeing this the remaining four Lords did not hesitate poring all their strength into the battle for the righteous cause wait you all Pig strong said what are we waiting for our compatriots are being killed how can we remain indifferent I have thick skin and strong flesh to lead the way and everyone attacks fiercely behind me like this but they can't withstand a single blow what's going on ple chicken said tremble Mr Pig strong couldn't block even one strike all of them are Lords why is the gap in strength so vast over here the other three Lords were also wiped out in an instant the Lord with the lowest level everyone was ambushed in the blink of an eye heartt Moon fox said it's our turn now heart Moon Fox then added clearly scared to this extent yet still wanting to go and seek death just relying on passion and loyalty is useless one must stand up oneself noticing the situation was precarious goat demon Unleashed all his strength and officially took action himself several hundred years ago goat demon began I relied on my own strength to become the number one Lord but the cost of war is often loneliness and suffering I have killed too many way too many comrades and since then we have borne this limit on our power afterwards I established a conservative faction aligning with the Lords who share this vision I initially didn't want to recklessly seek blud anymore but I absolutely cannot allow my compatriots to sacrifice in vain he said as soon as the Fire Tiger charged in the goat demon swung his sword unleashing a huge flame that engulfed him however he did not die he was left as a mere skeleton haha after hundreds of years the goat demon finally chose to be serious ha the Fire Tiger laughed heartily his voice filled with mockery but now you no longer rely on your instinct to kill like before instead you wield your sword out of a sense of responsibility this kind of Sword cannot kill me as he spoke he pushed hard sending the goat demon flying away at that moment D2 racon charged in joining the attack am I hearing this right you once a god of Slaughter now swing your sword for others haha what a great joke the Fire Tiger laughed our monster Clan has always sought absolute power useless companions are nothing more than chains that bind your hands and feet you are all mistaken the goat demon coldly replied I do not wield my sword for anyone it is they who have become my sword what binds me is not a heart of killing but there will as soon as he finished speaking the goat demon caused molten lava to erupt violently from the ground countless white skeletons of monsters Rose from beneath the Earth charging towards the Fire Tiger the tribesmen I have killed seal their hatred within my power feel it together with me feel the suffering like hell with those words the goat demon struck fiercely towards the two Lords the heat surged violently enough to melt their bones the male tiger engaged in battle with the hornwood dragon couldn't help but be astonished by the power of the goat demon damn it the goat demon is single-handedly fighting against two mutants and still completely overpowering them his tactics and strength are not inferior to any of the great Elders like us the intensity of his flame the level of heat and ability could even be compared to suzaku if I had thought about it before with this level of power he is more than qualified to be one of the great Elders on the other side King Long's opponent was suzaku revealing all of his strength King long a defeated foe before me from the great battle hundreds of years ago didn't I already mess up your mind look at the current state of our world look at you now neither ghost nor monster neither demon nor demon is this what you wanted I will not advise you to stop because I will kill you right now seeing suzaku in this state yiu was quite surprised he thought to himself this is the true fighting stance of suzaku does that mean she hadn't used her full power when she fought me before could it be that she only did that to get the monster to submit suzaku looked at Yu her voice cold thanks to my divine power you could become stronger but your feathers and Bones will eventually turn to ashes in the flames I will completely purify you as she spoke suzaku immediately transformed into her final form the flame Phoenix she screamed die King long immediately after suzaku used weather Flint shooting fiery rocks towards King long on the other side King long dodged while sneering turn to ashes Heaven and Earth is originally a furnace everything in the world endures torment within it this world is beyond saving the only way is to prevent the monster Clan from evolving further pushing us into despair he paused for a moment his voice full of determination only when this world is destroyed under my guidance can the monster Clan rebuild and step into a true future despair is not frightening what is frightening is running away from it as long as we bravely face it we will always find a way to continue evolving he said the legend says that suzaku evolves stronger each time it is reborn compared to the Great War several hundred years ago suzaku has become far more terrifying before King long could even react suzaku shot countless fiery Rays straighted him using the dissipate the flame curse a suzaku you fundamentally don't understand anything not everyone can be like you and reincarnate King long sneered his eyes filled with Defiance after saying this he transformed into battle mode the power radiating from his body shaking the very heavens and earth king long morphed into a demonic dragon form his gigantic body twisting exuding a pressure that caused the ground to tremble I invite you to invade the human world together you say you have no interest in eating humans when I suggest in releasing the weakest monsters to devour them and make the strong even stronger you refuse to attack your own kin King long gritted his teeth his eyes flashing with rage as he spoke he Unleashed a stream of Elemental transformation Thunder toward suzaku igniting the air in a fierce configration so what if I borrow power from ancient gods you say I am weak that I am a sinner how can you fabricate everything King long roared his voice like thunder right you are noble you are pure you are truly wonderful but if you are so skilled then kill me if you can do it just do it he laughed loudly his eyes filled with Madness as if challenging both Heaven and Earth with suzaku's speed King long could not approach her at all suzaku said this isn't your reason for doing evil and betraying the monster Clan King long you can only blame yourself for not being strong enough which led you down this irreversible path on the other side the goat demon panded heavily and thought in the end I still had to rely on my ultimate killing technique to defeat these two mutated Lords but I have also exhausted myself greatly and now I have no strength left to fight the goat demon continued to worry just the Lord who has obtained the power of an ancient god after after mutation is already so strong so how terrifying would the true power of an ancient god be meanwhile the white tiger had just finished dealing with the hornwood drot and grumbled damn it a mutated Lord infected by the power of an ancient god is even stronger than great Elders like us if it weren't for my cooperation with tigess it would truly be difficult to determine the outcome of the battle he chuckled softly and added of course it primarily depends on how incredible my Tigress is even a mutated Lord is so strong yet suzaku could still match King long in combat even overpowering him by a level finally the white tiger sighed just how strong is she really it's sad that we are all great Elders yet we are completely inferior to suzaku by a level returning to the battle between King long and suzaku at this moment King long helplessly roared damn it I'd come this far what for why can't I defeat you damn it powerless and Furious is this hard to understand you only rely on outside forces which means your own weakness suzaku said nothing continuing to attack King long forcing him back towards the mountain side at this point King long only had one final option to deal with suzaku but it would cost him his sanity he thought to himself I never intended to do this because if I overuse it I will be controlled by the ancient god all this time I had only used a fraction of its power but now I can't care Much Anymore the monsters across the land have long been permeated and absorbed by the ancient god turning into distorted Power King long shouted right now whatever power there is from the ancient god I will absorb it all this is because you forced me now I just want to destroy you to wash away the humiliation from before King long began to continuously absorb the power from the ancient god a terrifying Force radiated from him making suzaku feel danger as well suzaku murmured is this the power of the ancient god even though I've avoided the danger it's still strong enough to extinguish my flame King long is maddeningly absorbing like this I'm afraid you will soon lose control but I I also cannot easily admit defeat while suzaku was distracted King long suddenly grabbed her wing with his claws and shot straight down he shouted maniacally die die I want to crush you with the power of the ancient god Yu seeing this scene was extremely worried and intended to rush in he quickly said this is not good suzaku is about to lose I have to help her but suddenly a voice echoed in Yu's mind no you don't need to take action a corrupted monster like thing long must be dealt with by me personally Yu was surprised to realize that suzaku was communicating with him through his Consciousness he wondered this is the space of my Consciousness how can you connect with my mind suzaku explained because within your body lies Dragon power I and this power once had a special connection you were smart you must have realized this long ago previously when I fought you it was just to make all monsters believe in you that's why you won so easily YW asked in astonishment Dragon you have had a connection with Dragons suum nodded and recounted I was born From the Ashes of the fire something transformed from the body of a dragon after thousands of years of evasion even as the world around evolved and developed I remained indifferent and aloof she said I always feel Bound by the confines of the Monster World so I constantly strive to soar higher to break free from the sky yet an invisible force seems to pull me down making it impossible for me to break through I don't know how many years have passed but with the increase in my inner strength I finally broke the chains of this world and flew out of it I drifted in the dark un universe and eventually realize the truth outside the Monster World there is only one planet the sun beyond that sun there is nothing else filled with despair I flew straight toward the Sun as my body gradually melted in its intense heat I unexpectedly caught a glimpse of the hazy silhouette of a dragon flickering in the brilliant Flames instead of being completely incinerated I was reborn from those scorching Flames since that moment I gained the ability to resurrect born From the Ashes I knew this was surely the power granted by the dragon but why did he do so what secrets are hidden in that Soul son after my rebirth I was revered and revered by all monsters people called me the great Elder she said but I actually don't care much about this reputation yet after King long stirred things up he has challenged me countless times he wants to fight me to determine who truly dominates the monster world but I have never been interested in this matter however later on he became too much of a nuisance so I chose to fight him once I won the battle against King long and I had no intention of killing him but just as I was turning to leave I was ambushed by King long he used some mysterious power and attacked me from behind at that moment I still didn't know that the Power King long was using was the power of the ancient god I relied on my reincarnation ability to resurrect once again but this reincarnation drained a tremendous amount of energy from me I knew that with my strength at that time it was impossible to kill King long when I saw King long so frightened that he knelt down begging for mercy I played along and pretended to spare his life what I wanted was to return to my true Peak State and then sell the score with him now is the opportunity for Revenge so don't interfere I must avenge this Grudge returning to the battle at this moment King long had pinned suzaku down and Was preparing for a final lethal blow suzaku this time I am the winner I am the one who wins in the end haha immediately a terrifying Force erupted from suzaku's body pushing King long far away no everything is just beginning but it will end quickly szoku spoke with a firm tone as soon as she finished speaking she immediately flew up using her foot to grab King long this took King long by surprise but he still tried to maintain a confident demeanor your struggles are in vain the more hope you have the more desp Fair you'll feel as long as I kill you there will be no one left to challenge me in this world of monsters no not just monsters all of humanity will bow at my feet ignoring King Long's arrogant words suzaku held him tightly while quickly opening a teleportation formation without hesitation suzuku pulled King long into it the destination of the teleportation was none other than the sun seeing this King long was utterly panicked wait this is the Sun what the hell are you planning to do let me go damn it let me go King long strugg fiercely shouting do you know I have planned for this for years you cannot ruin it despite his thrashing suzako used all her strength to push King long straight into the core of the Sun both hurdling into a realm of annihilation King long screamed in despair based on what based on what do you have the ability to reincarnate resurrect and continuously evolve from the moment you were born he said I can only borrow tactics and strength from the outside world even though I have abandoned myself doing everything I still gain nothing King long screamed as he melted completely until he fused into the sun I refused to accept this I refused to accept this after King long was defeated suzuku was reborn From the Ashes once again in the end everything seemed to be over suzaku breathed a sigh of relief but just at that moment something unexpected appeared grabbing her body I never expected my plan to go so smoothly haha that thing all too familiar was the ancient god did you really think my plan was simply to absorb power from the Monster World in fact the power of the monster world has long ceased to satisfy me even exploiting the blood essence of humanity is not enough the only thing that can satisfy me as king long and those like him the ancient god laughed loudly I could never escaped the bindings of this world but then I accidentally discovered the secret of your rebirth from within the sun therefore I Enchanted King long to challenge you last time the plan failed because King Long's strength was insufficient but this time I have bestowed my power upon Him finally I can push you to your limits at this moment suzaku struggled but could not escape from his grasp the ancient god sneered and said all of this is part of my plan finally I have arrived at this Planet here I can absorb even greater energy haha little bird thank you for helping me break free from the constraints of that other world now you are no longer of any use so die his plan was to sneak inside kinglong then use suzaku to bring himself to the sun in order to absorb the tremendous energy from it but what he did not anticipate was the appearance of Yu after saving suzaku yigu smiled faintly and said how long has it been how long has it been since I last stroll on this planet this feeling truly brings back memories Yu known as The Immortal Baldhead Emperor woo had transformed from an ordinary person into the strongest strongman in just two short years he directly broke through to the highest level able to walk on the surface of the planet with a body intensity reaching the realm of divinity exceedingly solid Yu looked around the scenery and casually said the wind on this planet still Roars like it did before the ancient god looked at ywu stunned and speechless is it you did you also use suzaku's teleportation formation to come here with me but how could you do that y Wu silently thought although I know he is definitely not an ordinary person he is truly exceeded my imagination he turned to suzaku and said I promised not to interfere in the battle between you and King long but now please hand over this ancient god to me after all I really enjoy collecting ancient gods suzaku gently nodded muttering all right just the body of a human but able to withstand the surface temperature of the planet the ancestors of dragons the hair you chose is really just a human at that moment the system suddenly sounded an announcement that left YW stunned affected by planetary level energy unlocking the dragon heart account YW could not hide his Joy really is there actually such good news the system continued to explain since the founding of the monster world the body of the Dragon has transformed into the land that nurtures them the heart of the Dragon has become the light Illuminating the entire monster realm now two special accounts have merged unlocking the restricted level gold Emperor Dragon account ye W murmured in amazement restricted level account is this the complete form of power of the Dragon truly wonderful this new account is simply top-notch he looked up at the sky his eyes filled with determination this day has finally come the final battle between you and me is unavoidable the ancient God said the final battle how ridiculous this is merely your final battle I have been planning for countless times this time I will undoubtedly surpass you and you Dragon who only borrowed the human body to awkwardly resurrect how can you be my opponent the fists of the two clashed creating a massive explosion in the endless void the powerful shock wave pushed both of them far away the ancient god thought to himself the driving can use the human body to push me back indeed if I do not regain my Peak power won't that still be insufficient below the monsters looked up in astonishment the planet level explosions continued to occur in the sky leaving everyone bewildered a monster shouted oh my God the sky is exploding could it be that the Battle Above has already begun damn it it's too far away I can't see anything clearly the white tiger coldly said that's only because your levels are too low your strength is insufficient I could see very clearly too terrifying damn it those two just exchanged a few blows and created such a large explosion this level of combat even our great Elders cannot intervene in contrast to the male tiger Fear The Tigress was only worried for the female version of ywu vwu you must be careful please do everything you can to avoid getting hurt back to the battle between ywu and the ancient God at this moment the ancient god was absorbing energy from the planet to restore his full strength he laughed loudly saying Dragon I rely on the planet with its endless power to absorb what about you are you just draining the power of that weak human body haha as soon as he finished speaking the ancient god immediately used blood flame fery creating countless red threads that shot straight at yiu yiu quickly deployed the Dragon Emperor Thunder aray for defense he calmly replied absorbing the planet's energy to enhance yourself is this the final trump card you've been hiding the ancient god sneered arrogantly so what if it is you must have your own trump card as well if you're not dead yet then use it quickly you won't have another chance haha yiu smirked faintly just as the ancient god finished speaking Yu's Dragon Emperor Thunder array was shattered the bloodflame fairy immediately wrapped tightly around around him however y Wu maintained the calm expression and gently said you truly have not changed before achieving anything you are already boasting have you forgotten whose power you are relying on from the planet y Wu immediately unleashed the Dragon Emperor of Thunder slash cutting through all the strands clinging to him the remaining sword energy continued to Surge straight toward the ancient god before countering the attack the ancient god scoffed and said I actually want to take your wool in intending to use it against you so what just as the Dragon Emperor Thunder slash swept in the ancient god raised both hands to defend he shouted loudly break for me the Dragon Emperor Thunder slash was swiftly shattered immediately after the ancient god continued to absorb the power of the planet he spoke with a firm voice Dragon I was able to kill you once before now I can certainly kill you again the ancient god opened a spatial formation using the strands to bind yiu tightly within it at this moment yiu found himself entirely on the defensive without hesitation the ancient god utilized the DL planet to attack Yu creating a horrific explosion in the expansive space on this side suzaku was filled with worry as she witnessed Dragon yiu being pushed into a weak position she thought to herself how can this be the dragon Elder can't even defeat the ancient god no that's wrong the rebirth power previously the dragon had bestowed me with power helping me achieve the strength of rebirth he must have shared his power with the other great Elders as well Su Aku thought for a moment then used the sound transmission technique to s a white tiger white tiger the dragon Elder must have distributed the power to you in the past now is the time for us to gather that power and give it to him for assistance this was suzaku's voice transmitted through consciousness suzaku what should we do white tiger asked suzaku replied pour your power into the patriarch's token and then bring that token here hearing this male tiger and Tigress immediately poured all their strength into the token after that Tigress worriedly asked but how do we get the token over we don't have the ability to Traverse space like you male tiger took the token laughing loudly Tigress leave it to me at this moment it has to be simple and strong using strength to create a miracle as soon as he finished speaking he threw the token with all his might towards Yu suzaku also took out two tokens he was holding the token of swan Wu must be with Yi Wu I killed Kan long obtained his token along with mine that should be enough having said that suzaku threw both tokens towards Yu after gathering enough four tokens the system immediately rang out with the announcement four tokens have been collected the the great Elder has gathered enough power successfully reclaiming the energy release as soon as the system finished speaking a tremendous Force exploded from within yiu shattering all the bindings of the ancient god my attack has been deflected the ancient god exclaimed in front of him was the dragon in the ultimate form of the golden Emperor Dragon the strongest form of the Dragon no it can't be I had planned meticulously and until now everything was under control I cannot fail at this decisive moment the ancient god screamed frantically launching attacks the four elephants wore bellowed creating powerful sound waves that caused every attack from the ancient god to Veer off course the golden Emperor dragon roar also let out a loud roar shattering all the ancient gods techniques immediately after the dragon charged directly at the ancient god wrapping around him preparing for a devastating Counterattack at this point the ancient god was completely controlled by the dragon left with no strength to fight back after tightly wrapping around the ancient god the dragon immediately bit into his flesh you have humiliated my monster Clan too deeply today I will eat your flesh shatter your bones cut your tendons and drink your blood the dragon laughed cruy the ancient god could only helplessly watch everything unfold unable to do anything to escape his fate at this moment the ancient god used the planet's energy to create ate more clones I came from a higher Dimension and had long discarded my fragile body as much energy as the planet has I can create that many clones can you consume them all the dragon laughed loudly ha let's see after saying that he used the technique four symbols shooting line unleashing a powerful attack in an instant all of the ancient gods clones were completely annihilated the ancient god curled his lips into a faint smile my clones are gone but Dragon you didn't have such methods back then by merging into a human body you have become stronger the dragon replied his gaze I see human this person is not ordinary you cannot Define him with just the word human if not why do you think I chose him as soon as he finished speaking the dragon swung his tail severing a part of the ancient God's body however in the blink of an eye the ancient God's body automatically reconnected completely unharmed the ancient god raised an eyebrow a puzzled expression on his face what exactly is he why did you choose him the dragon fell silent and did not respond the ancient god clenched his fists angrily shouting what does it have to do with me I am not reconciled I have lurked in this low-level World scheming for so long and just when success was in sight I failed it's so unfair the ancient God's eyes burned red as he frantically absorbed the planet's energy you want to protect the world you created right if I can't have it then no one can damn it everyone don't dream you w shouted in panic he's gone mad the ancient god is frantically absorbing energy from the planet without regard for the consequences the dragon charged forward to attack the ancient god but all efforts were in vain the ancient god continued to absorb energy relentlessly go ahead and hurt each other in the end we'll all perish together the ancient God laughed hardly I want to drag this entire world down with me haha y wo and the dragon rushed to stop him this is not good we have to stop him Yu said in panic the dragon gritted his teeth stop him who in this world can stop him the ancient god immediately shot a gigantic meteor towards the dragon the force of the attack was so powerful that both were thrown back unable to approach the ancient god when ywu and the dragon re gained their composure they were horrified to realize that the ancient God had merged with the planet his body had grown thousands of times larger than before completely transformed the ancient god roared the dragon must die you humans must die all the monsters in this world must die let's destroy everything together haha below the monsters trembled at the terrifying sight one of them exclaimed damn it he truly wants to perish with the entire world of monsters another monster gritted its teeth and said we must trust the monster King he will definitely have a way to deal with this monster the monster said what the hell is there to trust even the monster world is coming to an end what can he do now it's all over we are all about to die haha no one can escape we all must die with me Yu looked at the scene before him his voice filled with worry because the energy of the star has been depleted by the ancient god it is now converted ing into a white dwarf or possibly a supernova its gravitational force is pulling matter back to the core what is happening here the dragon Stood Beside him his expression contemplative but could not hide his concern he said it seems that this star no matter how much it is the dragon's heart ultimately cannot escape the laws of the universe the reaction intensified the gravitational force from the Star not only caused surrounding matter to collapse but also affected the dragon Yu shouted urgently we must withdraw immediately otherwise we'll be pulled in both of them intended to run but it was too late the dragon was held tightly by the gravitational force unable to move he tried his best to push y Wu away and shouted loudly go y wo your future is filled with infinite possibilities I can't go with you anymore Yi wo was stunned desperately trying to pull the dragon but helpless he shouted in despair no I can't leave you VI alone the dragon smiled faintly but his gaze was Resolute don't waste time ye woo if you don't leave now we will both die here live on and for me explore the other wonders of the universe Yu gritted his teeth tears rolling down his cheeks in the end he had to turn his back and run away leaving the dragon gradually disappearing into the blinding light of the Supernova my useless descendants are relying on you I hope you can lead the entire Monster Race to a righteous f future proving that I did not choose the wrong person as he spoke the drivein used all his remaining strength to push y Wu away he himself merged into the star sacrificing himself along with the ancient god Dragon at that moment suduku appeared using its foot to pick up y Wu then created a formation to fly back to the Monster World we must go now after suzaku returned Yi woo the monsters were extremely excited all shouting monster Cain you have returned turned monster King monster King at this moment Yu commanded the goat demon goat demon quickly use the world Stone to fully activate the monster gate yes obeying the king the goat demon replied then place the world Stone in quickly activating the monster gate successfully King the monster gate has been successfully activated the goat demon reported immediately yeu ordered all monsters heed my command enter the monster gate and leave this place however the monsters hesitated not daring to step inside seeing this suzaku shouted why are you still standing there do you not hear the command of the monster King the monster said King suzaku great Elder it's not that we don't want to follow the order to leave but where exactly is behind the monster gate we don't know if it's a desolate land completely uninhabitable or even a place of death what should we do we are worried y Wu snapped angrily the dragon Elder has sacrificed once again for your futures are you really going to give up for nothing you must seize this opportunity I will absolutely not allow you to give up there is no more time left do you want to stay here and wait for death under the influence of the incredibly strong gravitational force the monster world is also gradually being sued into the Supernova back in the human world in a wild area where refugees gathered the alarm Bells rang out signaling a monster attack everyone quickly pack your belongings try to bring along valuable and lightweight items we must evacuate immediately in a small family the woman anxiously said brother what exactly is going on recently there have been constant refugees coming from other places to us I heard that several Gathering areas nearby have been destroyed by monster attacks it's not safe here anymore but we have been here for over 10 years can we really just leave she continued father mother where are we going where to even father and mother don't know but you don't need to worry no matter where we go mom and dad will be here our family will always be together yes just a few minutes later the protective barrier was broken by the monster they surged in this is not good the monsters are breaking in a Savage laugh echoed haha we thought that the two LED goats nearby had been wiped out but but it turns out there are still some left here today we'll get to eat well ah help me the small family that had planned to escape was caught off guard they have been targeted by a level 50 monster where do you think you're going why aren't you introducing yourselves to me as soon as the words left its mouth it raised its Scythe aiming straight at the standing man bringing it down don't be afraid I just want to pierce you through then dismember you tearing your limbs apart letting your blood spray through the the air oh how wonderful it is to think about that just as the Scythe was about to strike the man a voice suddenly rang out in its head stop the monster was startled confused whose voice is this why is it appearing in my head before it could grasp what was happening its Consciousness was shifted to another place what the hell is this where is this again ye wo stood on a cliff looking down below then use sound transmission technique to speak to all the monsters on Earth all monsters immediately cease your bloodthirsty Rampage and Slaughter of humanity you are all descendants of the monsters from the Monster World a higher dimensional space Enchanted by opponents from a higher space you have invaded the human world through the monster gate but do you know in the Monster World a new King has emerged he leads the monster tribe to fight against the adversaries behind the scenes leading to the destruction of both the Monster World and those responsible for it however at the last moment the new king under the guidance of the monster Elder Dragon brought the monsters back to what is considered the true Homeland the monster tribe that place is the realm of Consciousness that you are seeing right now the monster Clan has found its true future if you remain in the human world relinquish your blood lust and killing to embrace a new future Shadow sight sneered his voice brimming with arrogance so what what happened in the monster world has nothing to do with the monsters in our human world we have raised our swords ready for a hearty feast and yet you pull our Consciousness here you make such a big commotion just to say these words ye woo bellod this is not advice but a command damn it who do you think you are seeing many arrogant monsters refusing to submit yiwu immediately used the pressure of the monster King to explain to them he declared monster King I am the new king leading the monster Clan towards a true future which means I am the king of all you monsters I under the title of monster King command all monsters in the human world retract your thirst for blood and cease the killings in the wilderness of this world as soon as the command was issued all monsters knelt down and paid their respects they felt deeply that this command was etched into their very Souls one monster whispered no doubt he is not lying he is the true monster King the ruler of all our monsters meanwhile the shadow sight's fate Shadow filled with fear knelt down in Repentance damn it I dared to resent the monster King I almost disobeyed the command damn it how much longer can I live like this no I feel I must Salvage the situation I must quickly make amends for my mistake immediately the shadow psych moved up to a small family hurriedly saying I was just joking with you all monsters and humans are all one family right Shadow Sy said father mother W little sister oh no my biological little sister this is the first time visiting and I didn't bring any gifts how about this I will give you this sword to play with seeing that the little girl immediately burst into tears oh oh don't cry I understand you don't want to be called little sister right all right from now on you can be sister and I will be little brother okay he turned and shouted loudly what are you all standing there for have you forgotten why we are here we need to renovate the old house now that the old one has been destroyed we have to quickly build a new one for the family immediately the monsters began to work together on building the new house one person spoke up let's make it beautiful to the point where even the fairies wouldn't want to leave in another place Moi n started a video call with Yu she anxiously said vwoo this is troublesome I have sent many people to search all over the safe Zone but we still can't find the teleportation device that the monsters have hidden yiwu cly replied don't worry you won't have to worry about the monsters anymore because Yu recounts the entire story in detail after listening Moi joyfully exclaims what can you really do this even so since it's you I don't find it too hard to believe this means that from now on the greatest threat to humanity has been eliminated we are truly preparing to enter a new era Yuans and response in fact the greatest crisis always arises from the internal struggles among humans the external crisis are merely superficial you are worried about the east region aren't you don't worry I've mobilized all forces to closely monitor the situation and control all movements from that area Moi n sigh softly I'm not worried about them causing trouble I'm just lamenting the fate of humanity as a whole yiu suddenly remembers something important and says all right there's something I want to ask of you please try to gather all the fragments of the world stone m immediately agrees the task you assign I will definitely do my best rest assured I always pay attention to everything you request ywo Smiles feeling grateful thank you very much after delegating the tasks Yi Wu sits down to summarize the missions that have been completed currently he has collected five out of the 13 ancient gods including the Thousand eyed demon God Larin the origin of nature unification and the disaster plagued jubo names like chaos Cadia and alienation transformation tros are still the targets ahead among the remaining ancient gods it is known that there are two names in the east region and one name in the world of lagona dark blood Master Bard the quest the fate of the king to become the seven Great Kings has led me to complete the evil caning and monster King the next goal is to collect the fragments of the world Stone and ancient God while also helping that take revenge and become the mechanical King suddenly a monster transmitted a message King I Am The Wild monster from the East I have a significant Discovery to report to you I am in the Eastern Area outside the safe Zone and from a distance I see a glowing tail and a gigantic iron pillar trailing smoke Rising into the sky this is something I have never seen before hearing this I thought to myself this description res resembles a rocket in ancient technology could it be that the east region is restoring rocket technology the monster continued King do you see it however this large iron pillar seems to be flying slower and slower it appears to be about to fall he speculated it seems that some invisible force is pulling it back perhaps I will go to the east region to stir things up a bit and in the process collect the two ancient gods there at this moment the rocket continued to spew fuel using all its power to break through the limit finally it had flown out of the atmosphere the monster saw it and immediately reported to yiwu it's flying it's flying away yiu thought to himself my plan has unexpectedly been overtaken by the east region however there seems to be some invisible rules enveloping the Earth he told himself I still know too little about this area but the east region certainly knows a lot of information they don't want to reveal I should ask who you y with that in mind y Wu made a video call to H Yu Yi as soon as she answered y Wu asked sister who are you I want to ask for some information did your east region just successfully launch a rocket who are you ye smiled and replied no wonder you are so impressive even in the far off southwest region you know so quickly your methods truly make others admire you how did you manage to do it she continued I am at the launch site you can see for yourself saying that she turned the camera towards the rocket Launchpad there a large crowd was gathered to witness this significant event Yi Wu pondered I originally thought we had been completely locked down on Earth unable to fly into space I never expected that today we actually achieved a breakthrough she said I have said that our east region is the most formidable the east region truly is top-notch on the podium why keido a level 180 individual saw stated since globalization began ancient civilization and technological science have experienced a severe disconnection such events have happened several times in the past for instance the thousands of years of civilization in Babylon were buried in Golden Sands once these civilizations experienced disconnection they were never able to be resurrected however today the achievements that are ancestors never accomplished have been completed by us after hundreds of years of research and Relentless effort the east region has successfully restored ancient space technology we will no longer be limited to this dangerous Earth the first breakthrough today does not belong to all of humanity but solely to the people of the east region with this key technology the east region is sure to become the ruler of all the remaining human civilization his heroic speech filled the entire population of the east region with immense excitement shouts erupted long live the east region long live the east region who are you ye turned to Y wo and said this is roughly the situation on the podium is the boss of the second most powerful organization in the east region way kidu this person is very dangerous so you must be careful in the future she said on the other hand launching surveillance Satellites with the purpose of comprehensively scanning and monitoring the Earth after alization Therefore your previous plan for the super safe area is only a matter of time before it is exposed as soon as you take action huu Yi had not yet finished speaking when the communication system was suddenly disconnected sister hu you the information was suddenly interrupted could it be that something has happened to huu Y with her cunning and determination she should be capable of handling it on her own on the other hand the east region indeed cannot be underestimated they managed to successfully recover rocket technology yigu murmured my understanding of the east region is still too Limited currently Nana's progress in refurbishing and repairing the spaceship has reached 85% I'm not sure if we can finish before the east region discovers us as for the restrictive rules that prevent us from breaking through the sky what exactly happened I must clarify this after thinking for a moment Yi Wun decided to fly up personally to investigate the truth he switched to the immortal bald head account if the Rockets from the east region can successfully take off it means that the sky is not completely impossible to breakthrough it's just that he is still unclear about what these restrictive rules actually are after ascending to a certain height yiu felt as if he was being pulled down the higher he went the clearer the restrictive rules became like a huge invisible hand trying to pull him back to the ground Yu tried to fly a bit further but this time the sensation became incredibly intense damn it what is going on it hurts so much I can't breathe anymore even the system was disturbed by this Force due to the interference of an unknown source of power the account connection failed Yu's account status was about to be revoked when the account was completely revoked yiu lost Consciousness and began to fall freely towards the ground system notification the host is currently in a no account account State based on the current falling acceleration the host will collide with the ground in 30 seconds in a certain Corner two monsters witnessed this scene one spoke up what the hell is that after the sun sets we should quickly make a wish I hope I can be lucky enough to see the appearance of the new king we have never encountered the other one rebutted no way I seem to sense a familiar human energy wait a minute isn't this the energy of our new king it's exactly the same as when he transmitted commands into our souls the monster said what the hell is this I just wanted to play how did it become reality is it really so Supernatural on hurry and go save the King do you want to meet the new king for the first time in his funeral after saying this the two monsters quickly flew off to save Yu at this moment in the monitoring room of the east region the supervisor suddenly shouted in panic the surveillance satellite has entered a low earth orbit and is sending back images wait there seems to be something unusual as he spoke he zoomed in on the images displayed on the screen these are all real-time images of the southwestern safe Zone transmitted by the surveillance satellite white Keo upon hearing this ran over to take a look the images showed significant Construction in the southwestern safe Zone with Transportation networks and clusters of buildings rapidly being erected he looked at the screen with a Sinister expression and said haha the southwestern safe zone is truly Restless it dares to make such underhanded moves behind our east region however your schemes have been discovered by me this time the east region will Target the southwestern zone of ywu first ywu must deal with the east region otherwise the consequences will be extremely serious after whyu discovered the construction in the southwest Zone through satellite data he immediately called Mo zun long the head of the hanm group headquarters in the southwest safe Zone Wu moan long I've heard that you guys are developing quite well in the southwest safe Zone you even Dar to unilaterally remodel the highway but I must say that is a foolish decision Moen long replied coldly why you think that white key do the previous technology of the Southwest safe Zone was all tiered technology that our east region transferred now even though you've stolen a bit of our new technology it's still not enough for you to realize such Grand Ambitions why ke do pause sneering before continuing don't think that with just a little bit of Technology you can surpass us you are pushing yourselves into a dead end he said in terms of developing this technology you should cooperate with our east region since we are the main force in the deployment either directly invest money to purchase our advanced technology or of course we will not agree to that seeing why key do arrogance like that m key M needs older brother immediately replied angrily steal your technology none of you possess this technology did we steal the technology from your future and cooperation you want to take the lead I think you want to seize our techn technology for yourselves why key do continued is it your turn to speak now Mo junr manage your people well don't let it come to a point where the gray haired must send off the own the kind of Reckless development like your Southwestern safe zone is irresponsible towards the other major safe zones you are going to destroy the system you should understand your position based on the existing order rules and not overstep your limits at this moment moan long the father of moai finally spoke the southwestern safe zone is currently under my control and it is not your turn to wag your fingers besides we no longer need you to donate obsolete technology at absorbent prices the development of the southwestern safe Zone only needs to align with the interests of the people in the southwestern safe Zone hearing this he was extremely angry and shouted loudly Mo zun long who gave you the courage to say such words to the east region haha I remember now it's the courage that Yu gave you isn't it you dare to bet all your assets on a kid who still has milk on his breath Moen long you really are an old fool he continued Mo zun long your words today mean you have turned against the east region you must know the consequences of opposing us if that's the case then go ahead with that he hung up the phone Mo zun long wondered how did the east region find out about our construction so quickly m after reading the intelligence from the Spy replied we just received news from the spy in the east region it's the rocket the east region has successfully launched a rocket sending a satellite into space surely this is what led to our Discovery Mo zun long shook his head the east region far surpasses Us in this field it seems their Internal Affairs are truly not something we can compare to right now we can only place our hopes on yiu I trust him because he has never let us down the scene shifts to the east region headquarters of the Black Sea science and technology department haha the leader of the Southwest safe Zone dares to speak so boldly truly making me laugh until my teeth fall out their plan will undoubtedly fail not to mention their outdated technology the impact of both humans and monsters alone is enough to destroy all their constructions one person laughed hardly and continued the Southwest safe zone is truly wasting a large amount of Manpower and resources they have already fallen behind us by a great distance and will only continue to lag further behind let them dig their own Graves we in the east region can sleep soundly haha why ke do the head of the meeting suddenly shouted angrily enough you ignorant fools can't you see the satellite images being transmitted back the Southwest safe Zone has managed to construct to such a level which clearly indicates that the hanmo group has surely overcome significant difficulties regarding humanity and Technology we must send our drag and God group from the Black Sea science and technology department to the Southwest safe Zone to gather intelligence on site and conveniently eliminate that ywo one subordinate questioned Chief the dragon God is the super elite team of the east region are we truly necessary to deploy them just to gather intelligence and assassinate one person why Kido immediately said are you using your stupid head to doubt my arrangements I dare not my Lord I will organize and inform the dragon God group wait contact that guy in the wilderness to be the main Force yes at this moment at the lair of the fly monster the monsters shouted in panic Cain you have finally awoken hurry and report to Grandma King is awake King King the girl here is the king of the fly monsters but her name was not introduced as soon as y Wu woke up they had prepared numerous fruits to welcome him Kain these offerings are what we have gathered from around especially to show our respect to you at that moment all the monsters in this place knelt down in reverence before you woo we humbly request the king to accept the formal tribute of our fly monster tribe greeting King the monsters shouted in unison greeting King greeting King seeing this scene Yu was deeply moved and said it is you all who saved me thank you hearing ye who say this this the monsters were all touched King this is what we should do how can such small monsters like us dare to receive a gratitude they said King thanks us the king actually thanks us oh we cannot have any regrets in this life as long as we could be thanked by the king ignoring these sycophantic monsters y Wu began to worry about the restrictions of Earth there is some kind of restrictive rulle surrounding Earth the closer one gets to the universe the greater this restriction becomes I have confirmed this myself in other words as we approach the universe the pollution of Earth diminishes that is why my accounts abilities could disappear however the Rockets from the east region can break through this restriction this proves that the physical rules closer to the universe are significantly different from those in the original world but why is that the rules allow us to Traverse different dimensions in spaces yet impose strict limitations and confinement in the existing World why is it like this I use my accounts abilities to quickly manufacture Machinery but I fear I also cannot break through the restrictive rules just like n a spaceship which arrived on Earth before it became polluted this is our only opportunity to escape into the universe we must expedite the repair of the spaceship after all it has already been taken over by the east region first while pondering Yu suddenly received a call from Mo zong as soon as he answered Mo zong said gwo the east region has learned about our construction project moreover I have already turned against the east region they will definitely not let this matter go and may even send troops to cause trouble the internal situation of the east region far surpasses that of our southwest region while the ultra secure Zone plan has not yet been completed I am truly worried upon hearing this yiu confidently replied there's no need to worry too much if the people from the east region want to come they must first passed through the secure Zone furthermore the construction there is nearing completion rest assured I will be there to welcome these guests let's see what interesting things their dragon God group has at this moment in the secure Zone number two of Infiniti C everyone was buzzing with discussion who destroyed the Hong Jen group who defeated the infinity group unmatched by anyone who opened the transportation Network throughout the entire Southwestern secure Zone and who rebuilt secure Zone number two while also subduing all the monsters that played the area another person chimed in taking down Wang Jang defeating Infinity connecting the highways subduing monsters and rebuilding secure Zone number two who else could possibly do all these things they all shouted in unison it's him it's him our King our new king ye woo after mque spoke the entire populace began to cheer new king long live Long Live y Wu Lord long live the cheers echoed continuously y Wu also responded long live the people the crowd nearby began to discuss young handsome and Powerful I am crazy about the new king compared to the boys trained by entertainment companies just to please the elite the new king is truly the Dream Lover of mine hurry and take more photos of Yu each night I must H his picture to sleep however there were also quite a few contrasting comments don't celebrate too early the new king may be powerful but the stronger he is the higher the taxes remembered Infinity from before wasn't he strong the taxes were extremely heavy right now the new king is even stronger than infinity the taxes may even be higher changing Kings is just changing the way we are oppressed yiu stepped forward and spoke loudly I Will Not Waste Your Time any further I won't say too many flowery words just remember one thing starting today the door to Safe Zone number two will be open for everyone as long as you are a resident here everyone will be tax exempt for 3 years hearing ye we say that everyone became extremely excited what new king and it's a new king Yu Lord Long Live weren't you just saying something earlier that was earlier now we must shout loudly new king Long Live everyone chanted in unison new king long live long live the atmosphere became very Lively a moment later in the meeting room of safe Zone number two Yi Wu spoke boss I have called the people you need everyone quickly gathered the girl in the purple dress was introduced as Ki the queen of entertainment services the man standing next to her was liai a master in the field of construction studies when everyone had arrived yuku said well the construction of safe Zone number two has been completed next we need to arrange everyone to assign management responsibilities for the areas y will continue to assign tasks liai will be responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure of safe Zone number two Ki is in charge of creating cultural and recreational areas M will be responsible for social relations while also coordinating the continuation of work with the companies the Breaking Bad Club is responsible for the safety of the healthcare area and pharmaceutical Supply the bionic grow group will take care of defense and daily security matters finally Yi Wu turned to Nana and said you should quickly return to the Fortress and speed up the repairs on the spaceship this is an urgent and very important task everyone wholeheartedly accepted their assignments and the working atmosphere became tense after completing the mission the president of the Breaking Bad Club ases approached gu wo and said I do not agree you were asking for my help again but have you forgotten something before I helped you remove the mechanical metalization debuff and gave you the non- antidote at that time you agreed to marry me you took advantage of me like this and now you pretend to have amnesia and refuse to acknowledge it y Wu thought to himself I originally thought you were just joking but I didn't expect that after so long you still remember clearly this is troublesome if I renage on my debt won't it cause more hassle Ames continued but if you sleep with me for one night when you wake up in the morning we can consider it as if no one owes anyone anything moreover I can also comply with your personnel arrangements for the Breaking Bad Club saying that Ames hugged y Wu intimately this scene left everyone around in shock what the hell is going on one person exclaimed I'm so surprised is there really such a thing I mean how unfortunate yiu felt conflicted but didn't know how to refute it in his heart he thought this proposal isn't bad it just needs some tweaking to be acceptable Ames chuckled softly I don't know many things Beyond construction engineering Master if you need bed making warming up or any kind of serving work please just give the orders the atmosphere around them became strange as all eyes turned to iwu Nana suddenly grabbed the bionic girl group's arm breaking it decisively the captain yelled in pain Nana my arm is broken Nana silently fumed in her heart she thought even though I have no no intentions toward y Wu hearing this woman say such things makes me feel extremely uneasy if Yu has a child with her wouldn't he no longer dot on me I am the mechanical Queen Adept and stable how could I possibly compete with a child but I will not agree to this marriage absolutely not mque beside her sensed the tension and broke the atmosphere there are countless women who want to sleep with our eboss if you want him you have to line up how long the line will B that's hard to say KY chimed in there are many men in the world but someone of yiwu's caliber only comes once he shouldn't belong to just one person being alone is a huge waste such Superior genes cannot be wasted Yu then said in a serious tone stop this topic ends here anyone who does not cooperate is fine the development of the Southwest safe Zone has become an Unstoppable trend of the times anyone who does not seize the opportunity if they miss it may find themselves forever unable to catch up hearing Yu say that Ames thought to himself his demeanor has completely changed compared to before he is no longer influenced by anyone no one can control him in front of him Ames pondered now I basically have no opportunity to negotiate or make any demands but I like him better in his current state after that aim said if youve said that I agree with your arrangement I agree with the way he has prepared beforehand using this opportunity to establish a deeper connection later we can gradually develop feelings I must conquer him indeed the heart of a woman is too dangerous if you're not careful you'll lose your bachler hood just like that at this moment y Wu got straight to the main topic next I have one more important matter to inform everyone the east region is about to attack our Southwest safe Zone heing this everyone maintained their calm showing no signs of surprise one person spoke up everyone is so calm which actually surprises me a bit but this was bound to happen sooner or later right moreover I suspect the boss has already thought of a countermeasure right y nodded exactly suddenly a monster messenger came to report your majesty less than 1,000 km from safe Zone number two we have detected a large Convoy heading towards safe Zone number two yiu frowned oh their efficiency is really high it's seems this time they have set their sights on us the scene shifts to the Convoy ha what level is the Southwest safe Zone anyway is it worthy for the number one dong bin team of our Eastern Wasteland to take action themselves although we are just assisting the team from the east region we have arrived let's definitely have a fun battle and directly Wipe Out the entire Southwest safe Zone one person in the Convoy spoke up his tone full of arrogance this was just a one-sided crushing that lacked excitement a bunch of ignorant fools were willingly offering their lives to yiu inside the vehicle of the poison dragon mercenary Corps a man was sitting between two girls he smirked and said this is Captain chel me and mo level 230 boss the Southwest safe Zone must have lost its mind how dare they turn against our east region haha but it's just in time we have wanted to take over the Southwest safe zone for a long time but the higher ups of the East region always stopped us this time they finally let go the one Speaking was the Vice Captain of the poison dragon mercenary cor Li wua Kong level 180 he glanced around and continued the Southwest safe zone is indeed a bunch of idiots completely unaware of their own position do they really think they are on par with the east region in reality they are merely dependents of the east region moreover I have heard rumors that the yiu we plan to convene L eliminate this time is the very person the Southwest safe zone is currently relying on Lee huok Kong laughed loudly haha Yoo how funny while laughing joyfully Shi and mo suddenly said what's with that sad face the higher ups in the east region have promised that this time we can freely stay in the safe zone of the Southwest we can do whatever we want they won't care about anything Li huok Kong began to think the brothers are clearly in High Spirits yet yet the boss says something like that there's clearly a hidden meaning in his words in this apocalypse one must learn to decipher the true intentions behind the boss's words that's also the reason I was able to become the deputy commander of the largest wild mercenary Brigade in the east region after glancing at a mysterious girl Lee wua Kong said isn't it because the bosses of the east region look down on us wild mercenaries they want to cooperate but have to send a girl to supervise show me and mo immediate responded what are you talking about we are all people of the east region this time joining forces to deal with the safe zone of the Southwest is to share a common enemy the boss is right I was narrow-minded I must have misunderstood the intentions of the leaders of the east region he continued even if they want to supervise they couldn't possibly send a girl this girl must be a gift from the boss of the east region for us to use hearing this the other brothers approached teasing And discussing the figure of this girl is truly beautiful it's just that we can't see her face so we can't tell what she really looks like what do you know I heard that those high-ranking bosses play with flowers just like this this is an opportunity for us to experience the pleasures of the upper class Oh indeed a specialized toy for them we tease her like this but the girl doesn't react at all it seems she was taught well in the past today Brothers should have a little fun lever taste a bit of wildness we can't let this little girl look down on us as they were about to touch the girl several beams of light suddenly flashed cutting off the hands of a few people ah my hand after that a group of Assassins appeared standing next to the girl she looked at them and coldly said is this your number one mercenary Squad from the wild east region you couldn't even detect a few hidden subordinates next to me this pack of wild monkeys really disappoints people hearing this Le W Kong roared angrily damn it if you beg me to work you should have the proper attitude what does this mean you dare to touch my people you little brats chop them down and then skin this woman the girl stood up and said coldly you are really impatient just a little teasing and you can't take it I don't lack any flesh in fact as long as the opponent is strong enough I wouldn't mind whatever they want to do to me hearing this the three lecherous men continued to advance trying to flirt me Ren Fang smirked so it turns out you like it rough today I will show you what a real man is brothers let's charge in we will handle her well and take revenge for our injured comrades as they took a step forward the mysterious girl simply waved her hand lightly in an instant all three were chopped into pieces she Chu Them Softly is that all seeing the scene before him Le huok Kong was startled but still shouted angrily you dare to repeatedly look down on us do you really think I'm a pushover I want you dead as luhua kuang prepared to attack sheli and mo quickly intervened all right they are just some reckless subordinates if they are dead then they are dead haha my apologies my apologies we are all Wanderers in the wild they acted out of hotheadedness and if they were unsatisfied they would resort to violence I hope you won't take it to heart we shouldn't harm our harmony let's do everything for the greater good the old girl said there's no need to pretend sacrificing a few of them to uncover my identity means nothing this is not something you need to know it's best for you to fulfill your own duties and not complicate things understand sheli and mo scoffed and replied haha you've seen right through me I'll do as you say I won't oppose in his heart he thought to himself it's worth sacrificing a few soldiers to assess her strength this is not a loss once I handle the situ situation in the southwest safe zone I'll settle the score with her at that time it will truly be beneficial at this moment the perspective shifted to Leu haa Kong he thought to himself boss jel me and mo he always pretends to be carefree but in reality he is nothing more than a monster in human guys today I made him loose face it seems that my life may be in J party later the boss loves to collect Beauties the most I must find a way to capture a few beautiful girls in the southwest safe Zone to offer them up to ensure my survival the Convoy continued to roll on for a while longer safe zone no two of you wo gradually appeared in the distance this was the area closest to the city in the southwest safe Zone Shi and mo issued the order Brothers prepare for battle he said now that I think about it we are really lucky we haven't encountered any monsters on the way but before he could finish his sentence he was startled when he saw saw ahead damn this kind of bad luck just mentioning it and it's already ineffective saying that he immediately shot a flare into the sky a loud boom echoed signaling the Convoy behind seeing this the entire Convoy became chaotic red signal this is a warning signal could it be that there's danger ahead whoa what is that in front of them was a thick mass of Monsters the scale was even greater than the Beast Tides they had seen before millions of monsters rushed wildly in the distance yigu stood High coldly observing he sneered as the host I cannot neglect to entertain our distant guests the King has specially allowed us to freely kill today the pressure that has built up for so long now is the time to release it another voice rang out hurry up our brothers have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time at that moment a soldier hurriedly ran to Exel me and mo reporting urgently the number of monsters is at least five times ours the brothers at the front line are about to collapse we have no other choice quickly Retreat Shel me and mo immediately said you are the one sent to guide us aren't you you have been too comfortable for too long lacking the mindset to change haha why say there is no choice you can always choose to seek death as he spoke he directly crushed the head of the soldier then turned to the mysterious girl haha my apologies this person Disturbed the morale of the troops before the battle I couldn't help but kill him the girl replied I don't care go do what you need to do make your move hearing the command luhua Kong began to lead the troops Don't Panic we have encountered monsters countless times out in the wilderness they are merely a pack of brainless beasts brothers let's use the old tactic crane wi formation tonight we will Feast on grilled monster immediately they formed the form the crane wind formation is an ancient formation with heavy soldiers providing protection opening up two wings like a crane spreading its feathers this is a formation that balances both offense and defense after forming the formation they quickly gain the upper hand haha indeed just a bunch of brainless beasts they can even organize themselves into a group when delivering heads we as the number one mercenary Squad in the Eastern Wilderness find it truly easy to deal with monsters he laughed loudly ha hey don't kill them all leave some for me ywu stood high above looking down and slightly curling his lips as he said it seems this time the East Region's raid is not without preparation want to play tactical formations then let's play with you Upon finishing his words he immediately transmitted orders down the monsters received the orders all those with the strongest attack capabilities quickly move to the front lines forming a spearhead formation they were commanded to launch a fierce attack on the enemy regardless of the cost a voice echoed this is the kingk order did everyone hear it clearly begin action immediately immediately seven monsters swiftly formed a strange formation this site left the mercenaries dumbfounded unable to believe their eyes what the hell is going on one soldier shouted what are these monsters trying to do another one mocked they're probably scared we'll run away so they're putting on a sh after all monsters are just a bunch of beasts their actions are entirely based on Instinct however just as the formation was completed the situation changed dramatically the monsters quickly regained the upper hand yiu silently evaluated this formation isn't of high level but it's extremely effective for commanding monsters on the opposite side Lee Wu Kong gritted his teeth in Anger damn it how can these monsters have a formation could it be they have been enlightened reflecting for a moment he immediately changed tactics don't be chaotic this low-level formation of those beasts cannot possibly be our opponents they have sacrificed their defense at the rear and flanks in order to enhance their attack capabilities we just need to encircle and kill the monsters that charge in after the change in tactics the mercenary group quickly regained their advantage indeed just as the deputy chief said those beasts may be clever but they are only capable of that much haah that's right they are just changing the way it sacrific their lives Leu Kong laughed triumphantly little monsters how amusing however yiu observed the situation and decided to change tactics you may be able to block one blade but what if it's countless blades as soon as Yu gave the order the mercenary group's formation was quickly broken apart damn it the Left Flank has several monsters breaking in the right right flank is the same a voice echoed full of panic not only that monsters are invading from all directions into our formation our formation is completely scattered seeing this scene everyone was taken a back and panicked this was the first time in their lives they had witnessed monsters with such a powerful strategy The Mysterious Girl stood up smiled and said interesting more interesting than I thought after speaking she stepped into The Fray Lee wua Kong turned to ask ask his boss boss the people from the east region have begun to take action should we offer support chel me and mo laughed hardly haha we came here to profit not to be Canon fodder tough bones should be left for them to handle the camera shifted to the mysterious girl in front of her a female figure appeared and the Monsters charged forward one of them laughed loudly haha just her not enough let's share the feast as the monsters rushed up the girl commanded kill all these beasts her subordinates immediately emerged unleashing a fierce barage of fire one shouted wait and see them get shot to bits my Beast cannons have been starving for a long time ha the monsters were utterly devastated each one swiftly eradicated a cold voice rang out the cold will make them die without feeling the pain the battle team was truly powerful just one person could take down hundreds of monsters in the blink of an eye the formation of the monsters quickly fell into disarray they began to panic and lost all fighting Spirit the bloodthirsty Red Demon boss level 180 said in fear I can't can't take it anymore if this continues they will quickly kill us we must escape quickly Escape Yi Wu transmitted his voice down his tone cold we cannot run the goal has not yet been achieved we must stand firm with our lives another voice echoed I Vis appeared looking worried Master if you give such a death command I'm afraid these monsters will be completely anihilated Yu replied his voice still calm but filled with killing intent unlike the monsters that have not yet invaded Humanity in the wonderful world the monsters of this human world take pleasure in torturing humans right now they are merely pausing their Slaughter because I am threatening them I have never accepted running away with them the bloodthirsty Red Demon desperately charge straight towards the mysterious girl shouting loudly Brothers charge with me it's just one woman with four fools right but as soon as he finished peing in the blink of an eye The Mysterious Girl appeared behind him a sweet sword strike swung out piercing through the throat of the bloodthirsty Red Demon the battle ended smoothly so quickly that no one could react the girl smiled faintly her sharp gaze looking down at his corpse so you were the boss of this rabble I accept your head seeing her strength y Wu thought to himself this woman is not simple compared to way Shu win of the Phoenix team she is much stronger how interesting she can hide in the shadows and control the monsters to act she brought the head of the bloodthirsty Red Demon in front of yiu and then said you must be the legendary y Wu right Yu was taken AB she has already discovered me for a long time it turns out she was talking to me through the head of that boss monster but how did she figure it out could it be that she has a skill or an item to control mind thinking of this you would asked how did you know that I am the one directing those monsters she smirked her gaze sharp is our east region so outdated in your eyes I'm sorry our internal strength and capabilities far exceed your imaginations even a mere Southwestern safe Zone can produce someone like you this makes me extremely interested how could you control so many monsters like that ye couldn't help but repeat her words is our Southwestern safe zone so outdated in your eyes I'm sorry our internal strength and capabilities far exceed your imaginations he gritted his teeth his eyes full of vigilance who on Earth is this woman hearing that she laughed with delight how interesting you are truly very interesting but you should not avoid it any longer don't waste our time dying early or late makes no difference to you except for how much suffering you have to endure come out so I can kill you and I can also let you serve me I want to quickly return and report my work results I really don't like the Wilderness that makes people smell of sweat Yu said I'm not in safe Zone number two if you want to kill me you will have to spend some time to find me the girl then took out a siren and directly stabbed it into the brain of the monster drawning something out is that so what a coincidence finding people is just my strong suit this side is over here you woo feel the pain emanating from his soul and immediately severed the connection with the boss monster could it be that what she extracted was yiwu's soul from deep within his soul came a strong feeling of tearing it feels just like a sliver of my soul is being forcibly separated is the siren that woman Ed some kind of special device on this side after extracting Yu's Soul she joyfully said I have Stripped Away the Consciousness and Souls of many people and their corresponding colors are extreme ugly this is the first time I've seen the Purity and beauty of Soul's color suddenly she became so excited that her power erupted outward she laughed loudly haha beautiful beautiful TR be too beautiful ye woo I must Seize Your Soul tremble let your whole body shake ye woo I absolutely will not let you escape your soul Belongs to Me Only to me I will come to find you haha seeing this scene the soldiers in the Brigade began to murmur what's wrong with this woman she just killed a monster how could she suddenly be so excited has she gone crazy another person doubted but she keeps mentioning y woo with something about a soul clearly she is confronting a boss monster where does y w come from a third person added look not only is her combat power immense but her figure is also alluring what a Pity she is a mad woman but as soon as he finished speaking the group was immediately beheaded by the girls subordinates one shouted loudly my Lord is not to be insulted by small fries like you behind her back seeing this Leu Kong angrily shouted damn it one person is unhappy and kills another do they really think our wild mercenary core the top in the East is made up of pushovers Brothers come with me but before he could finish speaking sh me and mo blocked him and reminded you truly have no Discerning Eye can't you see the true identity of that woman true identity he was startled and panicked when he heard this wait the soul taken is One's Own Boss are you talking about that woman Shi and mo sneered haha that's right she is the legendary assassin who appears like a ghost in the rumors of the east region the one whom everyone is afraid of just hearing the name her title is the soul Reaper it's said that any enemy she targets will experience the torment of having their soul stolen that kind of torture is worse than any pain in the world haha Yi Wu is about to experience that feeling Shel me and mo continued after obtaining Yu's Soul she immediately injected it into her brain ha I'm really curious a beautiful soul like that bringing such ecstasy could it surpass her previous limits as soon as she injected Yu's Soul into her head her level continually increased her power became more formidable than ever this feeling she closed her eyes SA ing it this ecstasy I've never experienced it exceeds everything I've had before with no limits whatsoever show me and mo laughed heartily haha y woo you truly did not disappoint me the crowd in the troop was shocked and shouted damn what the hell is this another person spoke up she looks like she just instantaneously leveled up and became stronger she's still talking about souls could it be that she can absorb The Souls of others to make herself stronger isn't this the female ghost a voice gently reminded everyone be quiet don't let her hear us I don't want to run into trouble because of you guys some murmured their voices tinged with excitement just a little soul could give me an extreme experience of pleasure like that so how high would your complete Soul take me she spoke as she drew a weapon then swung her sight forward creating a spatial portal without hesitation she stepped inside officially beginning her hunt why woo you are truly the first man in my life I have ever encountered who is completely worthy of me I will immediately go find you the crowd in the troop breathed the sigh of relief as she left haha she's gone damn she finally left one person trembled and spoke a woman is twisted and Powerful as that can't even be compared to a female ghost damn it she's even scarier than a female ghost another shook his head regretfully y Wu is about to suffer greatly even I can't help but start to empathize with him at Yu's side the system continuously warned the host Soul has been forcefully separated with the total amount of 1 G of human soul equivalent to 21 repairs are in progress the estimated time for completion is 8 hours during the repair all accounts and abilities are weakened by 50% this pain was even more uncomfortable than the feeling after using the shadow kingk account yuu thought to himself it seems that the background of that girl is even more complicated than I imagined I need to quickly find a safe place to survive the next eight hours however before Yi wo could run away that girl found him she stepped in front of Yi Wu smiling and said hi y woo I found you the girl's strength was indeed not to be underestimated y wo sighed this Tian is going to be a bit tricky should I just recruit her into the Herm right away the mysterious girl after confirming Yu's location immediately transmitted how is it having your soul taken away is quite wonderful isn't it Yu thought to himself she was even able to lock down my position through the mental link between me and the monster and teleported right in front of me in an instant the system immediately swapped the account to Dimension peeping Thief to find a way to escape however with the abilities being weakened everything would take a bit more time while waiting yugu tried to talk to by time he looked at the person opposite him and gave a faint smile you people in the east region actually have such an artifact which is indeed beyond my expectations the woman in front replied confidently what are you dissatisfied the inner workings of our east region are not something country bumpkins like you can compare with with your strength and knowledge it is completely normal not to know anything about the original Divine artifact yiu frowned and asked what is the original Divine AR fact she chuckled lightly and replied for your sweet soul I will tell you currently all historical records conceal important truth in the original earth besides the items that were digitized and the unexpected World destroying bosses that appeared there was also a group of special weapons and artifacts these weapons and artifacts are extraordinarily powerful and rare helping their owners survive and level up during the apocalypse and even having the ability to counter the world destroying bosses those are fortunate enough to possess them often become key figures in the subsequent world this group of weapons and artifacts is called the original Divine artifact she paused for a moment and then said this artifact is one such original Divine artifact that I exchanged all my achievements for no matter how strong you are you cannot resist the rules of the artifact yiu nodded his gaze becoming sharp so that's it I didn't expect your east region to hide such a strong card but you easily revealed this important secret to me could it be because you think I surely can't do anything she immediately brought the great fruit close to IU's face and said haha that's right these secrets are like a little compensation of mine to you your soul is incredibly beautiful it gives me a feeling of pleasure that becomes even more exhilarating to the extreme but that's still not enough not enough fundamentally it's not enough every single part of your soul from top to bottom I want it all as soon as she finished speaking she wielded her weapon and struck directly at Yu's head this situation was truly not good at all Yu thought silently it seems I still know too little about this area but when it comes to the intricacies I am absolutely not inferior to anyone just then Marilyn suddenly appeared timely blocking the attack the system has activated the valkyrie account for the host Marilyn summons 100% of Valkyrie power however due to the current weakened State the is reduced by 50% the effective remaining strategy is 50% effective duration 7 Days seeing Yu's demeanor Marilyn thought to herself what's going on Yu seems to be in an extremely weak and painful State even I am affected although that power is only half left I must use all my strength to protect him Marilyn turned her head and yelled loudly ye woo you must go I'll handle her Marilyn lunged to attack the girl and an action that only made her opponent more delighted haha ye woo you still have tricks like this interesting interesting you really can keep bringing me surprises she laughed hardly Marilyn thought to herself with my current state killing her shouldn't be difficult but under the influence of this negative state it might take a bit of time at that moment y Wu had already taken off running he thought secretly based on the current situation summoning Marilyn is the only way to fight back just then the four guards of the mysterious girls suddenly appeared surrounding Yu one of them spoke up trying to escape the prey has been marked by the Lord and has never gotten away Yu gritted his teeth thinking Dam it I forgot she has minions my judgment is slowing down how frustrating Marilyn immediately created four Shields to protect Yu from their attacks one of the guards sneered no one hunts better than us people like you can't Escape these won't protect you for long Marilyn sensed the weakening of her skills she thought this is bad my strength is also diminishing I can't hold on for long just as Marilyn was getting distracted The Mysterious Girl quickly closed in she laughed mockingly hey hey hey what are you thinking how can someone important like you afford to lose focus in the middle of a battle Marilyn was startled pushing her away get lost what have you done to me she laughed coldly replying just harvesting Souls This truly never makes me feel tired as soon as she finished speaking a wave of pain surged from deep within Marilyn's Soul causing her to scream a is this the pain that ywu is enduring a voice echoed warning warning Valkyrie has been Soul separated accountabilities weakened by 25% she looked at Marilyn's Soul with immense Delight that purple Soul radiated a strange state completely different from anything she had ever seen haa this part of the Soul brings me Indescribable Joy we're almost done here let's defeat him together today I will experience double the pleasure yes the five of them charge forward attacking Yu Marilyn quickly rushed in to Shield Yu Marilyn my time is running out Yu said his voice filled with urgency for you I care not for the future or the past I only need to protect you intact as soon as he finished speaking she Unleashed her ultimate move ultimate skill the oath of Victory Marilyn slashed a sword strike shooting straight towards the east region group leaving them unable to react ah I have taken your soul why are you still so strong ah although this is only 25% of Marilyn's power the destructive force is still incredibly Fierce a moment later as the dust settled they lay scattered on the ground having lost 85% % of their health I thought we were definitely going to die this time haha but we are still alive after using a full force move Marilyn gradually began to fade away the valkyrie account switched to a summoning side effect State the 100% value of strength began to crazily accumulate I'm sorry ye woo I still could protect you no it's not your fault thanks to you buying time I found a way to break the deadlock over here the mysterious girl used a blue magic Crystal to heal the entire team I told you the internal situation of our east region far surpasses What You country bumpkins can compare to as long as we are still alive we can immediately stand in an unbeatable position Humanity the greatest tragedy is witnessing tragedy unfold while being powerless the more the soul suffers the more pleasure I feel if you have any tricks left just go ahead and use them ye W silently thought from now on I can only gamble ones immediately after he used his devil wings to fly away the system immediately notified Soul status not fully repaired flight speed reduced by half a guard looked on and sneered with this speed you still want to escape at that moment a mocking female voice echoed don't rush let me have a little fun with him first the cat and mouse game officially began saying that she quickly followed yiu throughout the time she silently trail behind without making a move where else can you run to her voice rang out filled with delight a faint hope is more painful than complete despair you hide like this only making me crave your soul even more haha Yu silently thought you won't make a move against me great I've won the gamble if that's the case now is the time as he flew into a dense fog covered mountain range Yi wo immediately does straight into it she halted midair her face revealing clear boredom this hide and seek has been quite interesting but I'm bored now this gang should come to an end next your soul belongs to me just as she approached the mountain range sensing something unusual she landed on the ground before her was a land known as the land of mist a place where most who entered could never Escape here here is that kid he just rushed into the foggy land she said one person in the group exclaimed his face a mix of astonishment and a h of panic damn it is this luck or has even planning this from the start before them was the foggy land a place shrouded in thick Mist filled with forbidden things and Mysteries that no one understood clearly The Mysterious Girl clenched her fists her voice filled with anger Dan it I was tricked by that kiddo again one of the subordinates spoke up this is indeed the legendary foggy land it is said that when entering this place one must follow special rules otherwise they will be forcibly erased immediately moreover this arer mechanism does not distinguish between ranks is that Kido a blind cat meeting a dead mouse or did he already know this and intentionally lead us here the mysterious girl stomped her foot on the ground her eyes filled with Fury it was my oversight I should never have played the cat and mouse game from the start I let the prey slip away a precious Soul like that cannot be missed even if he runs into the foggy land I will chase after him even if I have to go to the ends of the Earth hearing her say that one of the subordinates immediately analyzed wait a minute my Lord this is definitely a trick from the very beginning I found it very strange the report states that yiu possesses two big ancient gods wuji and way shuen yet he has not used them at all and has been constantly fleeing it's absurd I fear that from the start he knew about this faulty land and intentionally let us here therefore or you must not act impulsively she was angry grabbing his collar and lifting him high are you teaching me how to do my job a simple principle like that I am not unaware of it then she threw him onto the ground and continued Yu did not intentionally refrain from using the ancient gods it is that he has no way to use them summing ancient gods although not restricted by rank has one prerequisite the soul must be intact I have extracted his soul if he carelessly summons an ancient god Emperor he will surely be backlashed as the one who holds the ancient gods he understands this very well even if he intentionally led me here I had to enter this foggy land faced with absolute strength any schemes or tricks are useless if you are afraid of death you could choose not to follow me the fierce subordinates spoke up dear leader we do not fear death but we are only concerned for your safety we are ready to live and die to protect you if you have made this decision even if it means death we will follow you it's just that our strength is not as great as yours if we do not make it this time please accept our souls so that we can be forever by your side she nodded her voice cold very well you are my subordinance and you must meet my expectations and move forward without turning back if you are prepared in spirit then come with me understood the group immediately stepped into the Misty land inside the fog was so thick that they could not see the person beside them however after walking for a while the fog gradually began to clear Before Their Eyes appear a bustling City one person exclaimed in Surprise what is this place inside the Misty land there is such a prosperous City the residents of the city began to pay attention to the group of strangers some whispered why do those people dress so strangely is it cosplay another laughed you don't understand look a woman leading four men this is urban style a rich woman enjoying the company of young men a guy teased introducing the new version of the ship that you've never seen before just wait 3 seconds and she'll be captivated by this new gameplay haha ye woo on the other side of the road shouted back are you surprised isn't a shock this foggy land is truly unexpectedly a world like this you guys are indeed Brave daring to chase after me into here seeing you woo she excitedly said you're just a lucky one prolonging your last breath a little longer do you think hiding in this foggy land can sve you your soul is still weak shattered killing you would cost me no effort at all one of the minions immediately rushed up shouting kiddo what level are you to DARE speak to my Lord like that since we've chased you into here today is your day to die just then a truck sped towards them the minion yelled damn it are you trying to die by crossing the road can't stop it now youu remain firm unshaken he raised his hand towards the truck and coldly said hemp trying to block my way I'll blow you away with just one shot suddenly he exclaimed damn it what is happening why isn't the weapon appearing at this moment he realized it was too late the truck crashed straight into him sending him flying onto the roadside seriously injured witnessing this scene the entire team was in a state of panic a mysterious girl thought to herself how can this be as a top tier team in the east region how could we be severely injured by a truck the others tried to use their abilities but all failed what is going on my weapons and items actually can't manifest not only weapons and items but also our attributes and levels have completely vanished one team member spoke up his face full of confusion YW saw this and took the initiative to speak are you only just realizing it now this is the rule of the favy land weapons items skills levels all are erased we have all returned to being Ordinary People naturally the debuff that shattered when you pulled my soul out has also disappeared y Wu continued I originally intended to escape into the foggy land using the rules and experience to compensate for the gap between us I never expected that everything could return to square one it seems the rules of the fvy land are greater than the rules of your original Divine artifact the girl fell silent for a moment and then lost her composure her voice filled with rage I have survived in a cruel apocalypse killed countless foes fought fiercely to painstakingly accumulate abilities and now everything has vanished no I absolutely cannot accept this this is unacceptable as she spoke she was screaming looking extremely distressed this caused the surrounding residents to continuously gossip what's wrong with that woman she's yelling loudly on the street she really has no qualities could she be a mental patient call the police quickly I've recently seen several news reports about mental patients attacking people don't you see that her lover just got hit by a car she doesn't seem to care she must want to cause trouble Yu calmly said don't worry losing the ability is only temporary as long as you get out of the foggy land everything will be fine however suddenly Yu's expression turned cold and a murderous Aura enveloped her the amount of suffering you caused me before I will make you suffer that much in return just then a notification board appeared in front of them Earth's countdown oh 1 minute survived for 24 hours to escape Yu thought to herself one minute before the fusion could this be the world before the Earth undergos transformation perhaps this is the time space Rift of the foggy land leading to this moment I must survive with this normal body during the initial Fusion phase for a full 24 hours all over the city every screen displayed the countdown timer but the citizens seemed oblivious to what was happening what the hell is this is this a cruel joke by a hacker no matter what happens it won't affect my salary of 3,000 a month as soon as the countdown ended a powerful time space fluctuation shook the entire Earth the real world suddenly transformed into a game a strange attribute panel appeared before everyone's eyes what the hell is this what's happening is this a three-dimensional projection no way a three-dimensional projection could not be this large in scale could it be that I'm Dreaming regardless of what it is will it affect my monthly salary of 3,000 but it didn't stop there strange objects began to appear in the sky they descended to the ground bringing with them thick clouds of dust from within the haze giant bosses with a level of 200 emerged B falling sinner Exile evil these names alone sent shivers down people's spines they were incredibly aggressive and strong causing the citizens to panic and flee oh my God what the hell is this is this the apocalypse on May 24th 2024 Earth all officially descended however the people initially thought this was just a scene from a Blockbuster movie is this being filmed the set looks so real can we really make it on to TV getting 100 youu on to be an extra is worth it some people even eagerly ran out to deliberately get in front of the camera hoping to get on screen haha this is my first time on TV I have to perform well some people took out their phones to film how are you doing you Monsters the boss monster saw that the people were not only unafraid but were also shouting provocations it immediately attacked those nearby the attacked people screamed in pain crying out in despair ah it hurts so much this isn't a special effect these monsters are all real Vehicles were struck by the waves of attacks and exploded the people some fleeing some being killed there were those who in desperation knelt down to pray mom is this all real is this the apocalypse who who will come to save us Lord please forgive us the innocent sheep grant us love Purity Freedom peace and strength to fight please save us in the midst of the chaos some people took advantage of the situation to loot stores haha finally this day has come I've been wanting to try to take free stuff for a long time brothers let's go take whatever you want if you can't get it then smash them the city was in complete chaos at this moment y woo and the Mysterious Girl Stood Still conversing with each other she smirked and said to ywo even if everyone returns to being normal our side will still have the upper hand what do you think yiu cly replied oh really she continued her gaze turning icy don't worry I won't let the dead souls in this foggy land go to waste as for you you're just an 18-year-old boy how can you possibly take on three grown men as soon as she finished speaking three of her henchmen immediately surrounded gu woo at that moment a tall muscular man rushed by carrying a large television he shouted you blind dogs don't block my way I worked hard to steal this screen if you mess it up I swear I'll kill you you turtlef face Punk Yu's mind raced that's right now that I become an ordinary person facing these strong men I will definitely be at a disadvantage in terms of strength but my advantage right now is my endurance running away might be the best option y Wu immediately turned around and ran as fast as possible an anxious subordinate shouted loudly it's not good the kid of the Lord is trying to escape the girl immediately commanded quickly chase after him just at that moment an attack from the boss struck the man then exploded right in front of them Thick Smoke billowed up creating an opportunity for ywu to escape Lord the kid has disappeared she angrily shouted damn it find him for me I must have such a delicious Soul one subordinate suggested my Lord please calm down the important thing right now is to find a way to survive these 24 hours after that dealing with the kid can wait a little later yuu Blended in with the crowd of refugees finding a safe place to hide he told himself in the past I read records about the first phase of Earth o at that time the bosses suddenly appeared dominating and destroying the Earth leaving Humanity unable to respond but then Humanity counterattacked with existing weapons indeed military aircraft launched heading straight towards the boss standing there operation sword begins all units pay attention and prepare to concentrate Firepower flying eagle read loud and clear vulture read loud and clear cond rid loud and clear however this Firepower is still not enough to harm the boss it merely needs to swing its tail to cause the planes to lose balance and crash down the attacks have completely no effect flying eagle is under attack about to crash vulture is damaged falling down cond has fallen Condor has fallen in just a moment three planes have been destroyed the Firepower is not even enough to scratch the boss at this moment people begin to rush to the shelter Mom and Dad where are you wooo look over there there's a Lost Child forget it we can barely protect ourselves right now ah hurry get into the shelter in this urgent situation the shelter is perhaps the best choice to ensure survival but for y wo following the crowd to hide underground is not the safest option according to the woman earlier the original Divine artifact is destined to descend in this era the heroes of salvation of yor were able to extend the lineage of humanity only after achieving the god Spirit right now the most important thing is not finding Refuge but figuring out how to obtain the original Divine artifact ye thought only by obtaining these God's Spirits can I smoothly surpass this 24-hour dangerous phase furthermore I might even be able to Counterattack the boss monsters if I want to detect The Descent of the god Spirits I must first reach a high place this building is just suitable for that with that thought Yi Wu ran into the building trying to climb up to the higher floors to observe after a while upon reaching the 25th floor yiu was out of breath and tired thinking the moral body is truly not easy is there still chaos outside I must find the God's Spirits before the human forces are nearly exhausted looking outside yiu saw the Army still persistently attacking the boss monster the Firepower was fierce but it seemed not to inflict any significant damage just at that moment a large Rift unexpectedly appeared in the sky from within the rift a colossal Stone tablet began to descend the surface of the stone tablet was engraved with numerous strange characters resembling the world Stone but its size was enormous combining to be as large as hundreds of buildings YW stared wondering could this be the first original Divine artifact from the stone tablet in the sky a miret of different original Divine artifacts gradually emerged glowing brightly in midair the battle seemed poised to embark on a new turning point yiu was taken aback by the scene before him and exclaimed the object objects next to the world Stone are original Divine artifacts it seems that the woman did not lie original Divine artifacts are born together with the rules and naturally possess supreme power on the other side the bosses upon seeing the world Stone fall shouted in panic We Must Destroy it immediately soon after all the bosses present concentrated all their Firepower to attack the world Stone as if it were an inveterate enemy yiu was stunned by this scene and said why do those bosses seem to suddenly go insane desperately attacking the world Stone could it have restricting or even destructive power over the bosses in an instant the world Stone was shattered by the Combined Assault of the bosses fragments flew everywhere and with it the original Divine artifacts were sent flying from the explosion Yi Wu inadvertently saw one original Divine artifact flying toward him nearby one of the original Divine artifacts fell into an alley not far from where he was Yi Wu immediately ran as fast as he could toward that direction thinking to himself I must hurry I have to obtain that original Divine artifact only then can I survive the next 24 hours on the streets it is still very chaotic a why did such a disaster happen is this world about to be destroyed oh God please save us we are all innocent y Wu quickly ran to the alley where the original Divine artifact had fallen fortunately it seemed that no one was paying attention to this area upon entering the alley yiu saw the God's spirit lying on the high wall he thought to himself what strange luck the god Spirit fell right on this high wall previously a height of more than 3 m was nothing but now I am just an ordinary teenager 18 years old level one there's no way I can easily climb up there's nothing around to step on While y Wu was still contemplating how to climb up the ground where he stood suddenly cracked open he fell into a hole no way can I be this unlucky fortunately yiu managed to grab onto a metal bar hanging precariously at the mouth of the hole this is even more Troublesome before I think of how to get the God's spirit I need to find a way to climb out of here first at that moment an arm unexpectedly reached out seemingly wanting to help vwo this person was the guy in the superhero outfit he stretched out his hand towards y wo while asking brother do you mean any help in the end he helped y Wu climb out of the pit y Wu expressed his gratitude saying thank you so much according to the information panel this person was a member of the Marvel task force named yzan noticing that Yan's level was somewhat different ye W wondered you reached level five Yen proudly replied I always feel that disaster can strike at any moment so every day I persist in doing 100 push-ups and 50 sit-ups it's all just to prepare for this day but I didn't think that helping others could also earn me experience points before you I have helped many people already taking this opportunity y w asked for another favor thank you but can I ask you to help me with one more thing I want to climb over this wall Yan immediately agreed he got into position and said all right it's a piece of cake come here brother run up a bit first then step on my hand I'll lift you up y wo quickly ran fast to gain momentum thanks to Yan's supportive hand he easily jumped up to the 3M high wall after standing firm on the wall Yi Wu turned back and expressed his gratitude thank you yan yan smiled and replied there's no need to thank me helping the people is the duty of a Marvel Agent he continued with a serious expression brother I see that you are special compared to others while they are panicking and running away you are going against the flow there must be something important going on right y Wu nodded lizen looked at him with an encouraging gaze do what you have to do I will go save more people young man let's ignite our passion even though we are just ordinary humans as long as our souls Blaze bright we can surely turn the tide take care with that said Yan quickly left to seek out more people in need of help ymu watched the figure Fade Away silently thinking what an interesting man if there were more people like you San then even if an apocalypse occurred Humanity in the real world would not find itself in such a dire situation he said now show me the true face of this original Divine artifact the original Divine artifact is the Fate dice class unknown basis based on the rolled points to satisfy the wishes of the holder the higher the points the greater the chance of fulfilling the wish the fortune value of the holder also affects the rolled points note the more difficult the wish the lower the chance of satisfaction any wish no matter how low the chance is never completely impossible cool down time ranges from 1 to 100 hours depending on the difficulty of the wish Yu was very surprised after reading the information he murmured is it really that amazing isn't this the pure rule of the god Spirit type he thought further what should my first wish be it's best not to wish for things that are too difficult like please take me out of the fogy land to meet immediately such a wish has too high a difficulty level if I fail the cool down time will extend too long making the God's spirit useless for the next 24 hours yeu considered in other words I should now make some small wishes that could save my life but are not too difficult to fulfill ywu thought for a moment and then expressed his first wish my first wish is to ensure that the group from the Easter region will not be able to obtain any original Divine artifacts within 3 hours of entering the foggy land attack is always the best form of Defense based on his luck stat yiu guessed that the number roll on the dice would be quite high he picked up the dice silently contemplating the information on the god spirit board a person with a high luck value would influence the rolled score he wondered will a high luck value help achieve a high role or will the result simply be announced after the dice come to a stop when the dice finally stopped rolling an announcement rang out congrat congratulations you have rolled the highest score 20 points your wish has been fulfilled 100% the fake dice has a cool down time of 1 hour immediately after the system checked yiwu's luck value luck value six points final score 26 the effectiveness has increased and the target will not be able to obtain God's Spirits from 3 hours to 6 hours y w cheered with joy I knew it such detailed descriptions surely aren't simple it turns out that the luck value of the holder directly adds to the road score after so much pressure luck has finally sided with me he immediately began to plan his Counterattack with 6 hours ahead of him Yu was confident that the girl's side would not be able to obtain any God Spirits he prepared to take the next step with an excited Spirit y Wu thought to himself if my luck value could be directly converted into points wouldn't I be able to use that to catch the doll after the 1-hour cooldown is over I will pray for my luck value to increase by a certain amount then after waiting for the cool down to pass I will use the fake dice to find her whereabouts once the cool down is over I will curse her to become unfortunate I can't directly pray for her to die because one such a wish might not come true two I don't want her to die easily like that Yu sneered last time she tormented me so much this time I will make her suffer just as much with a 6our Head Start I can't waste it and must take the initiative to Counterattack hitting her right in the face scene change in another place the sounds of screaming and Slaughter echoed endlessly are you all crazy the apocalypse is here and you still have the mindset to kill recklessly like this ha that's right it's just chaotic Slaughter it's just a bag of experience running around everywhere haha killing people can also earn experience points to level up another person scoffed that kid is really stupid first he thinks about running away instead of harvesting the bags of experience lying around it turned out that these were the people from the east region currently there were only three of them left and they were madly leveling up by killing countless people at that moment a god Spirit fell down not far away the subordinate spoke up Lord it seems that a god Spirit has fallen over there the mysterious girl who had just reached level six looked in that direction she immediately began to run towards the location of the god Spirit killing any enemies in her path along the way leaving no one alive she thought he probably doesn't know that after Earth was all alized even though the initial damage from the boss is significant that is still not the true Annihilation strike the real disaster occurs in 20 hours when a massive force of monsters appears by 11: p.m. the entire glow will be engulfed by nuclear bombs resulting in a large scale human death toll the next plan is clear we need to secure at least one original Divine artifact and then strive to find him after killing him we need to escape to a safe area before the nuclear bombs go out of control fortunately we belong to the east region otherwise it would be impossible to hold on to this secret information the other person laughed haha that kid surely doesn't dare to kill anyone so his level will definitely not increase running to this place is like searching for death the country F will always remain his country folks how could he possibly imagine the depth of the internal affairs of our east region one of the five Great Heroes who ended the initial alization crisis is the founder of the east region after a fierce battle the group finally reached the location where the original Divine artifact had fallen one subordinate shouted Lord look the god spirit is right there another person laughed loudly his eyes shining with greed haha it's right in front of us this God spirit will definitely belong to us they hurriedly rushed towards the ruins to fight for the god Spirit but just at that moment a bullet flew in from afar piercing through the head of one subordinate causing him to collapse on the spot the other two stood Frozen shocked by the sudden turn of events at that moment the Roar of motorcycle engines echoed loudly a convoy rushed in and those on the vehicles shouted ha what apocalypse this is basically our Paradise another one added his voice full of excitement we have adapted to this era very quickly as long as we kill our levels will rise we are so lucky we can finally do whatever we want the two people were immediately surrounded by a group of level 10 Bandits this group possessed overwhelming weapons and Firepower one subordinate stood in front of the girl shouting Lord you quickly go and seize the god Spirit leave this place to your subordinates as soon as his loyal words ended he was shot through by countless bullets collapsing right there the bandits laughed in this day and age there are still fools acting loyal whether you live or die is determined by us ha a robber approached the girl and said oh what luck these two grapefruits are round and firm the figure is so attractive and smooth just thinking about it makes my whole body ignite uncontrollably the girl thought to herself damn it this crowd is both numerous and dangerous I can't act thoughtlessly the robber continued girls if you were born with such a figure then don't hide it it's too wasteful let us take a good look at it as soon as he finished speaking he lunged forward and ripped the girl's shirt apart another one walked by and snatched her mask laughing haha Brothers don't hold back do whatever you want today is truly a jackpot seeing such beauty makes me even more excited this opportunity cannot be wasted we must enjoy it to the fullest today the girl struggled but in front of the large and menacing crowd she couldn't resist the situation was more dangerous than ever seeing the original Divine artifact still lying amidst the ruins she gritted her teeth and endured silently thinking endure I must definitely endure once these people have vented their frustrations I will seize the opportunity to take the God's spirit at that time I will make them wish they were dead even their souls will be tortured thinking this she changed her tone becoming exceptionally alluring all right everyone if you want to be more stimulated then let's go all away a group activity is fine I will definitely satisfy you like never before ensuring that you won't forget hearing this one of them laughed and said impressive I didn't expect this girl to be so depraved ha that's right another chimed in Brothers Let's choose our positions and see what her her skills are at that moment a very familiar hand reached out quickly grabbing the original Divine artifact it was no one else but ywu who had now reached level 15 after obtaining the second God Spirit Yu said everyone is really Lively well very good this God's spirit belongs to me I won't disturb the places of work the mysterious girl from the east region upon seeing y wo acquire the god Spirit was so Furious that blood rushed to her head everyone wondered will Yu save her or will he take action only after letting her be humiliated when the gangsters saw yo they immediately fired a shot at him one shouted loudly where did this kid come from daring to ruin our fun damn it I hate the most those pretentious guys y Wu only used two fingers to catch the bullet then he casually said if you want to pretend you need to have real strength as for you you're just not smart enough the bandits were in a state of panic when they saw that Yu's level was 15 they were astonished exclaiming how how can this be we clearly kill people quickly and in large numbers why doesn't our leveling up match yours yiu calmly replied there's a proverb that goes the horse is a foot tall but the way is a yard High it seems that saving people earns more experience points than killing the attitude of the bandits changed immediately one of them laughed loudly haha what did you say you look familiar to me and now I realize you ruthlessly teach me how to be human it's just like a brother from the same father but a different mother look here it really is the great flood overflows the dragon King's Temple and people of one family don't recognize each other come on Brothers we must share this good thing together another one chimed in don't be fooled by This Woman's Fierce appearance she is actually very gentle exactly exactly Yu coldly said You all take your time to enjoy I have other business and will not participate saying that ye W turn to leave at this moment the girl burst into tears sobbing I'd rather die wait I know you must want to kill me then kill me now she thought to herself all my patience and all the humiliation I have endured are no longer meaningful y Wu calmly said I remember you once said that fragile hopes often cause more pain than complete despair so turns out you were speaking to yourself but it's not just that I want you to feel even more suffering than that I will not only spare your life but I also want to ensure you survive to leave this land of fog after saying that Yu threw the dice of fate and then declared his wish I wish for you to continue living the result showed the number 15 and the wish was granted the system announced the target can live but Integrity is not guaranteed yumu turned to the girl and coldly said I can assure you of one one thing wanting to live is impossible wanting to die is equally feudal the girl screamed in pain why why can't you let me die in peace you scum I swear even if I become a ghost I will not spare you her screams gradually faded mingling with sounds of Despair she mumbled you you are not enough yet don't don't come anymore ywu silently turned and walked away leaving everything behind including the girls sorrow and hatred somewhere else the military was still actively fighting against the boss Yu took out the second primordial God Spirit to check the information the W seeing Magic Pen has the ability to materialize items drawn based on the will of the holder the level of the item will depend on the accuracy and Aesthetics of the drawing the more Exquisite the painting the higher the rank and the stronger the effect finally yiwu also achieved the second primordial God Spirit yiu thought to himself I know everything but I completely do not know how to paint well let's just give it a try saying that he drew a sword but the result was not as he expected the sword looked ugly with the stats accuracy level E Aesthetics level F component level E the final evaluation showed that the effect was only at level one with no special effect yiu looked at the sword and wanted to fall into depression this is probably only good for peeling oranges he complained in the end Yu decided to set this aside and prioritize ensuring his own safety first he planned to gather a large amount of world Stone fragments if ol represents destruction then the world stone is undoubtedly the symbol of rebirth this is also an opportunity to prevent disaster from the very beginning ywu murmured as long as we can protect the world Stone we can maintain hope it's just that in the early stages of O all the fighting value of humanity is is truly too low unable to stop the boss from destroying the world Stone while thinking Yi Wu suddenly noticed a boy doing something below 1 2 3 4 five still missing still missing a lot the boy mumbled seeing this y Wu approached and asked what are you doing it's very dangerous here the boy looked up and calmly replied today I was at kindergarten aha right here he continued but then suddenly there was an earth quake and collapse except for me the teacher and the other little friends everyone else has died I'm afraid their families won't find them so I'm making tombstones for each one if their families come they will know where to look hearing the boy speak y wo felt a shiver a small child like this can remain calm in the face of such a great tragedy perhaps the disaster came too suddenly no one could react in time this is indeed the beginning of the Apocalypse thinking that you was softened his tone and advised little buddy quickly leave here find a safe place to hide when you grow up you will have the strength to rebuild here the boy continued to draw on the stone tombs with the chalk in his hand then responded I can't grow up here I know I will be like everyone else I won't live long but Everyone likes the drawings I make I also really enjoy drawing as long as I draw well adults will surely recognize us and take all Little Friends home at this moment you W took a closer look at the images the boy had drawn they were so vivid and realistic that it was hard to believe he thought to himself this is just a Kindergarten kid the W seeing Magic Pen in my hand has probably found the right place to exert its effect seeing the boy looking sad Yi Wu gently patted his head to comfort him it's okay you've done very well these crisis will pass and you will definitely grow up the boy felt a little more cheerful upon hearing this yiu continued to ask you seem to be very good ARA the boy proudly patted his chest and said hemp don't be fooled by my age I've received many awards already everyone says I'm a painting genius but all of that is meaningless drawing beautifully doesn't help anyone it can't bring them back to life hearing this Yi Wu handed the boy the W seeing Magic Pen and said this might not be the case take this pen and try to draw the best machine gun you can imagine having played free fire and and climbed up to the legendary rank drawing a gun was too simple for him in just a moment he completed the drawing of the thunder gun is this good enough brother the system provided an evaluation for the Thunder submachine gun accuracy ah Esthetics B+ components B+ and C+ final evaluation level 100 special effects infinite ammunition infinite firing rate capable of attacking both long range and close combat seeing the Thunder submachine gun was so impressive that Yu felt so delighted he wanted to jump up he never expected to own a weapon of level 100 with this gun surviving for 24 hours was no longer a significant concern y wo turned to the boy and said little buddy it's so beautifully drawn help me draw a few more items will you hearing that the boy broke out in a sweat brother you're exploiting child labor here that being said his passion for drawing remained extremely strong in less than an hour the boy gifted ywu three more highlevel equipment a level 90 machine gun turret a level 88 energy shield and a level 80 handgun however the Magic Pen can only create a maximum of five items per hour this time it has reached its limit and entered cooldown but that was already fantastic you patted the boy's head smiling and saying all right that's enough thank you little buddy ye wo silently thought with these equipment I can say I have both offense and defense covered surviving 24 hours should definitely not be a problem however these weapons have not been tested yet I don't know how powerful they really are at that moment a group of Bandits riding large motorcycles rushed in like the wind quickly surrounding yiu and the boy looking over yiu recognized them as the ones who have participated in the collective attack on the mysterious girl in the east region but this time they had reached level 25 as they circled around the shaved-head blonde laughed loudly haha kid you made us waste our time searching for you finally we've met again yiu saw their levels and was slightly surprised I didn't expect you guys to reach level 25 so quickly the shaved headed guy proudly boasted who said we had good luck while randomly breaking in we found an underground shelter we went in there and killed to our heart's content not too many only about a thousand people he laughed maliciously continuing of course we didn't just kill people before taking action we also went easy on those women haha but your luck isn't as good as ours Kid last time you embarrassed us now I'll shoot you into a mat haha don't blame us we are just survivalists in reality to survive we stop at nothing anyone who makes us uncomfortable Must Die saying this they iMed immediately opened fire continuously toward ywu Yu quickly Drew out the energy Shield blocking all the bullets this scene left the robbers stunned one of them shouted how can this be all the bullets are blocked y woo chuckled lightly thinking of himself it seems my luck hasn't run out yet I decided to Counterattack and test the weapons I just crafted bullets fall like raindrops all beings stand still before the six barrels all lives are equal Yu murmured then pulled the trigger the rain of bullets from Yi Wu's gun turned the robbers into a meat pile the gunfire ceased the atmosphere became silent leaving only the corpses of the unfortunate along with a flood of experience points adding up for ywu he smiled with delight thank you for stopping by to give me a bag of experience I'm so lucky to have met this little friend youu looked at the boy his expression thoughtful he continued it seems like I saved you but in reality you are the one who saved me saying that ywu took a handgun from his backpack and handed it to the boy he gently said this gun I give to you consider it as a thank you then y Wu took out the Fateful dice he closed his eyes and prayed I pray for this boy to survive safely in This Disaster even though this wish has a very high chance of failing I still have to try if I fail I'll find another way after saying this yiu grasped the dice tightly in his hand his eyes gradually becoming Resolute notification system congratulations you have rolled the highest scored 20 Desir to achieve 100% the dice of Fate coold down time 1 hour plus the Lux stat of the holder is six final score 26 additional effect the target will also survive the next Crisis Yu was quite surprised by the result he thought to himself rolling the biggest score again is this my luck or is it the boy's luck has my Action Sound the seeds of Fate after ensuring the boy was safe y Wu turned to say goodbye don't worry everything will be fine next you will also be safe now I have to leave having said that Yi Wu turned to walk away but just a moment later he looked back and saw the boy quietly following him he was a bit puzzled why are you still following me if you keep doing so it will only make you more dangerous the boy placed his hands on his hips replied seriously boss don't trick me even though I find you very strange the only way I feel safe is to follow you moreover didn't you say I will be safe next if I follow you from a certain perspective wouldn't you be safer too yeigh inwardly thinking facing the disaster while fighting against the bandits at the kindergarten now hearing these words he wondered is this boy really just an ordinary child or is he someone who has time travel no never mind if he wants to follow let him follow after all he won't be able to accompany me for long within 24 hours I will leave here thinking so Yi Wu continued his journey with the boy to search for the fragments of the world Stone after several hours they finally found the first fragment Yu stared intently at the fragment thinking the writing on this fragment is completely incomprehensible but I am sure the information on it is very important and this huge piece how am I supposed to carry it just then an announcement from the Misty land rang out only 10 hours remain before the ol love disaster occurs without hesitation y Wu continued his journey in the misty land when he touched the world Stone he instantly leveled up to 17 this surprised y Wu as he had Advanced two levels in one go it turned out that collecting fragments of the world Stone could bring about a significant amount of experience points moreover the account system which had previously limited leveling up due to the rules of the Misty land had been completely lifted Yu's Journey continued with new challenges ahead not only y wo the boy had also leveled up to level five very excited he said boss we are shining seeing this Yi Wu thought to himself this kid has also continuously leveled up it seems this definitely relates to me he then said kid you shouldn't keep following me the road ahead will become increasingly dangerous hurry back home your parents must be very worried about you when he mentioned his parents the boy's face suddenly darkened looking sad with a trembling voice he said my home has long ceased to exist my parents divorced I live with my dad but he has never cared about me in fact he doesn't see me as his son isn't that a family it's just a broken house without any kinship I don't want to go back there boss please let me follow you he raised his head his gaze Resolute even though I don't know you well and you are very strange I know you are very strong I want to become strong with you Yu thought to himself I once read in a book that before the apocalypse the divorce rate was astonishingly high in contrast after the apocalypse occurred the divorce rate dropped sharply looking at the determination and spirit of the boy Yi Wu finally agreed to let him accompany him he said all right but you need to prepare yourself mentally whates next will not be a joke we have to collect the large black Stones while fighting monsters to help others this is how we level up if you slow me down I won't hesitate to leave you behind the kid confidently replied hemp don't worry I absolutely won't hold you back so the two siblings journeyed together battling and leveling up after 2 hours y Wu had reached level 20 and the boy had reached level 12 Boss look we found another large Stone 3 hours passed and they coordinated smoothly defeating monsters and rescuing people Yu leveled up to 35 while the boy reached level 16 their leveling speed was astonishing 17 hours had passed since Earth all began the two siblings found fragments of the world Stone and Yi Wu reached level 40 the boy could hardly contain his excitement boss thank you thank you so much when 20 hours had passed since the Earth was corrupted Yu had reached level 50 and the boy had reached level 20 the boy eagerly said boss this is just like playing a game now I can defeat those monsters with my bare hands but just then Yu recall the words of the mysterious girl from the east region who had said the 20 hours are just the beginning the coming time will truly be the destruction of humanity tens of thousands of monsters poured Down to Earth from the teleportation Gates Humanity's current weapon were completely powerless against the highlevel monsters the Supreme leaders of humanity began to consider the final option using nuclear weapons however a bigger problem arose not only could humans level up but the monsters were also gradually evolving the low-level swamp monsters had now become a nightmare as they successively transformed heat up a voice echoed from the level 20 female Hawk monster haha kill all these reptiles these non-flying ones are nothing The Savage laugh after resounded the situation was becoming increasingly chaotic monsters seemed to pour in endlessly killing without rest bite the level 30 highly toxic Fish Man appeared further plunging Humanity into despair yiu thought to himself we level up and the apocalypse is leveling up too this time I encountered a level 50 hunting sold deer and a level 70 Jackal Warrior accompanied by a boy y Wu fired continuously at them but it seemed that all efforts were in vain the monsters were unfazed growing more ferocious over time just then a boss appeared the level 120 blood Spider Queen looked at Yu coldly laughing where you think you're going why not stay here and become my food this time seems off y woo and the boy have been completely surrounded by the monsters the boy on the other hand shows no signs of panic he directly Fires at the blood Spider Queen but the bullet is not even enough to harm her boss our weapons are ineffective at that moment the cooldown of the wanking Magic Pen has ended y Wu immediately hands it to the boy and says next it's up to you the coold down of the god Spirit has finished use all your imagination to draw an item capable of dealing with these monsters I will hold them off the boy takes the Divine pen and immediately focuses intensely to create a new weapon meanwhile yiu strives to defend and buy time however the old gold weapons are too lowlevel and are easily destroyed by the boss the blood Spider Queen scoffs foolish kid stop wasting your efforts on feudal struggles I will cook you a simple and delicious meal as soon as she finishes speaking she launches an attack directly at Yu's head in the moment of life and death the boy completes his drawing of a weapon the newly created weapon generates a shield blocking the blood spider Queen's attack surprising her greatly what is this not only that the weapon that the boy just created also has the ability to generate Phantoms of tens of thousands of different swords blades and Spears under his control countless weapons shot straight toward the monsters annihilating them entirely leaving not a single piece of armor behind seeing that terrifying scene yiu opened his eyes wide astonished beyond words the boy proudly exclaimed I drew the props in the game have you ever played it before I didn't expect to draw a level 200 PR he even winked smiling brightly boss I'm not hindering you am I yiu thought to himself this boy's Talent is truly against the heavens I've really stumbled upon a treasure while yiu was still amazed at the boy's abilities the unexpected happened the highest leaders of humanity decided to use nuclear bombs to eliminate all monsters a massive mushroom cloud erupted marking a historically destructive moment yigu contemplated this is what ancient texts call the strongest finishing move of humanity nuclear weapons could it be that Humanity has decided to adopt a strategy where both sides suffer this time humanity Unleashed countless nuclear bombs on the cities occupied by monsters witnessing that terrifying power yiu could not contain himself exclaiming in panic is this the ultimate finishing move of ancient Humanity architecture and monsters evaporated in an instant everything truly exuded the aura of annihilation Yu stood there his eyes clearly showing surprise The Shield that the boy created truly astonished him the shield was not only powerful but could also withstand the shock waves from a nuclear explosion he thought to himself this boy is indeed a genius if nurtured he will definitely achieve great things in the future but then a wave of anxiety began to fill Yu's mind he wondered even if we escape this explosion what about the radi ration afterwards will the radiation automatically dissipate once we leave the fog covered area while he was deep in thought Yu suddenly faced another situation a girl from the East appeared her eyes filled with rage as soon as she saw him she shouted you dare to make me endure unprecedented humiliation and suffering you are truly despicable in her hand was a holy sword looking incredibly domineering it was a god Spirit of the Sea of time level wielding terrifying power power this sword not only contained endless Primal energy but also emitted sword aura that surrounded her entire body forming a strong defensive barrier its defensive effect reduced 80% of all damage for 30 minutes as for the sword's attacking ability it could break through time space and even the rules its power was determined based on the level of rules it countered Yu looked at the holy sword in the girl's hand thinking to himself I never expected that sheepa possessed such a terrifying weapon the girl joyfully shouted I risked my life searching for the God's spirit and finally found it before the nuclear explosion moreover this God spirit is stronger than all the primordial God Spirits collected in the east region all the hardships I endured are worth it what you've done now holds no meaning no matter what happens next you will die haha yiu was quite surprised by this girl's Fierce Spirit he silently thought this woman is indeed resilient clearly tortured to the brink of death yet she was still able to find the god Spirit but thinking back my earlier decision to pray for her to not obtain the God's spirit for a period of time was completely correct with her tenacity if I had directly prayed for her to die in this foggy land that wish likely wouldn't have come true because it would have been too difficult to accomplish she swam her holy sword directly at the protective barrier of yiwu and the boy causing the support value to drop to just 20% this is not good the God's spirit in her hands is too powerful y wo exclaimed The Shield that can withstand nuclear attacks can endure two strikes from her sword seeing the critical situation the boy quickly began to draw a holy sword that resembled the girl's sword from the east region y Wu held the fake holy sword in his hand facing the girl from the east region she looked at him with a gaze full of disdain her voice cold the primordial God Spirit has no rank it power is merely based on attributes and what you have in your hand is just a piece of trash a fake item all attributes reduced by half yiu pursed his lips trying to evade the space ripping sword strikes from her while searching for an opportunity to Counterattack seeing this the girl from the east region sneered just like you trash will forever remain trash you a country bumpkin from the southwest region what do you rely on to fight against the deep-seated roots of the east region she curled her lips her tone even more mocking whether it's you or the God's spirit in your hand everything is too weak the soall weakness is a type of crime what you do is merely prolonging the inevitable for a bit but how long do you think you can last ha ye who listen to every word of ridicule but did not let them shake his resolve he looked at her his eyes flashing with determination even with a fake sword he would find a way to turn it into an advantage if I cannot be strong right now I will fight smarter Yu silently vowed tightening his grip on the hilt of the sword yiu said no need for a long time just the present is enough just as her sword strikes were about to reach yiu the fog land issued a notification 24 hours ended prepare to return at the same time two beams of light from the teleportation array shot straight to their location you looked at the girl and smiled teasingly it seems that the power of the rules of the fogland is still greater than the god spirit in your hands the girl gritted her teeth thinking danant just a little bit more clearly he was about to die but why did the time in the fog Land End right at this moment what are you so smug about even if I can't kill you here as long as I have this God spirit I can torture you every second every minute outside as soon as she finished speaking the fog land announced again except for the fragments of the world Stone nothing else can be brought out turn immediately hearing that the girl trembled with anger thinking why based on what why is it like this on this side YW heard the announcement through the god Spirit of faithful dice to the boy and said this God Spirit you take it it should help you from now on you have to rely on yourself y woo thank you I will never forget your kindness the boy said that's right my name is muu don't worry I will definitely try try to become strong and survive hearing this name Yi Wu fell into deep thought muu this name sounds familiar suddenly he was startled his eyes filled with astonishment wait I remember now muu isn't he the leader of the five Great heroes in Legend this kid is grown to such an extent it's hard to believe who knows how ye W will deal with the girl from the east region after returning the two had now exited the Misty land immediately the m serious girl with the god Spirit rushed straight at y wo to attack while attacking she laughed coldly even if I can't get the Primal God Spirit In The Misty land I still have this God spirit and you you have nothing in your hands how do you think you can fight against me I will slowly drain your soul and torture you bit by bit Yu remained calm chuckling lightly hey what are you daydreaming about thinking on that weak his agility was incredible he easily dodged her attack and seized the opportunity to grip her wrist tightly the girl panicked not anticipating that this surge of strength would far exceed her expectations Yu smirked lightly and said your previous Advantage was merely based on the information Gap I have paid a steep price for my ignorance but that is where it ends after 24 hours in the land of mist the tricks you used against me have completely vanished the woman remained arrogant shaming in Yu's face so what you just a country bump from the southwest compared to the inner workings of our east region you were nothing at all you were like a pile of garbage buried underground both useless and wasteful I have countless ways to kill you even so she still did not understand the issue yiu side deciding to take a moment to explain things to her he snapped his fingers and laughed coldly oh really fine since you want to talk about inner workings then open your eyes wide and see what true inner workings are like the woman was taken AB stepping back a few Paces screaming what what you plan to do Yu did not answer he simply summoned four ancient gods not to fight but just to let her take a look the four names appeared thousand eyed demon laus origin of nature return to oness disaster plague jubo and Chaos lawn Radia system notification successfully summoned four ancient gods duration 30 seconds seeing the Magnificent scene before her she began to tremble filled with fear and exclaimed four ancient gods how is this possible the ancient gods are the biggest trump card of the east region yet you possess all four at once this is terrifying to a degree I can't even fathom immediately she knelt down her mind completely in chaos fear regret unwillingness but also full of worship and negativity those emotions surged like a storm the leader of the east region sent me to deal with you what kind of monster are you I even dared to hold on to hope for victory against a being like this ye who Ste forward seiz the God's spirit from her hands and said coldly you've been overwhelmed by negative emotions and your spirit is in disarray just from a glance but that's still not enough in the land of mist your life is spared for this moment you love to Soul drain others so you should also feel a bit of the pain of having your soul Stripped Away under the influence of her own God's spirit her soul was pulled away bit by bit by ywu she began to go insane laughing and yelling haha keep draining my soul like this dying like this has no regrets system notification the target has had 20 gr of Soul extracted leaving one gr ye wo coldly said die no no no it's not that simple I will make you live in this pain for the rest of your life oh it's indeed away looked down on the male lead but this ending is too tragic the scene shifts to Safe area number two a lowly subordinate reported boss as expected the people in the Eastern team are indeed foolish they easily volunteered to be our guns to puru yiu Vice Captain of the poison dragon mercenary Li huok Kong sneered that woman's team is really impressive but it has been 24 hours and they haven't returned it seems y wo is not easy to deal with show me and mo replied haha who cares about them this only proves that leaving those women behind was the right decision While y wo is not here let's go steal some homes the subordinates immediately flattered haha boss plans like a god totally top-notch suddenly the driver pointed outside and said in panic ha why are there suddenly so many likes in the city perhaps they see us coming no they can't resist so they might be preparing to self-destruct just as he had not even had time to Rejoice the Convoy was attacked by countless missiles damn it it's us they want to blow up one of the men in the Convoy shouted Li wua Kong quickly activated the defense shield and ordered hurry up quickly deploy the energy shield for defense one of his subordinates panicking exclaimed half of our Convoy has already been blown to Pieces Li wua Kong remained unfazed and immediately commanded you kids pull the missiles off the vehicles and fire back at them in an instant countless missiles were launched toward the city wall but before they could reach their target they were shot down by the fortress's anti-aircraft system leaving nothing behind his subordinates exclaimed in fear damn it our missiles have been shot down by the High Caliber artillery on the city wall shomi and mo calmly said what are you panicking for I'm not unprepared everything is within my expectations after saying that he took out a huge cannon the super laser Siege Cannon he proudly remarked haha this is the treasure I bet my entire Fortune to buy just for this Siege the super cannon immediately fired creating an incredibly powerful energy laser shooting straight into the fortress's defenses the drones quickly soared into the sky forming multiple layers of energy shields for defense upon seeing the shield activated one of the members shouted boss they seem to have support behind them the layers of energy shields were erected densely but they couldn't stop the attacking laser beams the laser beams shattered the Shields and pierced straight into the walls sheli and mo watched this scene laughing joyfully ha useless this big guy of ours is both large and Powerful no matter how many layers it will penetrate all prepare everyone after breaching the city will Loop money land and even women for me haha the laser strike flew directly towards the city wall expecting a massive explosion unexpectedly the wall showed not a single scratch seeing this XEL me and mo was horrified thinking to himself what the hell is this after breaking all the energy Shields the laser of the treasure lost its Effectiveness but the cooldown time for this weapon was up to 5 hours sheli and mo exclaimed damn it what should we do now then he immediately ordered withdraw quickly withdraw as long as as we keep the Green Mountains we won't fear lack of firewood wait for the treasure to cool down and we will come back as soon as they had run a few meters y wo blocked their path one of them yelled boss it seems like there's someone in front sh me and mo immediately replied it doesn't matter if he's a human or a ghost with this Firepower do we really have to fear just one of him just shoot into pieces and Retreat quickly yiu snapped his fingers a faint smile spreading across his face I came here personally to entertain you don't rush to leave immediately Yu summoned his Mount ready to let them see what true power really is the mercenaries behind had no choice but to concentrate their fire and shoot wildly at Yu quick Focus fired to take him down we can't let him Counterattack yigu smirked if you want to leave then let me escort you for a bit he immediately exhaled Frost freezing and inhaling all the mercenaries in the east region the mercenary Squad was completely wiped out the system announcement the host has earned 10 million experience points 8 million currency received item super laser cannon a fortification braking weapon with extremely high power cool down time 5 hours in addition Yi Wu also received the promotion guide for the mercenary Vice Captain a detailed document on Fast promotion methods helping one gain favor with superiors while controlling subordinates how interesting interesting ye Wu smir murmuring the heart points to the compass just imagine what you are searching for in your mind it will guide you to your destination the more complete your imagination is the easier it is to receive accurate Guidance the mercenary cor rolls around in the wilderness all year round relying on this tool to track down the traces of enemies and the direction of various wild beasts there was a strange prop mixed into this round's rewards one person scoffed last time it was the secret of reading now it's the secret of sing truly helpless at this moment Yi Wu looked up at the sky and discovered a strange ray of light he thought to himself is that the satellite from the east region truly a Troublesome existence I'll keep an eye on it for now next it will be their turn he decided this time I will go directly to the east region to make my mark in the east region inside the satellite monitoring room the staff was working anxiously a supervisor reported in Panic Chief the surveillance satellite is transmitting images all members of the team and the mercenaries we dispatched have been eliminated moreover it was all at the hands of a teenager named guwu hearing this Victor slammed his hand on the table in Anger shouting waste waste a bunch of wastes even such a small matter can't be handled I have managed the field of science and technology in the east region for years and have never endured such humiliation y woo we we are not done with each other he thought to himself initially dealing with the Southwest area was the main objective but from now on I will prioritize eliminating ywo soon after he ordered his subordinates you all continue to monitor the movements of the Southwest area I will discuss the next actions with the higher-ups understood a short while later at the high level meeting of the east region everyone voted on the resolution to continue pursuing Yu the result was four absten one approval and this resolution was not passed seeing this Victor tried to persuade them you all those country bumpkins in the southwest area are relying solely on yiu to dare to sever ties with us in the East if we don't eliminate this person he will definitely become a major disaster in the future someone on the screen retorted with the internal situation of the east region are we really afraid of just y wo that's right don't waste so many resources solely on y anymore we should make some adjustments to our strategy against him another person interrupted all right no more butts Victor you have failed in this Mission you have wasted the resources of the east region so prepare to face the consequences with that the other four turned off their screens Victor was angry thinking to himself these stupid uncultured fools fundamentally do not realize that ywu has become a threat to us if we let him fully grow we will have to pay the price even if the other highclass groups in the east region let you go ywo I will definitely not spare you if you dare to appear I will surely Crush you the scene shifts to the hanger at safe Zone number two at this moment Nana was still focused on repairing the spacecraft master master come quickly to see the progress of repairing and upgrading the spacecraft is already 90% complete amazing hearing this yiu walked over patted Nana's head and praise Nana is truly amazing Nana was both happy and thought to herself you stinky yo always breaking the rules just keeps patting my head but considering your honesty I won't hold it against you Yu then pondered before I used a count power but still couldn't fly out this proves that the products post all cannot surpass the confinement limits of the universe he then turned to Nana and asked what is the current propulsion energy source of the spacecraft Nana replied the initial driving energy source is almost depleted so I've upgraded it into a high energy explosion magic Crystal she seemed very proud of her invention in her heart she urged herself come on Yu don't hold back anymore hurry up and praise me however Yu felt uneasy this high energy explosion magic Crystal after the old world has indeed been widely used to provide mechanical energy however this product is from the old period and certainly not suitable if not the technological advancements of the east region would have soared to the skies and they wouldn't need to restore Technologies from before the old period nevertheless yugu admitted that he understood too little about the period before all he thought it's better to ask the principal as he thought this he turned and left without saying a word Nana was Furious thinking yiu is so annoying why did he leave like that where's the pra for me where's the admiration he has for me hemp if he wants to go then go I don't need him to compliment me anyway the next day at Yu's old University a crowd of students was buzzing hurry up look isn't that the legendary figure of our Academy that's right it's him why is he back here I wonder if this time there's a chance to ask for a senior's autograph the principal gathered everyone today to welcome y woo it feels like this is a rare opportunity to meet a super Superstar when the principal solemnly announced everyone please welcome the legend of our Academy the pride of the Southwest safe Zone y woo welcome back to your old school y wo senior the atmosphere around became Lively people stood together Whispering I want to get a little closer to see YW Senor he be careful not to fall another excited student squeezed into the crowd senior can you sign for me or say something to encourage us would be great a new student full of excitement shouted senior I am a new student I admire you so much just hearing legends about you is astonishing and today I finally get to meet you in person Yu was surrounded by students to the point that he had to turn to the principal and asked principal what's going on the principal laughed hardly ha I intentionally arranged this for you you were the pride our Academy deserving of such treatment but you we seemed overwhelmed by everyone's enthus iasm he forced a smile and quietly said to the principal principal we should find a quiet place to discuss business a little while later in the principal's office he asked so the reason you came to see me this time is what youde with galif theying give himself finally I escape the crowd everyone is just too enthusiastic the principal hearing this immediately questioned fossil fuels what are you doing with such an inefficient energy source currently the use of magic crystals to manufacture energy cells has far surpassed the efficiency of fossil fuels Yi Wu calmly replied I have a specific purpose in short if you know anything please tell me the principal stroked his beard deep in thought this matter is indeed not simple for hundreds of years now people have stopped using fossil fuels so no detailed information about it has been preserved even on the MU way map there are no relevant markings however based on my knowledge around the the ancient ruins that few people visit there may still be some remnants of fossil fuels this is the quickest and simplest method but if your demand is greater you will need to seek out the reserves deep underground this will definitely take much more time yiwu thought to himself so my next plan will be to search for fossil fuels after a moment of contemplation he asked further principal do you have any information about muu one of the five Great Heroes the principal immediately said muu is indeed a hero who resonates with Heroes a new Talent like you has begun to pay attention to the legends of ancient Heroes he stands at the top of the five Great Heroes a superpower strategist and has never suffered defeat in his life this ability is said to stem from two miraculous artifacts he possesses yiu was taken aback when he heard the principal mention the two God Spirits two miraculous artifacts previously in the misty land I had given muu two primordial God spirits and he truly inherited them could this affect the current timeline it seems that the time Rift in the misty land is completely different from the dungeon it can connect with real time and space I have changed the timeline without realizing it which is somewhat Troublesome matters related to the timeline are always very headache inducing the principal continued I suddenly remembered something mu seemed to have told me before that muu is his ancestor and moreover mu also said that his ancestor did not die and it's still alive at that time I thought mu way was just joking and since it was a joke that lasted for 2 days I didn't pay much attention I wonder if this is useful information for you hearing this Yi Wu felt extremely shocked mu youu and mu way are blood relatives moreover they are still alive but with such a Time Gap how could he live that long this completely surpasses the lifespan of a human what on Earth has happened ye Wu pondered if muyu meets again and recognizes me what will happen at this moment in safe zone no two in the southwest YW have begun to implement the plan to search for fossil fuel energy everything was prepared finally he could set off before the O process took place however the principal's words still echoed in Yu's mind ywu fossil fuel may not be enough to meet your goals I advise you to consider using nuclear energy however before o Humanity only holds a small part of nuclear energy anti-gravitational fuel hearing this yiwu in himself nuclear energy the principle makes sense but nuclear materials are much rarer than fossil fuels for now to save time I might prioritize searching for fossil fuel first at that moment y Yan's younger sister an kayak just arrived yanf said wow you made this airplane really big are you preparing to go far from home again kayi who just reached level 100 excitedly boasted to Y wo we have always listened to you continuously training ourselves now I have become really strong you can feel it right XA Chen who reached level 260 laughed while drinking and said not bad it's only been a short time since we last met and you've gotten stronger but during this time I've been eating at your place and I've been a bit laxed in leveling up Yu chuckled haha Sulu has also reached level 220 now Yin Juan at level 170 Juan how at level 185 and ji Wang Chuan at level 200 also just arrived Yin ruen said V woo we just cleared the dungeon and you called us all here is there a new plan seeing Kai XI hugging y woo Yin Moon felt a bit jealous and teased leave the job of protecting Yu to me our team is much more professional Kai XI replied in panic ah I'm not saying I have to protect y wo with his strength it's not up to me to protect him right Juan how hugged y Wu's shoulder and laughed loudly you truly are impressive I've heard you tamed all the monsters during our time clearing this dungeon what great things have you accomplished he continued when we came out of the dungeon we saw the monsters help helping the residents repair and build houses on our way back it was such an unbelievable scene so harmonious that I thought I was dreaming ji Wang Chun looked surprised and turned to Y Wu vwoo The Monsters all say you are their King what exactly is going on he hesitated I don't mean to doubt you I just want to understand the situation after all Tam me all the monsters is really hard to imagine I hope you can understand that Yu replied cly yes I understand however I will explain it more clearly when I have the opportunity for now I will tell you about what has happened recently and what is about to come a moment later yiu recounted the entire story to everyone they exclaimed what are you talking about during the time we were grinding in the dungeon so many Earth shattering events occurred did you really single-handedly eliminate the notorious east region team number four I thought that after leveling up from the dungeon I could match up with them but now it seems there's no longer any chance moreover is the primordial God Spirit you mentioned really so powerful that it left you in awe but why have we never heard of such a thing until now shoen stood behind silently thinking the primordial God Spirit huh that old man New Way didn't mention it to me before but at that time I thought it was just a fictional story not paying much attention I didn't expect it to be real then sh Chen looked up at the sky and said are you saying that the bright spot in the sky is the satellite of the east region I didn't expect them to have made it this far so now that we are gathered here aren't we clearly visible to them kaiak XI spoke up if that's the case we should find a more secretive Place Juan how quite combative loudly said what's there to be afraid of if they want to watch let them watch no need to be scared we can just go all out Sho Chen calmly replied if that's the case I also suggest we change locations before discussing further according to Yin Juan she completely trusts ywu she said if you are aware of the existence of the surveillance satellites in the east region y Wu must have already taken effective shielding measures hearing this Juan how quickly replied that's right I think so too he continued it makes sense it seems that the one who understands yiu the most is still our Yin upon hearing Juan how's words Yin Juan's face immediately turned red she stammered you what are you saying Sulu next to her also expressed agreement of course Yi Wu is very reliable I have never doubted him I feel the same another person added Juan how thought to himself all right gin Juan I help you push the boat and you join the others on the same side it seems Yu will be lucky later these women are united in support of an outsider for him seeing that everyone was going a bit off topic yiu pretended to cough and said I have tried hard to Shield but unfortunately it didn't work after breaking through the atmosphere the oone layer of the Earth will lose its Effectiveness therefore from space observing the Earth all indicators related to the capabilities and protective measures on Earth are very likely to become ineffective upon hearing this everyone was in a panic there 's also such a thing so everything we are doing now in the eyes of the east region is like running around naked right y Wu conly said what I want is for all of them to see that the magic crystal is not suitable for a non-corrupted state we can only rely on collecting fossil fuel to power the spaceship our next goal is to collect enough fuel for this ship we will all act separately each person will disperse to collect fossil fuel which can effectively divert attention from the east region on the other hand the east region will itely Focus their attention on me therefore I will act as bait to lead them away I leave the task of collecting fossil fuel to all of you XA Chen anxiously said that's a good idea but can our conversation right now be overheard by the satellites of the east region Yu replied of course not the people of the east region can only see what we are doing but they cannot hear what we are saying their satellites are not Advanced enough for that G1 Chum continued according to yiwu the biggest challenge ahead is how to find fossil fuel or ancient relics in a short time Juan how agreed the captain is right the most difficult part of this mission is that I am not afraid of fighting but I really am not good at finding things this had been anticipated by yiu he opened the map and said to everyone you don't need to worry about this I have already made arrangements the monsters all over the world are currently carrying out the tasks I assigned a monster stepped forward to report King I have found the ancient ruins you mentioned there I can also smell a fossil fuel as you described this place has a lot of untapped fossil fuel y Wu nodded in satisfaction well done you have worked hard the monster hurriedly replied it's not hard at all King we only did a small thing yet we are praised by you oh my life is truly fulfilling King please wait we will continue to search for more fossil fuel and ancient ruins for you hurry up everyone keep searching on Yu's map bright spots began to appear marked by the monsters these were the locations containing oil and fuel someone spoke up looking surprised vwoo are you really using the monsters to scout the map if it were before no one would dare to think about this the monsters that have turned into Juniors can help you become the monster King this is truly amazing Yu pondered this cannot be delayed everyone let's split up and take out action after identifying the exact location everyone immediately flew in together after assigning the mission to search for fossil fuels to everyone Yi Wu said Mone team your strength is very impressive I hope you can split up and act separately each person responsible for a sight that way we can distract the attention of the east region Yin huan immediately huged gu Wu's left arm her voice full of concern vwoo it's too dangerous for you to act as ba alone I will team up with you this does not contradict your plan to separate the Mong team Kai quickly approached hugging y Wu's right arm if that's the case I also want to go with you y woo Kai casai thought to herself with ywo strength I am not worried about him being in danger as bait what I worry about more is letting him act alone with Yin Juan Yin Juan showed her displeasure looking at kayak's ey y Wu has me to assist and protect him that's enough there's no need for you to interfere Kai xai immediately reacted not willing to back down I am not interfering at all I just want to be a companion and let each person fulfill their own responsibility seeing the tense situation Sulu also chimed in since you two have said so then we don't mind making it a bigger deal you woo I also want to team up with you J Wang Chuan was extremely upset upon seeing this and the others felt the same even Tulu senior Cho Chen was also exasperated there is a saying three women one drama you'll have to fend for yourself then y Wu lightly coughed and then got straight to the point we should disperse our actions it will be more effective that way before he could finish speaking Juan how interrupted you don't need to worry about the efficiency of the search after all it's just looking for oil nothing difficult about it moreover the monsters right now aren't a threat you can rest easy and leave it to us instead y woo you should treat yourself a little haha y wo was at a loss for words in response to Juan how at that moment yanf ran over and said I want to be in the same group as you he immediately refuse no way you have to be in a group with ji Wang Chuan hearing Yu say that yanf looked displeased huh what's that based on I don't want to G wine Chun also seemed a bit unhappy vwo don't joke like that Juan how then came closer and whispered V wo are you serious you're going to sell your own sister off are you just hoping our team leader will become your brother-in-law Yu was at a loss for words for the second time he patted his younger sister's head and asked yanf do you want to become stronger if you do you must follow a true expert to train yourself Yuni nodded of course I want to but you IU interrupted there are no butts if you stay by my side I will only keep you shrunk down unable to progress having said that he turned to GW Chuan and said please take care of my sister a bit considering a favor I owe you yeu thoughted himself it is not safe at all for me act as bait allowing Yan fate to follow it's better to lever stay with someone capable of protecting her GW Chun replied coldly she can follow me but I won't purposefully take care of her hearing this yanf angrily retorted who needs you to take care of me I can take care of myself jiwang Chun Shrugged that's for the best then Yuni became even more Furious what is your attitude if it weren't for my brother's Arrangement who would want to follow you Yu was at a loss for words for the third time he didn't know whether his decision was right or wrong at that moment sha Chen finally spoke up are you acting as bait while also looking for fossil fuels he thought to himself this maneuver is intentionally pushing others away not only because using bait is dangerous but certainly there is some other calculation behind it yiu indeed had a different plan this time he wanted to bait and also intended to find senior my this surprised XA Chen greatly and he actively offered to go along I will go with you after all that old man is considered my mentor Yu agreed yes if we're looking for someone having an acquaintance along is definitely the best seen changes to the east region satellite surveillance a staff member reported boss the group in the southwest region has already set off they probably have some scheme in mind shouldn't we continue monitoring Victor replied there's no need to focus too intensely just keep close tabs on the kid named y wo wherever he goes we followed him the others are unimportant then Victor asked how is the progress on the second Rockets creation the staff member responded everything is on track it will be ready to launch in 15 days Victor continued what about the satellite weapon testing sir the testing is ongoing continuously the laser power has been enhanced from low roof orbit we can accurately strike any Target on the ground as long as we reach the required energy level he said good continue to accelerate the progress letting the Southwest safe Zone betray us again killing the people I sent y woo you won't be able to enjoy your victory for long just wait until the satellite weapons are ready all your constructions will be destroyed in an instant by then even you won't escape death when returning to Safe Zone number two someone asked the others have already set off how can we find Muay yiu replied Uncle don't worry I had my own way he silently thought previously I tried using the Mind compass but the system indicated that the target's level was too high to lock on it seems like I have no choice but to use this trick once more after that yiu used the skill of greed perception to Pinpoint mu's location but failed he questioned strange why can't I sense mu Way's whereabouts not giving up Yu summoned the greed demon as soon as it appeared the demon laughed heartily haha y woo you called me here you must be greedy for something again he would asked why can't I sense anything when I use the greed perception ability the greed demon replied greed perception is a passive ability when you develop a strong enough desire for something this ability will automatically sense the necessary direction to satisfy that greed if you cannot sense anything it only means your desire is not strong enough my dear suddenly Kai exai took the initiative to hug y wo from behind she softly said y woo after a long time of training I finally understand that my greatest ability and value is my capacity to enhance through multiple real battles and leveling up I can now turn this passive ability into an active one youu looked at Kai XA and noded to Signal her to continue kexi said right now I can help you maximize your greed but you need to prepare yourself really well y replied I ready immediately Kai XI activated her skill helping y Wu reach the limit limit of his greed the feeling of greed within him began to explode without bounds the things that were once mere small desires now transformed into intense Cravings he laughed haha here it is this is the feeling I want to dominate the world I want all women in the world I want to possess all the assets and power he continued I want I want even more just at that moment when ywu thought about meeting new way a portal appeared before him leading into the dungeon this is the entrance to some dungeon could it be that mu way is inside identifying the location of mu way y Wu then said the location of mu way has been determined system dissolve the state of greed gu Wu's body was undergoing strange reactions at this moment leaving him bewildered what is happening my heart is racing too fast my whole body feels like it's being burned I feel like I'm about to explode he mumbled truly feeling uncomfortable the system immediately announced due to the host greed dramatically increasing in an instant this has affected the other seven desires this state will last for 4 hours Yin Ruan rushed over in panic her voice full of concern why wo what's wrong is something not right Kai silen interjected analyzing seriously it must be that his greed was exaggerated too much just now leading to an impact on the other desires theoretically as long as you release the desires you can stabilize hearing this yiu immediately hugged both girls tightly thinking to himself really I can't stand it anymore realizing the situation yinan quickly understood she whispered gently y woo I understand now you don't have to suppress yourself I don't want to see you uncomfortable like this if it were you I would be willing to help kayak sane softly added me too it's my fault for not being able to control my greed causing you to suffer I am willing to help you return to normal suddenly Yu pushed the two girls away leaving them feeling quite taken aback he said in 5 hours we will regroup after saying that Yu Turned and Left leaving the two girls staring after him in a days both felt regretful about that cold action one of the girls sighed why woo wait however he continued walking while waving his hand decisively Not Looking Back you two don't need to follow me right now I need some quiet time alone Sho Chen stood nearby observing the situation and chuckled lightly haha this kid is really too Nave he complicates things for himself even in a mutual consent situation like this on the other hand Zulu found it interesting and nodded saying oh but I actually admire him it's good that he has the ability to self-control while his career hasn't taken off yet maintaining self-discipline is commendable a moment later in a private room Yi Wu sank down onto the sofa after having used up all the tissues in the room he sighed and murmured that was dangerous the side effects of greed almost made me lose control it seems I'll have to be more careful with this tactic in the future after all I'm fortunate that I finally pinpointed mu's location I think if muw is in the dungeon can muu also be there if so has muw been searching for his ancestor muu all along if muu is still alive then he must have developed the two primordial God spirits to their limits could these two God Spirits have an impact on the current world but the biggest question right now is after all this time will muu be a friend or a foe while yiu was still pondering about mu and muu the system suddenly chimed in with a notification in 10 minutes you will enter the world of the Shadow King as the mission progress has reached 50% the host May freely choose whether to enter or not yigu was slightly surprised then said the world of the Shadow King it has been quite a while since I last entered let me remind everyone about the final part so you remember last time he and Laguna with the help of the hunter Guild and the saintes Kina successfully entered the castle and disrupted the secret blood Cults conspiracy we also encountered the ancient god dark blood secret Lord but at that time we couldn't defeat it immediately also in an effort to restore the state of prosperity we had flown towards the Royal City intending to absorb a large amount of life force and fresh blood to help lagona absorb power the shadow King's Consciousness had been stimulated by militia's greed to ignite his desires before I withdrew Laguna in a state of dark transformation killed the undead of Christina and father ultimately absorbing the remaining Consciousness this time I intended to gather the ancient god baby then use it to absorb the spreading and heal that world in the end I would Elevate Laguna to the throne of King thinking that he said System enter the world of the Shadow King after capturing the ancient god baby I will have enough ancient gods by then the path to achieving the final level will be one step closer upon entering the Shadow King world the scene revealed Laguna frantically destroying the warship of the secret blood cult then she Unleashed her power her gaze Ablaze shouting I have endured enough of that Weak and Powerless version of myself always the one that no one can save unable to change anything from now on I completely bid farewell to the Past finally I have acquired the greatest power from now on I am the Lord of this world who lives and who dies is entirely under my control turning to me Laguna said vwoo let's go I can't wait any longer I want to destroy that ancient god special fellow avenge Christina and and sees this decaying world to break it down and rebuild it from scratch seeing the current image of Laguna completely contradicts the weak and timid Laguna from before you who thought to himself this Laguna's greed is vastly exaggerated could it also generate side effects nevertheless her determination is not bad perfectly aligns with my goals just as the two were about to take off to the Royal City Kina unexpectedly ran after them calling out loudly wait a moment I will go with you to the Royal City Kina the saintess of the hunter church was crying uncontrollably as she said sister the people they're suffering I must take revenge if we are to kill that ancient god who holds special powers I must have my part meanwhile in the Royal City the ancient god dark blood secret Lord was spreading a plague transforming people into beasts and forcing them to slaughter each other the blood was already abundant but he wanted even more the cries for help echoed everywhere help someone please save us those transformed into monsters were devouring humans thus the catastrophe continued to spread unchecked the Army was struggling to resist the ancient god but it was like grasshoppers trying to move a stone a panicked voice echoed through the radio report report the entire Air Force has been wiped out in an instant ah no need to report anymore the Destroyer God has descended in front of it we are so small death we all must die ah in the Royal City the cries of Despair and hopelessness echoed incessantly further delighting the ancient god ha wonderful your wailing is a mesmerizing Melody let all of your blood flow the more fresh blood the quicker I recover the greater the death the stronger I become I am thoroughly enjoying these bags of blood from you all haha in this world no one can stop me anymore at this moment inside the Royal Palace chaos erupted everywhere many people scrambled for Treasures each seemingly driven mad one panic-stricken person exclaimed I've heard that the Army outside has been completely annihilated the entire Royal City has fallen let's quickly grab some valuable items and flee the princess of the Royal City collapsed to the ground tears streaming down her face she choked out why why has everything turned out like this just then the palace guards appeared they quickly dealt with the looters the shouts rang out please spare Our Lives we know we were wrong please let us go we won't dare again the princess saw the general appear and immediately pleaded it would be great if you could really come please take me with you to escape whatever reward you want in the future I will fulfill the general coldly stabbed the person beside him and then said who cares about your lives this blooded is for our brothers his eyes were filled with with ruthlessness as he turned to the princess your highness do you misunderstand something this is the apocalypse the royal power is no more what royal rewards are you talking about as he spoke he delivered a punch that knocked the princess to the ground his voice was full of mockery I can vent my anger on you but you are a good person in the past you were not bad to us my last piece of advice for you is stay in the palace do not go outside to die turning to to the brothers he ordered quickly take everything valuable that can be carried away the princess lay on the ground bitterly wondering why why has everything suddenly turned out like this is this country really finished like that she gradually fell into a state of unconsciousness a few hours later the princess woke up did I just faint oh my head hurts so much struggling to stand up the princess stepped outside to see the situation before her was a scene of olation not a single person in sight has everyone run away who will come to save me whoever it is please come the princess stepped outside the door as she looked up at the sky she was instantly overwhelmed by a horrifying sight a gigantic monster was hovering in the air her face turned desperate as she realized it was the demon god the one who had destroyed the Royal City at that moment the princess knew for certain that she could not Escape her tragic fate she Drew her sword her voice voice trembling yet filled with determination no one can save me anymore this nation has completely collapsed as a princess I also have no way out nothing left to lose but just as the sword touched her neck the princess instinctively halted in the Sky Three Strange glowing lights gradually descended her eyes sparkled with a glimmer of hope and she knelt down fervently praying oh Divine beings finally you have sent your Messengers please save us the innocent people Grant us love Purity Freedom peace and the strength to escape this suffering those three glowing lights were y woo lagona and Kina as they landed all three noticed a thick black barrier enveloping the entire Royal City Kina immediately said the Royal City has fallen we must break the barrier of the dark blood secret Lord right away to save everyone lagona was anxious and quickly deployed the barrier to separate the outside this showed that he had begun to feel fear he said now I will kill it after saying that Laguna attacked the barrier directly with the hand of the Shadow King however the barrier did not budge at all he was astonished how can this be this barrier clearly cannot be destroyed could it be that my power is still not enough seeing this the dark blood secret Lord laughed smudy he said you are too late I have become much stronger than before just a little more and I will restore my Peak State at that time you will only be able to watch as I continue to become invincible without being able to do anything y Wu chuckled softly confidently oh is that so he then summoned the ancient god origin of nature returned to Oneness the purpose was not to engage in battle but to use the time space transformation ability to bring the three of them inside the barrier by the way he wanted to show a bit of majesty making the dark blood secret Lord feel fear Kina thought to herself astonished it's possible to get in who exactly is this kid although I had already guessed he was very powerful it seems that I had underestimated him too much before dark blood's secret Lord was extremely startled upon witnessing this scene you have another ancient God within you and even at a higher level Laguna replied yay woo I know you won't deal with him it shouldn't be difficult but please hand him over to me he is the root of all misfortunes I want to take revenge for Christina for the count less innocent lives that have perished tragically and for myself as well ye W nodded flew away and said all right I will leave him to you Kina letun go rescue the surviving civilians and stop bet from continuing to use their blood to make him stronger at this moment only two figures remained on the battlefield Laguna stared directly at the ancient god gritting his teeth and said I will kill you hearing this the ancient god laughed heartily ha a defeated foe dares to be arrogant even if you didn't come to die today I would eventually seek you out as soon as he finished speaking lagon immediately severed one of his tentacles surprising him you have grown stronger than before you can inflict some damage on me but don't waste your energy for every person in this Royal City there is a corresponding bag of blood for me no matter how injured I am I can always recover back to my original state using those bags of blood he thought moreover I can become strong and stronger the biggest mistake of yours is daring to attack a deity with a mere mortal body after saying that he used his tentacle to strike lagona down hard onto the ground the impact caused rocks and dirt to explode making everyone believe that lagona had been severely injured but unexpectedly Not only was she unharmed but she also exuded even more power Laguna suddenly unleashed the huge strength from within her body then coldly laughed a deity haha this makes me look forward to the next battle with you as a deity do you know what it feels like to experience pain like a mortal just as the two were locked in a tense battle the princess of the Royal City unexpectedly appeared causing Laguna to be distracted Laguna looked at the princess in surprise you you were the one I met before in an instant memories flooded back Laguna recalled the past when she was just an ordinary kid standing by the roadside watching the Army march by at that time the princess was riding a horse accompanied by a general the general spoke up worried if you want to know the situation of the people's lives we can report to you at the palace you should return quickly If His Highness finds out about this we will also be punished the princess replied as the princess of this nation I must naturally understand the lives of my subjects myself if father were to know he would certainly support me they had walked for a while when suddenly they saw a woman kneeling in the middle of the road holding the child in pleading is it the princess please please save my poor child the guards immediately Drew their weapons towards her and shouted impudent who is this commoner daring to disturb the princess's Royal procession get out of the way immediately the princess dismounted her horse visibly displeased and reprimanded the guards what are you trying to do your swords are meant for fighting enemies and protecting the people sheath them now yes yes the prince gently spoke to the woman don't worry let me see the child's wound as she spoke the princess reached out to touch the child the woman instinctively recoiled and said your highness please don't we are filthy it's better to send someone else the woman sobbed and recounted the situation we were attacked by wild beasts outside the city my husband in order to protect us died it was with great difficulty that I managed to bring the child back to town but the the doctors see the child's wounds as too severe and refuse to treat him I truly have no other way but to stop your highness the princess suddenly drew a knife and cut into her own hand this action startled the woman next to her who immediately exclaimed your highness what are you doing however the princess merely let a few drops of blood fall into the mouth of the boy lying there and then calmly said it's okay don't worry I will heal your child the entire event had been witnessed by Laguna from start to finish returning to reality lagona saw the princess appear and immediately inquired princess given how dangerous the situation is right now why are you here all alone the princess trembled all over and replied the guards and servants in the palace have all abandoned me and fled I truly thank you for risking your life to confront the monster and trying to help the people of the Royal City you possess a courage that no one else has but even so you cannot defeat that monster you don't need to put your life on the line against it how about we escape together laguma spread his wings and said no I have my own reasons I must kill it princess you should find your own way to escape just as Laguna was about to take off to confront the ancient god the princess quickly grabbed his hand and said wait if you really have to fight that monster perhaps I can help you my blood may have some effect as she spoke the princess took a knife and cut her hand then offered the blood to Laguna since I was young I have known that my blood carries a unique power it is because of my blood that the royal family and the Nobles have not been infected with the play as they use my blood to create a special medicine moreover my blood has the ability to stimulate and enhance the combat abilities of the royal soldiers Laguna saw Blood on the princess's hand his eyes like a hungry tiger spotting its prey nevertheless he still tried to control himself thinking aside from her healing ability her blood possesses a ulous power but why do I feel such a strong desire for her blood without hesitation Laguna tore a piece of his clothing to refused the princess's blood then wrapped her wound saying thank you for your kindness princess but no matter what I cannot accept harming you in exchange for power this small act though insignificant moved the princess deeply she thought to herself what is happening to me I have never felt anything for those Royal Nobles before but this person person in front of me makes my heart flutter as if even the blood in my veins is drawn to him after bandaging the princess Laguna spread his wings preparing to fly off to face the ancient god before leaving he turned back and said princess please find a safe place quickly the princess Stood Still For a Moment clasping her hands in prayer oh Divine being if you truly exist please protect him and keep him safe in another place yiu was still looking for ways to support lagona in this perilous battle regarding this and de CH Laguna men do ancient god de vuut man CH katuna I must let beer allow Laguna to face the ancient god by himself to complete the mission but at the same time I also need to stop be rare from continuing to exploit the blood sucking formation to increase his power otherwise the battle situation will become increasingly unfavorable for lagona not thinking any further yeu immediately summon the ancient god play of Cami bino he said bino blood rain can also be considered a form of plague with your abilities absorbing the plague should definitely not be a problem right beo confidently replied of course not not only can I absorb it but I can also become stronger from the energy derived from it immediately beo activated his powers absorbing all the plagues spreading throughout the Royal City in an instant all the citizens in the city returned to their normal State this not only helped y w resolve the plague but also Advanced the progress of the ancient god plague of Calamity Mission the system quickly announc task completion progress for the branch Mission plague 80% once the plague had been dealt with Yu did not hesitate and summon the ancient god quii he said quii next I will ask you to use your powers to move all the citizens of the Royal City to safety quii nodded immediately activating the formation and replied this is just a small task for me suddenly quii exclaimed in Surprise strange there is still one person who has not been teleported except for this person I have taken all the others away but this person is very special resisting my spatial transfer yiu was quite surprised and immediately went to check who it was as it turned out the last person who could not be teleported was the princess of the Royal City she was kneeling continuously praying for Laguna at the same time yiu approached her and thought to himself the person quii cannot teleport as her dressed in this attire and being in the palace she must be the princess is the blood on the ground hers that blood gives me a sense of an immense power and a special enhancement of ility she is indeed not an ordinary person when Yu got closer the princess opened her eyes looked at him and said you are one of the three who have flown here I have met your teammate but he refused to accept my blood even though my blood could make him stronger suddenly the system announced progress on the main quest has increased by 10% this surprised Yu he thought the progress of the main quest has increased so this is the next Direction it seemed seems that if Laguna wants to become king he not only needs to absorb the blood of the princess but must also become the royal son of the royal family Laguna is still fighting fiercely against the ancient god but it seems he has yet to gain the upper hand as Laguna's attack rushes toward him the ancient god smirks and says relying solely on the body of a moral to endure until now you truly exceed my expectations but this won't last long you know why with that the ancient god swings his tent piercing through the blood arm that Laguna had just created and stabbing straight through his chest leaving a large hole however immediately laguni uses his own blood to form a new arm grabbing the ancient God's tentacle watching this action the ancient God continues we all fight using the power of blood but you can only use your own blood that means your blood will soon run dry as for me I absorb the blood of the entire Royal City my power is Limitless growing strong ER by the moment Laguna pulls the ancient God's tentacle out thinking to himself his strength has truly surpassed before but why hasn't y wo made a move yet the situation is becoming increasingly dire and a part of the Shadow King's Consciousness appears echoing in Laguna's mind why why don't you drain the princess's blood clearly her blood is very important to us if this continues we will perish the Shadow King continued I am the true form of all source of Haunting power at this moment you must listen to me lagona despite being in a perilous situation resolutely held firm to his decision and replied enough do not tempt me any longer I am acutely aware of the importance of that bloodline as well as the extent of my own craving for it it is precisely because of this that I am all the more aware that if I cross this line I will find it difficult to control the thirst for fresh blood within me when that thirst arises all I see in the future is destruction ruins corpses and blood nothing but that I am certain I will fall into an abyss of Eternal damnation I do not want to become that and I will absolutely not let it happen the voice in his Consciousness echoed again filled with persuasion is it possible that your concerns are more important than revenge think of the people who matter most to you shouldn't they deserve to die pitifully in vain your dearest ones are already dead to you are others really that significant Laguna gritted his teeth and stood up continuing to charge at the ancient god his heart filled with conflict secretly thinking the voice in my head is not without reason if I do not use the power of that bloodline relying solely on my current state I fundamentally cannot defeat Bayer my loved ones certainly should not die in vain but do others deserve to become victims in my quest for Revenge the attacks from lagona were becoming weaker while the ancient god remained completely unharmed the T tentacles of the ancient god continuously pierced through Laguna's body making the situation increasingly unfavorable the Consciousness echoed again trying to persuade Laguna don't hesitate any longer even if you don't absorb that bloodline this world will still be destroyed by the ancient god this destruction is predetermined so why don't you do it use the power of that bloodline to take revenge we will achieve this goal together watching From Below Yu couldn't help but feel anxious thinking to himself is Laguna still hesitating and confused if he doesn't make a final decision he will never be able to defeat the Ancient God upon hearing this the princess beside him softly spoke so his name is Laguna he is not hesitating or faltering instead he is showing an incredibly firm will earlier I could clearly sense his intense desire for my bloodline but he restrained himself and even gently bandaged my wounds although we have just met for the first time I can deeply feel the strong will radiating from that person listening to these words Yi Wu was quite surprised silently thinking it seems Laguna has recognized the special nature of the princess's bloodline he is trying his best to resist this fate isn't he but Laguna's Destiny has already been predetermined on the battlefield Laguna was torn apart by the ancient god blood flowing copiously the Consciousness within was extremely anxious loudly urging his uncle you can't hesitate any longer you won't be able to endure for long you still have a choice before complete failure quickly drained the blood of the princess but Laguna remained adamant refusing to listen he tried to heal his wounds and continued to charge forward to attack responding no that is not a choice I yearn to grow stronger not to be controlled by Fate but to change it to seize my own destiny I will never bow my head to anything no matter the outcome I will not give up Laguna was once again Torn to Pieces by the tentacles of the ancient god just before he could reach him seeing the situation deteriorate further yiu below grew increasingly anxious he silently thought this is the final stage Laguna cannot change the course of the impending fate no matter how hard he fights it is all in vain the ancient god looked at Laguna continuously recovering his body and suddenly spoke oh it turns out there is still another source of power within you no wonder you have been able to endure for so long each time I tear you apart you regenerate thanks to it that power is truly astonishing but what impresses me is your unyielding will human I underestimated you before now I acknowledge you as a worthy opponent and to show my respect I will send you off with this punch allowing you to feel all your pain before leaving this world the ancient god coldly laughed raised his gigantic Fist and and prepared to deliver the final blow as the words faded the ancient god gathered all his strength to deliver a punch piercing straight through Laguna's body creating a fatal wound the punch continued to resonate down to the ground coming dangerously close to the princess at this moment Laguna's body was riddled with holes blood gushing everywhere seeing this the princess hurriedly ran over quickly supporting Laguna in her arms lying in the princess's Embrace Laguna murmured weakly continuously muttering no no I will not accept this fate high above the ancient god noticing the princess exclaimed in surprise in this Royal City there is a human who has not been infected by the plague wait a moment there is an unusual Aura emanating from her it is a threat her existence is a danger that cannot be allowed to survive as soon as he finished speaking the ancient god immediately charged towards the princess launching a full force attack but just when the massive tentacle was about to reach her a hand unexpectedly reached out gently grasping the tentacle as if it were nothing more than a trivial object this action left the ancient god horrified and he screamed what is happening what is this power Yu observing from a distance spoke up this is Laguna's final transformation you must not interfere having said that he fell into deep thought pondering Laguna's fate cannot be changed but he dares to resist strongly should I follow the path that has been predetermined for him or stand by his side to fight against fate together on this side the princess had begun to remove the bandage from her hand preparing to give her blood to lagona however Laguna still tried to refuse his voice weak but full of determination no you can't do that I do not want to lose myself and I certainly do not want all life in this world to pay the price for my revenge I do not want to create a monster more ruthless than the one I seek to destroy moreover I would rather sacrifice myself than ever do that the princess shook her head her eyes filled with tears but her voice was Resolute I'm sorry I don't understand what you're saying but if it means saving you I am ready to use my blood I cannot just stand by and watch you die without doing anything just as the princess was about to drip her blood into Laguna's mouth Yu suddenly appeared gripping her hand tightly stopping that action the princess turned back in panic her voice full of anger what are you doing don't you want me to save him meanwhile the system in Yu's mind was continuously sounding alarms host please do not forcibly intervene in the main storyline if you continue your Shadow King account will be forcibly deleted despite the warnings Yu did not release the princess's hand meeting her furious gaze he said his voice dropping no stop I know you want to save him but this is not the way the princess pushed Yi Wu's hand away and shouted get off me if this goes on Laguna will die at that moment the system continued to issue warnings warning the host must not disturb the main storyline Please Release your hand immediately Yu fully aware of the risks posed by the systems warnings remained steadfast in his decision internally he was battling fiercely I do this for Laguna for a future that he can choose for himself not under the influence of anyone even fate itself Laguna is still risking everything to resist the temptation of the power of blood even though that power lies right before him and could be easily obtained he remains Resolute and refuses to yield this unyielding will seems to Echo in his mind you would rather die than become the Shadow King is this your final Choice Laguna yiu standing beside and observing everything immediately asks the system will the Shadow King account disappear if I intervene and alter the timeline the system responds in a calm but icy tone that is correct the host should understand that your encounter with lagona as well as his becoming the shadow cane is an inevitable result of the flow of fade please do not blame yourself too much however if you deliberately intervene to prevent lagona from becoming the shadow cane the event of you obtaining the shadow cane account will not occur either the account you currently possess will completely disappear please think carefully before taking action Yu is stunned by the systems warning Agony Rising within him he tells himself in order to complete the mission and keep this account I have gradually pushed Laguna onto the path of evil I am the one who has caused him to end up in this situation Laguna has never doubted me in fact he always regards me as his most trustworthy friend if I continue to push him into the abyss of evil for personal gain how am I any different from those despicable Scoundrels who betray their friends for power but then yiu hesitates his heart full of conflict but do I have the right to change this predetermined fate and can I save him without losing everything Yu realized that his reasoning was so convincing that even the system could not refute it he thought the Shadow King has indeed helped me a lot and losing this account is truly a Pity but now I am much stronger than I was at the beginning when I was just a weak child relying on the power of the Shadow King to overcome dangers now I have the assistance of countless ancient gods and more importantly I have come to understand that friendship and loyalty are more valuable than strength after that y w ask the system an important question system I want to ask one thing throughout this time I have used the shadow came account to defeat many powerful enemies if this account disappears will it affect the events that have occurred in the past the system replied its tone still calm and emotionless in principle the two timelines operate into independently but there is still some influence however any differing details will be corrected by the world's coercive Force the only thing that will remain is the final result of the Shadow King depending on whether he exists or not Yu pondered so that's how it is while he was still thinking the battle situation took a turn for the worse on the other side quii had fallen into a disadvantage against the enemy looking at the foe who was overwhelming him Wii whispered to himself this guy I thought he was weak but turns out he is incredibly strong the enemy in front sneered with a contemptuous expression quii you are a full-fledged ancient god yet you willingly obey the commands of humans don't you feel ashamed quii while raising a defensive Shield coldly replied hemp you are truly a fool I see you completely do not understand what is happening think carefully who would willingly work for humans in the first place here he ing quii say that b r became even more confused and sneered are you trying to say that you were defeated by that human how is that possible you are the ancient gods how could you let an ordinary human defeat you he must have used some despicable trick but I will not fall into the same trap as you right now I will kill that human and all of you as soon as he finished speaking ancient god bear rare continuously attacked qu Shield his powerful strikes quickly created countless cracks on the Shield making it nearly unable to withstand any longer on this side y Wu had found the answer for himself and for Laguna he stepped forward towards ancient god barrier preparing to confront him meanwhile the princess was still crying and pleading don't worry about me let Laguna drain my blood save him seeing Yu step forward Laguna couldn't help but be surprised and asked what are you planning to do yiu turned his head back his eyes full of determination if you have decided to fight to the end against this DN fate then how can I Stand By and Watch You bear it alone you have done enough the rest let me handle it at that moment hui's Shield finally shattered and he was defeated by Beer's Relentless attacks without hesitation Bay rare launched a fatal strike using endless bloody stabs aimed directly at Yu he growled want to be a hero then let me see what you are capable of to dare to confront an ancient god the terrifying tentacles of Bayer lunged straight towards yiu but just as they were about to touch him a strange light flashed the gigantic tentacles were instantly petrified by a mysterious curse turning to Stone right before his eyes the entire Battlefield froze for a moment and Beer's astonished gaze was fixed on yiu seeing this bear was greatly surprised and said the petrifying power among the ancient gods that can turn others to Stone there is only Larin it really is you Lin looked at in with countless eyes and coldly said Gul Lulu bear immediately severed the Petrified tentacles and then stepped back saying all right all of you are nothing but hunting dogs for humans truly disgraceful for the ancient gods today I will clean up the traitors on behalf of the ancient gods as soon as he finished speaking bear used the Anna and blood control move to attack ywu causing the male Lee to lose a significant amount of blood he then sneered and said no matter how you can control the ancient gods in the end you are just a mortal body as long as you have a drop of blood in your body killing you is as easy as turning over a hand he continued in a harsh tone go to hell like a typical villain he died from talking too much before he could lay a hand on Yu he was infected by the virus from the ancient god pled of Calamity and was completely controlled H my limbs why will they obey bear was astonished then realized it's the power of the virus this time it's you Boo the ancient god played of Calamity beo appeared and gave him a sincere piece of advice give up the struggle bear you have no chance of winning Yu did not hesitate and summoned the third ancient god however bear still refused to yield he immediately used the technique blueing sea poison to eliminate the blood containing the virus he sneered and said said it's just a trivial virus what can it do to me without blood how can the poison cling to me if you have any other tricks feel free to use them but before he could bask in his arrogance an attack descended from the sky striking him squarely in the face and driving him head first into the ground this attack was called chaos world and the one who Unleashed it was the ancient god Sadia upon appearing Seria coldly said the system of rules seems to have little effect on you then as you wish Let Us return to the most Primal violence seeing the fourth ancient god of ywu bear couldn't help but feel Panic he shouted in Anger Seria do you want to die too damn it damn it why do all of you want to block my path how can you control a four ancient gods in turn like this that kid are you really a person of this world why have you never shown your power before what is your ultimate goal ye who looked at him and calmly replied this has nothing to do with you you only have two choices either submit and retain your Consciousness or die and become my tool as soon as he finished speaking bear immediately turned and ran shouting as he fled ridiculous how could I ever submit to you like those four disgraceful ones dream on seeing beay air fleeing Sero is casting a spell while asking Yu do you want to finish him off just give the order and I will take action at that moment the system announced if you kill Bayer Laguna will completely be unable to become the shadow cane and the Shadow King account will disappear this is the final option please consider it carefully host Yu did not hesitate giving a Resolute command Seria finish him off immediately ancient god Seria harnessed her strength and Unleashed a will of chaos that pierced straight through Bay R before dying beay R st Sly shouted damn it I am not reconciled his voice gradually faded as his body was utterly torn apart by the energy beam the system quickly reported ancient god bear has been eliminated the host has obtained Bears summoning magic Crystal y Wu held the magic crystal in his hand looking at it with satisfaction saying so now everything has been concluded the princess witnessing everything from a distance could not hide her astonishment and exclaimed you y wo you really can kill an ancient god meanwhile Laguna was trying to stand up staggering towards ywo he attempted to say something but before he could finish he collapsed and fainted the princess hurriedly ran over to support lagona anxiously asking lagona what's wrong are you okay the next day lagona was taken back to a room to recuperate resting after the brutal battle in the quiet room gentle light streamed through the window everything seemed to finally returned to peace ywu stood by the window his gaze contemplative as he looked into the distance from a world once filled with the smell of blood and death everything had now become bright and full of life outside Yin guan's voice echoed everywhere the city wall has been breached bring the stones and Scaffolding here hurry up Brothers Let's do our best to restore the glory of Royal City as soon as possible the atmosphere was filled with hope and positive energy at that moment a part part of the Shadow K's Consciousness suddenly emerged separating from Laguna's body its cold voice rang out why have you changed your mind at the last minute didn't you try to drag him down into the abyss for a long time Yi Wu turned around and calmly replied laguma has always held on to his faith he did not allow hatred and anger to consume himself but fought to the end against his fate I really can't bear to push him into the abyss of Despair anymore the Shadow King sneered contemptuously his voice dripping with disdain I thought you were a man full of ambition and schemes unexpectedly you are just like lagona a navely foolish person ye wo chuckled lightly responding ha who would have known but on the contrary I have a question now that the whole world has been purified and darkness is no longer present can your power still exist the shadow came narrowed his eyes his tone becoming sharp do not underestimate me when this world was submerged merged in darkness my power came from blood and fear but if this world is filled with light then that light is my glory you need to remember I am the Shadow King wherever the stars shine there I am Darkness born from light ye W fell silent staring directly into the eyes of the Shadow King light and darkness in this world seem to always coexist never to be separated yeu said no wonder you were the Shadow King this Aura has never diminished the Shadow King asked back I sense a strange spatial fluctuation are you planning to leave yiu nodded and replied mom goodbye here we will never meet again at that moment the system announced the dungeon task has concluded teleportation will soon begin please prepare host before leaving Yu did not forget to say his final words farewell Laguna my friend the Shadow King gently replied in my eyes nothing can permanently sever time all things are embraced by the stars and you are no exception Yu smiled and responded although I don't fully understand perhaps I will believe that what you said is beautiful as the two shook hands a beam of light Shone down from above enveloping y Wu and bringing him back to reality when Yu returned the shadow can account he had once used was also gradually Vanishing Yi Wu quietly said I'm back yet you still haven't disappeared were you specially waiting for me to say goodbye he smiled and continued then farewell Shadow King thank you for taking care of me all this time suddenly the system announced again warning a powerful and unknown force is interfering the account card is undergoing anomalies shortly after another announcement appeared the Shadow King account is about to be upgraded to a completely new Shadow Lord account y Wu suddenly exclaimed what the Shadow King account has broken the shackles of Fate leveling up to become the shadow Lord controlling the mental power over the long years he has stepped through the Stars venturing to the ends of the universe just to seat the whereabouts of a beloved acquaintance he deeply misses in the end he returned to the Embrace of the Starry Sky transforming into the Supreme will of the star after reading the information yiu was once again astonished exclaiming the shadow cane account not only did not disappear but also leveled up but these chains what the hell is happening the system immediately explained because the original account possesses extraordinary strength this has created a certain impact on the system hence it has been locked this is an extreme case the host need not worry Yu continue to ask how can I use this account the system replied with the host's current strength this is not impossible however this account contains many obsessions of the original owner to use it the host must remove those obsessions Yi Wu furrowed his brow contemplatively stating obsessions couldn't be the Beloved acquaintance that the shadow Lord missed could it be Laguna perhaps he wanted to see me one last time but couldn't so the obsession was born the system continued that's correct if the host wishes to use this account it is essential to go back and meet Laguna One Last Time returning to Laguna's world after a long month of coma he finally woke up as soon as he opened his eyes Laguna immediately asked where is y woo the Shadow King standing beside him replied calmly he is already gone he will never return hearing this Laguna was stunned and immediately asked back his voice filled with worry what do you mean where has ye W gone the Shadow King fell silent for a moment and then slowly recounted everything that had happened from the fact that ye who did not belong to this world to his final choices after listening Laguna was Dazed his eyes filled with pain and confusion so y Wu really is not a person from this world turns out he has always wanted me to become the Shadow King The Shadow King looked at Laguna and gently asked do you hate him lagona shook his head a sad smile emerging hate how could I possibly hate him on this perilous Journey if it weren't for Yu I don't know how many times I would have died he protected me guided me me was my adviser my partner and even more than that he was my family I understand that Yu is so formidable how could he always stay by my side he must have his own goals but no matter what I trust him and steadfastly support him as he said this Laguna lowered his head his voice trailing off filled with sadness but why in the end am I still all alone why do those who are important to me always leave yo Will will you really not come back at that moment the door to the room suddenly opened and the princess ran in her face radiant her eyes full of joy Laguna are you awake immediately the princess Hub lagona tightly joyfully saying good so good you have been in a coma for a whole month I was really scared you wouldn't wake up again Laguna smiled gently saying princess don't worry after a moment the two released each other stood up and and held hands the princess looked at Laguna her eyes filled with hope asking so lagona from now on will you always be by my side Laguna did not answer immediately only silently squeezed her hand then they both stepped outside to participate in the Victory Parade the princess stood before the crowd solemnly announcing please listen everyone today I want to introduce to you a hero the person next to me is the hero who has saved our Royal City lagona the citizens were Overjoyed cheering loudly and clapping incessantly some even asking what Lord Laguna you are our savior Laguna quietly said to the princess princess I am not deserving the princess hurriedly explained I understand your intention but your friend has long since departed I have sent people searching everywhere but found no trace of him if you hadn't fought bravely against the ancient god everyone here would not have survived therefore you can hold your head high and be proud this glory is entirely yours a hero cannot flee at this moment Laguna nodded and replied you are right then in its heart he silently thought ye wo I will protect the glory that rightfully Belongs to You years ago the hero Laguna defeated the ancient god that occupied the Royal City freeing the world from their domination finally the world welcomed peace after so many years of war after that the princess as Ed to the throne and married the hero lagona holding a grand wedding unprecedented in history a year later the queen gave birth to a son naming him how in memory of a close friend of the hero lagona the hero Laguna continued to lead the army fighting in various places ultimately eliminating all the monsters that threatened the world however why did he always wear a look of desolation and loneliness on his face he pondered vay woo if only you were here to fight alongside me how wonderful it would be will you really not return I will not stop searching for you if I cannot find you on the ground I will Ascend to the sky to those Stars one day you and I will finally meet again decades later the queen passed away and the entire nation mourned the hero lagona ascended to the throne time flowed swiftly and tens of thousands of years later the world underwent Earth shattering changes but the only thing that remained unchanged was King auna under the rule of the immortal Emperor Humanity finally managed to leave their Planet directing themselves into the vast and unfamiliar Universe not knowing where it would end the Shadow King appeared looking at Laguna and said it's time for us to return to the Stars Laguna replied wait a moment I have always persevered in staying in this world for one reason I believe you will surely come back tens of thousands of years have passed what's the harm in waiting a little longer the Shadow King responded his tone serious Vine wo is no longer in this world you must accept that truth the lifespan of this planet has come to an end if we do not leave we will not be able to make it in time Laguna was silent for a moment then resolutely said if that is the case I will Traverse through space and the universe searching anywhere until I find him I will never give up the shadow C shook his head chuckling softly you remain as stubborn as ever at that moment an incredibly familiar voice echoed leaving laguma in disbelief even after tens of thousands of years that voice was unmistakable Laguna panicked and exclaimed V Woo is that you immediately Laguna turned around and saw y wo saying I thought I truly would never find you again in this long endless life the thing I cannot forget the most is the adventures alongside you yugu smiled but he couldn't help being surprised as just by touching lud's hand he was transported to tens of thousands of years later fortunately this planet was in a time of apocalypse and everything seemed to still be salvageable Yu stepped in front of Laguna and said still want to Adventure lagona there are countless wonderful worlds waiting for us ahead as he spoke yiu extended his hand towards Laguna upon seeing yiu standing before him Laguna was so moved that he trembled as if he could not believe this reality after a moment he grasped Yu's hand and said let's adventure together at that moment the system announced Shadow Lord account has been unlocked congratulations host after y Wu abandoned the shadow Kane account his account evolved and became the lord of the Stars 100 times more powerful than the old account y Wu asked the system this is the lord of the Stars account so can the system tell me what abilities it has the system replied this account possesses specific powers that have yet to be clarified the host will need to explore them through practical combat as this account comes from a higher Dimension it can only exert its full strength in the universe or Cosmic attribute dungeons in the current world it can only use 50% of its Force hearing the systems explanation yiwu felt extremely disappointed what only 50% of my true power doesn't that mean this account is just a half-finished product too disappointing the explanation system said rest assured host do not worry too much although it can only exert 50% of its strength its power still far exceeds that of the Shadow King at its peak this Foundation is quite solid hearing this yiwu was extremely pleased so strong just at 50% and already more powerful than the Shadow King without any strange sign effects truly worthy of the lord of the Stars however he thought cautiously everything should still be approached with caution I recall before I had soared to a certain height and then the ability of the account suddenly vanished the universe seems to have certain restrictions on the system can this reason be explained the system replied based on observations there is no powerful force in the sky that we do not know however from the information gathered we can determine that the farther away from the ground the stronger the effect of this Force Yi Wu said worriedly even the system cannot clearly understand this Force this is really difficult to address the system continued there is no need for the host to worry too much as the power of the lord of the Stars account can completely handle this situation hearing this yiu felt much more confident his concerns about the universe lacking a trump card to respond began to fade away he smiled and said to himself then lagona let's move forward together introducing the account and the reason for becoming the lord of the Stars the endless Darkness was born as his Veil and the radiant stars were at his arms placing all things under his shade and protection leaving behind the illusion of the constellations at the farthest reaches of the universe he has many names lord of the Stars Lord of Light and Shadow Ancient of Days but still he is just a yearning young man wanting to embark on the journey with his best friend once more moments later at Yu's Fortress everyone had returned and Was preparing to begin their quest to find the Elder MyWay XO chin spoke up everyone I have returned welcome back Master XO chin continued I cannot believe you suggested looking for that old fellow and even brought along so many beautiful women Uncle I might as well follow you and have some fun yigu replied to find mu way uncle is the most important person without Uncle we cannot proceed Sulu chimed in moreover not only Mo way you even mentioned wanting to find the legendary hero muu is he really still alive Yin Ruan also said V wo you mentioned meeting muu in the Mist when you were young and even entrusted him with two Divine artifacts it's truly astonishing if you hadn't said it yourself I would really not be able to believe it kayaki said kxi is not quite sure what everyone is talking about but if it's something gu wo wants to do kai XI will definitely support it with all her strength after walking for a while they arrived at Nana's place when Nana saw Yi Wu she joyfully ran over and said Master this way Yu stepped forward patted Nana's head and praised her you've worked hard lately I'll come to see your Masterpiece Nana proudly replied Master rest assured Nana guarantees that this aircraft will far exceed the technological level of Earth you will definitely be amazed Yu then switched to the ace pilot account sham Hui and said nah I trust your skills and I'm really looking forward to it Sho Chan appeared confused and asked huh do we really have to sit in that thing Yu asked back what's wrong are you afraid of airplanes Uncle Sho Chen laughed and said ahaha that's right if not you guys go ahead I can go there by myself immediately Nana rushed over grabbed shio chin by the collar and angrily shouted H do you dare to doubt my skills don't compare your pile of scrap met from laca to the advanced technology of my Royal model we solved the issue of airplanes 800 years ago at technical level she growled if you don't believe can't you just sit down and find out for yourself Nana said today I absolutely won't allow you to leave with doubts sit down you have to sit for me today Cho Chan helplessly replied I'll sit I'll sit is that not good enough oh let go of me after everything was ready ye announced it's time to depart let's board the aircraft before leaving you did not forget to remind Nana take care of the house okay Nana replied don't worry master I will definitely protect this place well saying that you woo hurriedly set off flying towards the dungeon where mu was located safe travels Master this action of uo was detected by the satellites in the east region at the satellite monitoring station in the east region the alarm went off the technician reported report Yu has mobilized Victor gritted his teeth and said monitor him closely with the satellites lock down his trajectory for me I want to know even where he goes to the bathroom the technician replied yes sir suddenly a technician shouted in panic but ye Woods aircraft looks very strange its flight path completely violates the laws of physics Victor exclaimed what the hell throw the mon monitoring video onto the big screen for me to see wait a moment after the screen was projected seeing the terrifying speed of Y wo Victor exclaimed in panic damn it what kind of insane speed is this can the technician keep up with the recording the technician replied we've pushed to maximum capacity but we can only barely track the target for a bit more than 3 seconds Victor said 3 seconds so that means the technology of this fighter jet has already surpassed multiple generations of ours how is that possible moreover he's performing acrobatic Maneuvers at such a high speed if it were an ordinary aircraft the person inside would have been turned to fragments long ago but looking at those fluid movements shows that he fundamentally has no problem at all is this some kind of terrifying anti-gravity design at that moment the technician added the analysis results of the flight trajectory have just come in y wve executed High difficulty Maneuvers while drawing a picture in the sky Victor inquired drawing what pull the lens backs so we could see what he is drawing yiu continued to sketch a hand raising the middle finger this made Victor Furious he shouted damn it he did all those moves just to flip someone off as he spoke he slammed his hand down on the table this kid is too arrogant although I have no idea where he got a high-tech aircraft if he thinks he can use it to provoke the east region he is completely mistaken Victor immediately ordered to increase increased the speed of building the Fortress right now he hated nothing more than to blow that kiddo to Smither Victor thought to himself just wait and see kid you will pay for your arrogance meanwhile Yu was checking the aircrafts features while also taking the opportunity to provoke the east region a little thinking to himself it's time to get down to business now half a day later they finally arrived at their destination XA Chen was still sound asleep at that moment Yu called out Uncle it's time to wake up after everyone had disembarked sha Chen yawn and said a uncle I really am getting old just a little while and I fell asleep not like you young ones Yu replied come on I think uncle is just resting and recuperating sha Chen then jumped to the ground saw the door leading to the dungeon ahead and asked is that the destination of this trip yum answered exactly how was it was nanana's aircraft comt ble to sit in XO Chen happily replied not bad not bad it's rare to be able to take a good nap on an aircraft I really need to properly apologize to that girl when we get back haaha aulu then spoke up no matter how difficult the maneuver is there is not the slightest Ripple in this world it is unlikely to find a second aircraft as formidable as this one however the main reason is still that y Wu has exceptional flying skills which I have recognized long ago hearing sulu's words both yin huan and Kai exe were extremely shocked Yin huan thought to herself so Tulu has flown with Yu before I thought we were all here for the first time this woman is too cunning scheming behind our backs kakai then said vwo why didn't you take kexi along before kayaki was unhappy and kept snorting the two suddenly sued and looked at Yu with very scary expression seeing this shoen came over to tease y Wu although I was prepared but the Sha feel of your Kido came surprisingly fast just got into the dungeon and even before we could settle in it was already set up y woo feeling embarrassed said Uncle please don't laugh at me anymore it's time to go to the dungeon letun go as he spoke Yi Wu hurriedly stepped into the dungeon to avoid the topic Yin hen thought to herself hemp letting him Escape again in the end the five of them stepped inside when they saw the scene before them they were all very surprised exclaiming is this paradise information about the dungeon the realm of Fallen Angels is proposed with levels ranging from 150 to 250 after the yiu group entered they found that this dungeon contained Fallen Angels Kix pointed ahead and said look they have wings could they be Angels Yin muan replied the dunge dungon is an extremely rare mythical setting the enemies ahead are definitely not simple Yu looked at the castle in front and thought is it the Heavenly realm again I wonder if this place is related to the Divine domain the realm of the Gods at least I can feel it a strange Aura emanates from that castle Xin immediately asked Yu do you feel it too yiu replied yes but since we are here we can't go back empty-handed everyone be careful we will continue to explore Suddenly at that moment the dungeon's gate disappeared sunlu exclaimed oh it's closed the dungeon has vanished everyone be careful as soon as the door disappeared the dungeon system immediately announced from now on missions for players will be assigned please explore the entire Fallen Angel realm dungeon try to collect enough key Clues help the fallen angels defeat the light Angels only after completing the above Mission can the traditional G of the dungeon be opened otherwise players will be permanently trapped in the dungeon immediately assign players the identity of a level one Fallen Angel as soon as the announcement of the uncle's conclusion was made everyone was downgraded to the lowest level and was gifted a pair of black wings along with a Halo oh and there was also the Fallen Angel job title this left everyone in a state of confusion kixi also sprouted wings but they emitted a dazzling light as if it were an energy that could not be touched touched y Wu thought to himself the Fallen Angel here indeed reveals an unsettling Aura we must remain Vigilant Sulu then said this is our first time encountering a dungeon that forcibly changes job classes it's somewhat interesting but if it means we have to assist the Fallen Angel does that mean we are to become the villains Yu steadied his mind and replied everyone still lacks information we shouldn't rush to conclusions we have encountered too many scenarios of black and white Cuts before it's not the first time we just need to follow the dungeon's requirements which doesn't contradict our goal of searching for Mo way at the very least it will help restore the traditional portal Sulu nodded ensuring a way out and said that makes sense I'll follow your lead as he spoke Yi Wu took the lead and flew towards the castle everyone followed behind but kayak's eyes seem to be struggling to take off oh no These Wings are really hard to use I can't maintain my balance xulu flew over to graer hand and said the quality of this Level One Wing is a bit lacking once you reach a higher level it will be better if you can't maintain your balance then hold my hand kayaki said thank you sister Sulu after a while Yin Juan spoke up li woo look down there I always feel that this land seems a bit dark and Eerie it seems that it's not just simple pollution you should tell everyone to go down and remain Vigilant as she spoke y wo dashed down quickly to check and immediately froze in horror at the sight before him it was unexpectedly the corpse of a fallen angel an incredibly gruesome scene beneath the ground blood flowed like a river corpses were piled up and the air was thick with the smell of Decay this made kayak unable to Bear it she immediately covered her eyes and shouted too too terrifying Yu flew over to support kaixi while also warning everyone be careful keep away from these corpses Yin huan said it seems the battle situation was quite tragic we cannot underestimate the enemy Sulu added now we start to understand why we had to play the role of Fallen Angels suddenly a weak Cry for Help rang out Help Me XO Chan heard it and said vwoo it seems there are still survivors over there ye Wu volunteered everyone step back I will go check it out after speaking yiu immediately flew to the source of the sound then grabbed the movie armarm and pulled the person out from the pile of corpses after holding him tightly yiu placed him on a rock and said all right you're safe now thank you looking at his frail and emaciated body with tattered arms but as the sunlight Shone down he gradually began to recover Yu was surprised to realize is his body recovering quickly thanks to the effect of sunlight once fully recovered the person stood up and said to ywu I finally recovered thank you for saving me at this moment he took a closer look at everyone's levels and exclaimed in Surprise looking closely I see that you are all level one little guys yet you survived that great battle your health is really good Yu replied no we just arrived hearing this the person panicked and exclaimed no you are not Fallen Angels you are humans yiu was also surprised that he knew this and asked do you know our identity have you met other humans before the person suddenly became emotional and said it's not just meeting I used to be a human everyone was extremely shocked to hear this he continued speaking when I was still a human I accidentally wandered into this Dungeon Because I could not complete my mission I was imprisoned here I don't remember how long it's been perhaps over a 100 years I have forgotten that that was once human the longer the time the more I became like a fallen angel ye W immediately asked Fallen Angel a mythological stories fallen angels are usually villains with the intention of disrupting the order of heaven or destroying the world why does this dungeon designed conditions to assist the villains in winning he responded do you really believe in those fabricated Legends don't be fooled the ones in the city of the Angels today are not the native inhabitants of this place they are just a bunch of evil beings that fell from the sky taking over the nests of the birds the doves took over the nests while the guests were the ones who drove out the native people who once resided in the city of the Angels but this is a long story over a long period he had transformed into a fallen angel and his Consciousness became connected to the collective consciousness of the fallen angels that is why he knew the true history he continued to recount one day a group of glowing tentacles suddenly appeared invading the city of the Angels these monsters were extremely powerful the Angels rose up to resist but still could not match them suffering countless casualties in the end they could only be forced to leave the city of the Angels he continued after the control of the city of the Angels was usurped the Angels lost their source of light power and became the ugly Fallen Angels only able to wield the Fallen dark Forces those tentacled monsters transformed into light Angels openly replacing and occupying the city of the Angels ye Wu then added after that the Fallen Angels must have attempted to resist but failed right he replied that's correct the Fallen Angels once rose up in Rebellion even nearly regaining the center of the city of the Angels but when the saraf appeared on the battlefield the battle changed immediately the power of the Angels is divided into nine ranks and the Sara is the highest rank and strongest the Fallen Angels after their fall could no longer use light power and therefore fell into a disadvantage facing the attacks of the grand Archangel they could no longer muster the strength to resist this is the strongest ability of those monsters the ability to fully replicate the rank skills and appearance of the targets however only the leader among the monsters can achieve perfect replication the other subordinates can only replicate the appearance and part of the power otherwise they become difficult to deal with with the joining of the arch angel in the battlefield the result was set in stone the Fallen Angel soldiers were wiped out countless casualties the scene that remained was a dark and gloomy land created by the corpses of the Fallen Angels which is the remains of that terrifying Great War hearing this Yin huan was startled and said perfect replication not only can level the playing field but more crucially it will create internal suspicion Fallen Angel is very likely the reason why my Fang feels that this enemy is incredibly difficult to deal with just one slip up and they will strike immediately kaiak seemed quite fearful and asked so can we still get out of here XO chin then asked him is there any way to recognize this replication ability for example using tools or skills he shook his head helplessly saying it's useless those beings are like life forms from a higher dimensional space we are simply not on the same level so we can't even talk about replication and restoration ywu suddenly remembered when he was in the dungeon of that race previously when they were in the dungeon of the monster's Nest they also encountered a similar situation at that time it was indeed very dangerous the whole group was trapped in a spiritual illusion and only y woo relying on the upgrade system of the wit card could defeat it however that time was just an illusion this time they were in reality and Yu knew he had to find a way to prevent the indistinguishable true false situation from occurring after thinking for a moment Yu took out the picture of my and asked him by the way have you seen this person he must have been to this dungeon as well he replied I can't remember clearly I've been in this dungeon for too long occasionally some humans come in but either they die or they are assimilated into Fallen Angels the person in the picture probably meant a similar fate Yu thought to himself muw must still be alive but right now there are no other cles lose I must complete the main quest first and then I can search for him thinking this Yi Wu flew straight to the location of the city of the angels and said let's go we need to meet this fake light Angel for a bit xoan followed behind advising proceed with caution at the city of the Angels the Fallen Angels were still fiercely battling the fake angels but the situation didn't look very optimistic the group of Fallen Angels was quickly being wiped out leaving only a a few captives a third level Fallen Angel was slaying other Fallen Angels while exclaiming why do you need to resist uselessly like this your duty as low-level beings like you is to be eliminated by us you immediately he seized a very young Angel tightly gripping the boy's head lifting him up and asked do you think this way the boy despite being squeezed tightly showed no signs of fear he bravely shouted if you want to kill then kill we will fight to the end the angel was tightly bound unable to Bear the scene before him he shouted let him go if you want to kill someone kill me the boy continued to struggle saying Captain don't worry about me just run away the false Angel replied such friendship is truly touching very well you can take your good friend and go as he spoke he pulled the boy in front of Captain Fallen Angel then he acted ruthlessly laughing loudly and saying hahaha fool do you really think you have the right to bargain with me I already said your fate can only end in death at our hands the captain could no longer endure it immediately exploding with power breaking the chains and shouting you bastard I will kill you instinctively he drove his sword and charged at the false Angel roaring die monster no matter how resilient Captain Fallen Angel was in the face of absolute power all resilience became meaningless with just a few light sword strokes The False Angel sent the captain on his way along with the boy with no Miracles occurring the false Angel spoke as he burned the captain's body with light making it vanish into nothingness then he turned and walked inside ordering you are just a pile of worthless corpses kill them all Fallen Angel has been captured throw them all down leave no one behind the subordinate shouted yes my Lord immediately the sounds of desperate screams echoed and he gleefully remarked truly a melodious sound of lamentation how wonderful it is too bad I can't sit here to enjoy it slowly although he had not laughed for long suddenly a familiar voice rang out my Lord save me he was startled recognizing the voice and turned around only to see his subordinates completely annihilated by Yu he asked in astonishment who are you Yu slung his sword over his shoulder stepping on the corpse of the subordinate coldly declaring no need to ask I am Fallen Angel and I am also the one who wants your life seeing his men wiped out the commander showed no signs of panic only a disdainful attitude you claimed to be fallen angel then why are all of them dead could it be that you sent a few first class rubbish to their deaths he noticed the old Fallen Angel standing behind XA Chan and pointed continuing so it's you old man Ty f aren't you supposed to be dead if you kill my men don't hide behind the scenes come out here as he spoke he snapped his fingers and immediately many first class Heavenly soldiers soldiers appeared seemingly very strong but in reality they were just a bunch of third class causing tala to panic he fearfully said this is a misunderstanding right I didn't do it taaa thought to himself these kids really don't know the heights of Heaven and the depths of the Earth yet they dare to provoke the Archangel now it's all gone wrong even if I can stop that Archangel these third level angels are not easy opponents like the previous Angels immediately after the commander ordered kill them all spare no one as soon as the order was given the group of angels simultaneously attacked Yu's team in this situation they were not worried at all on the contrary Ty laa held his head and turned to run repeatedly saying I'm sorry but but facing such enemies we have no Hope of Victory I can only leave you all behind to escape and will strive to become stronger to avenge you absolutely not letting your sacrifice be in vain he had barely taken a few steps when he heard Yu's voice calling hey where do you think you're running off to taaa suddenly stopped thinking this voice isn't it from the city why is he running around like this he was astonished to see Yu's group easily killing the angels as if they were chickens even Cho Chan felt bored because the Angels were too weak he had thought they were stronger but it turned out to be just like this gin huan also realized this when the angel could not withstand a blow from her that's right just an ordinary monster nothing special at this moment Yin Hanan became more serious she had Frozen the entire group of opponents and shattered them into pieces then she said we cannot be careless and explained in tala's words even the great angel that looks very strong is actually just the lowest level of Angel the true boss level angels have yet to appear at this point tyal was so shocked that his nose began to run his eyes wide open in disbelief he could not believe that an angel could be defeated so easily who on Earth are these young people wait I remember now although when entering this dungeon everyone was aign the title of Fallen Angel level one it does not erase their true strength and rank could it be that here each of them is a Powerhouse of a 100 Stars moreover the young man has not yet made a move clearly he is the one commanding the team so what level is he I don't understand why I feel an unprecedented pressure emanating from him this Commander is a great Angel seems to belong to the spiritual level but is extremely powerful he became Furious thrusting his sword into the ground using all his strength and shouted loudly a bunch of ants dare to stand before me then I will personally intervene to deliver judgment you will suffer punishment as soon as he finished speaking he immediately swung his strongest sword charging straight towards Sulu with incredibly fast speed Sulu thought to herself so fast I can only resist before she could finish her thought yiu appeared blocking his attack and saying you want to kill my teammate but have you consulted me first his speed was so fast that in the blink of an eye he appeared right in front of Yu swing his sword down he coldly laughed and said if you're in such a hurry to meet God then I'll give you a ride part of the way after blocking the attack yiwu immediately flew up high and said your equipment is quite good but do you really think you're an angel if God truly exists the first thing he would do is eliminate monsters like you he immediately flew after her sting his sword and attack while saying it seems you are the strongest among this group of fallen angels as long as I kill you the other are not worth worrying about yugu replied then we'll see if you have the ability to do so and just like that the two continuously fought in midair appearing to be evenly matched Ty laa looked up in astonishment and exclaimed he can actually fight evenly with the great Angel then he turned worryingly to xaan and said are you all going to just stand there and watch aren't you going to help XA Chen remained calm and said there's no need that kid o yiu doesn't even use one one tenen of visibility just stand there and watch the show Kai continuously encouraged ywu y Wu is the strongest take him down taaa was stunned thinking of himself these people are really not worried at all could it be true what they say that ywu really has hidden strength at this moment yiu had played enough he sent to tala thanks for the practice with you now I'm completely familiar with fighting in the air with the wings of the Fallen angel in the upcoming battles I'll be able to handle things naturally thank you hearing Yu's words taaa felt like he was merely a tool for Yu's training and he got angry changing his weapon to a bow and arrow and said do you dare to look down on me then I'll use this move to eliminate you Holy Arrow of forgiveness as he spoke he drew the bow aiming precisely at Yu and shot the arrow with tremendous Force if it were an ordinary Angel they would definitely not be able to withstand this move but this was y woo Who calmly said system switch to the star's main account immediately afterward the arrow struck y wo the attack Unleashed a blinding light and at the center of the light there was only a pair of ways remaining he saw this and was overjoyed laughing loudly haha let's see if you dare to say any more arrogant words these things will be blown away into nothingness Ty laa seeing this panicked and shouted it's over the one named Yu is no more we must flee XA Chen reminded him to be quiet for a moment then said to Yin hoan and the others you all see it right Yin hoan replied of course it must be him kaii exclaimed with excitement y woo y wulu said this Kido truly wants to astonish people even more Ty Lai genuinely did not understand what everyone was talking about so he asked what are you all talking about hearing but not comprehending at all Sulu pointed towards the bright spot and said look closely deep in the center the stars are twinkling immediately after the night sky was illuminated by millions of stars like sparkling jewels on a black cloth gradually revealing the light from the distant Universe forming a breathtaking picture that contained The Mysteries of the cosmos the angel watching this scene was startled and cried out what has happened just a moment ago it was clear and sunny why has it suddenly turned into night Yi Wu immediately showed his brothers the notification system Yin explained this account is too powerful its full potential can cause the entire dungeon to collapse therefore the current ability of the account is limited to 10% and the host can adjust it at any time to deal with this rabble 10% is enough the false Angel was Furious his body shaking as he tried to create an air of mystery sto the pre tense accept your fate you little ant immediately he Unleashed his power breaking all limits of himself and then used his fastest speed to charge upwards swinging his punch at Yu however Yu did not Counterattack merely using his hand to cushion the blow seeing this he broke into a smug villainous smile and then instantly used his Extreme Speed to unleash a series of Rapid punches at yiu but yiu still did not fight back just standing there to endure he continued to use his wings to launch countless sharp feathers at yiu this move created a horrific explosion shaking the entire area a few seconds later the smoke began to clear and Yu's silhouette gradually emerged but he was no longer intact it seemed as though his body was disintegrating little by little seeing this scene the celestial being was greatly amused and laughed loudly haa I thought I was encountering a formidable opponent turns out it's just this you've disappointed me in reality yiu was merely playing around with him mainly to familiarize himself with this new account now yiu was ready to take action his body gradually converging back to its original state seeing this he said do you still want a performance to thank H before you die I must admit you are much more interesting than the other Fallen Celestial beings yiu took on the title of the Stars M commanding the Stars beyond the universe to pierce through the void descending to this place igniting the evil world in the Stellar realm and shattering the dawn immediately countless Stones received orders from Yi Wu and rushed down like rain the system announc star realm Dawn break power limit 10% the signature skill of the Stars M summon World Stones unleashing explosive power since these summoned objects were entities and not composed of magical energy their force was immense capable of directly destroying planets if fully Unleashed thank only 10% of the power was being used hence only Stones were falling otherwise the planet would have truly been destroyed note Stone refers to the remnants of Mur from the space between planets when they enter the atmosphere part of them burns up and the remainder falls to the Earth's surface the explosion was so massive that sha chin and the others had to flee to a safe distance and hide behind a large Rock to avoid danger tdo was extremely panicked clutching his head and exclaiming I can't be dreaming right this must be a dream right after a while the space began to quiet down Yin huan and Sulu peaked out to see if the explosion had stopped yes it's over now Yin huan said this Angel still has 10% of its Health it seems to have some skill taaa struggled to sit up thinking to himself How can there be such terrifying power like this a fallen angel like you is truly a monster I have never heard of this before Yu looked around at the devastation inside just with 10% of its strength it has been able to wreak such destruction Laguna truly lives up to his reputation as a brother at this moment Sho Chan flew over and reminded ywu wo you should control your force a bit don't drag us into this y Wu turned back and said I'm sorry it's my first time using this and I'm not very skilled yet but while the two were talking the angel had time to unleash its trump card Holy Light summoning he shouted loudly indeed you have some skill but don't get too cocky too soon suddenly he summoned six small Angels but it seemed he was not using them to attack y woo but had another purpose from within his body countless tentacles began to spread out wrapping around the angels and draining their energy he completely transformed into a grotesque tentacle monster he then said your luck has come to an end before he could finish speaking numerous strange objects began to appear around him and instantly exploded causing his body to shatter into pieces fragments flying everywhere in an instant his blood volume was reduced to only 0.9% experiencing immense pain damn it how could there be such terrifying power he thought to himself ye who left him a few last drops of blood and asked what are you creatures why do you want to invade the City of Angels Not only was he not afraid but he also so smugly replied on what basis should I tell you you are indeed very powerful frighteningly so but fundamentally you cannot kill me for we are Immortal and indestructible ha is that so yiu responded immediately causing the last or to explode the result was just a pile of minc Flesh taaa witnessing this scene sweated profusely and said what in the world is this technique sha Chen immediately said old man don't just stand there after the fight it's your turn to lead the way suddenly tyala spoke up no it's not over yet because these monsters essentially lack a physical form Cho Chen was startled and asked what do you mean tyoo pointed at the Wisps of smoke rising and explained you see that stream of energy is their true form although these energy bodies cannot attack as long as they parasitize other bodies they can influence the world that is why when they par atiz the angel they can take on their current shape this difficult to resolve characteristic is the reason the Angels were defeated the angels have tried many methods but any attack that strikes at their bodies has no effect and it is impossible to completely destroy them as soon as he finished speaking the Golden Smoke began to enter the body of the sixth angel that he had summoned earlier then immediately rushed into the City and laughed loudly haha we have said it before we are Immortal and indestructible and no tricks can destroy us you are fundamentally no match for us Yu's gaze suddenly flashed with killing intent as he said huh want him Escape in the blink of an eye yiwu seized his neck and tightened his grip he struggled and said it's useless even if you destroy this body I still won't die Yi Wu only needed to think for a moment and his body gradually turned the color of the star realm he panicked and shouted what what are you doing yigu smiled and said it's just an energy body and you dare to claim immortality in front of me don't immediately all of his energy body was absorbed by yiu this move is called star devour with the power to devour planets anything will be sucked into the endless void ultimately turning into star fragments currently this move cannot absorb enemies of equal or higher level than itself holding an energy orb in his hand yiu said do you know why the stars in the Universe can shine forever besides their own energy there is a more important factor they will devour each other the weak will become nutrients for the strong making the Starlight even more brilliant after absorbing the false Angel y Wu logged out of the system account immediately the system announced energy body absorption reach 1% unlocking hidden Mission the birth of the Archangel cane collect energy bodies and evolve to 100% to become the Archangel can ye woo Happ thought to himself another Destiny Mission unlocked the distance to the strongest account is getting closer I wonder how it compares to Star-Lord which one is stronger which one is weaker we are looking forward to it more and more at the same time Shia Chan and the others had also reached level three everyone was very excited saying oh we leveled up our bodies feel much lighter even ta laa who was watching had reached level two he was surprised and said even and I leveled up it has truly been a long time since I felt such a surge of power yiu walked over to everyone and said it seems that killing ordinary monsters is enough to level up how does everyone feel Yin muan replied it doesn't feel particularly special perhaps because our levels are higher than ordinary Fallen Angels Sulu then said according to T laa the leveling mechanism of angels is different from the outside right now we are probably still at the bottom tier of spiritual level three perhaps it will be different when we go higher ta la approached Yu looking ashamed and said um I must apologize to you all I thought you were just low-level adventurers and wanted to leave you behind and run away yiu replied it's nothing these things are quite normal as long as we cooperate well in the future that's all that matters after witnessing the strength of Yu's group Ty laa curiously asked May may I ask can you tell me your true levels when I first entered the dungeon I was only level 50 but you all have completely surpassed what I can comprehend Sulu introduced herself first I am currently at level 200 upon hearing this Ty F was startled level 200 really Joo Chen modestly said Uncle I'm not far behind either kakai then said My Level has always been a question mark But after going through several battles it suddenly showed us over level 100 which is quite strange taaa then turned to yiu and asked what about you what level are you at clearly you are the strongest one here caught off guard by the sudden question Yu felt a bit lost unsure of how to respond my level you say y Wu thought inwardly it has been a while since I've checked my account level system if I review all the experience points I have accumulated and convert them into a level what might I be able to reach the system responded due to the excessive amount of experience points of the host it will take some time to calculate please wait a moment after a while the system announced calculation complete the host can currently reach a maximum level of 500 y Wu was also surprised by his current level about level 500 I never expected that suddenly I have become so powerful he thought for a moment this level might still be a bit modest if I were to say it out loud they would probably be scared thinking this Yu replied I am currently probably around level 200 hearing this XA chin immediately reacted level 200 is just like us right I don't believe it shaen said then walked over and put his arm around Yu's shoulder we've known each other for so long is there really a need to hide anything what is your true level I am very curious yiu smiled and replied if I say it my uncle might have a very good psychological endurance in the end yiu had no choice but to tell the truth about level 500 although sha Chen had prepared himself when he heard Yu say that he was still shocked he exclaimed in panic level 500 immediately he collapsed I thought this Kido would only be a bit over level 300 but I never expected he has completely surpassed my limits TAA fou was also stunned unable to speak in his heart he thought impossible level five 100 could completely crush this dungeon how could someone so young become so powerful gin huan immediately said it is both unexpected and yet expected yiu should indeed be as strong as this kakat joyfully said ywu is the strongest person in the universe she suddenly recalled past events and said looking back at the promise with you it seems like it was a long time ago right now I can only chase after your shadow in Legend the five Great Heroes only reached over level 500 you never expected to have achieved a height similar to theirs XO Chen was so shocked that he nearly lost his mind promptly taking a gulp of wine to regain his composure then said but thinking back it's not surprising everything that happens to you kiddo can be monstrous enough to leave a deep Mark in history but what's level 500 haha what a level 500 too clear already let's have a drink y Wu promptly declined my tolerance for alcohol is not as good as your uncles we can drink together after we get out of the dungeon I promise now let's get back to the main topic Yu then asked taaa I remember you said that Angels had once attacked the central area of the city of the Angels but why is it not as strong today as it was before he immediately replied that is because the leader of the Fallen Angel was seriously injured in that campaign although the has survived he has not yet recovered his strength losing the strongest strateg leader the Fallen Angel has fallen into such a miserable state today if you want to meet the leader I can try to introduce you he continued y Wu thought for a moment and said let me think the leader of the Fallen Angel is not dead this is good news however is withdrawing at this moment the right decision although the reason the master can suppress the opponent's strength it cannot guarantee that the opponent has no hidden tricks left just now y Wu had revealed the ability to Dev power that could break their Resurrection tricks if he were to be discovered leaving with the method of resolving it it would cause great trouble therefore Yu thought to himself I must take advantage of the opponent's moment of inaction and press forward it would be best to resolve this all at once so that won't have to worry later after defeating the fake angels the villains would be eliminated and the mission regarding the Fallen Angel would surely be completed smoothly after thinking for a while yiwu made his decision and announc I have decided we will before he could finish speaking a sudden voice rang out are you the Despicable ones from the holy city everyone was taken back Yu immediately asked is the holy sound coming from within the city TAA trembled in fear stammering this this could it be Yu responded that sound indeed who are you why you hide in this city without showing yourself are you afraid the figure replied this Prov ation is truly tedious How could a deity possibly pay attention to the tiny insects beneath their feet on the contrary you all if you have already killed the guards why not directly attack are you afraid or have you exhausted your feeble strength and realize you cannot break through the city Gates that voice advanced again accompanied by an incredibly strong force causing talaa to fall to the ground Yin Ruan then warned be careful this sound carries magic power taaa broke into a sweat trembling as he said I cannot be mistaken this voice belongs to sraf we have been discovered by him yiu switched to the star's main account and asked him again the door where is the door as soon as he finished speaking yiu immediately used Cosmic spatial attack firing a strike at The City Gate with just a single move The City Gate was shattered leaving only fragments behind Yu stepped onto the room inss nonchalant saying in this city of angles I come and go as I please can you control that the other person upon hearing this fell silent and dared not utter another word XA Chen standing beside him Chu joyfully haha you woo this time you really shut him up that's so cool taaa also rejoiced The City Gate has been destroyed this is great news we should hurry back and report to the leader heu shook his head firmly no I have decided to continue the attack what not only tyel but everyone was incredibly excited by this decision sha chin step forward agreeing I also support this let's take advantage of their weakness we can't let these monsters have time to recover Sulu chimed in exactly I'm all in let's seize this city seeing the spirit of the group Ty laa regained his confidence he thought to himself although it feels a bit Reckless with this group who knows what might happen if it succeeds I might finally be able to lead this damn dungeon the whole group led by Yu surged into the city with High Spirits they Advanced cautiously but everyone within was burning with determination it was thought that within the city there would be many brilliant Angels but on the contrary there was not a single soul Yu said originally this was a holy and Solen City but now it only leaves a sense of Gloom taow was indignant those disgusting monsters fundamentally do not know how to govern after Conquering the city of angles besides Slaughter they do nothing else don't you all feel that this place is too quiet indeed not even a monster is visible could it be that they are all afraid that Yu has escaped at that moment TAA sensed a terrifying Force approaching he warned there is only one enemy here and he is about to arrive what suddenly everything around them shook violently XA Chan exclaimed in panic is it an earthquake Yi Wu quickly replied no something is trying to break through just as Yi Wu finished speaking a massive piece of metal along with chains erupted from beneath their feet pulling the entire group upwards looking further they saw that what had just emerged was the scale of an Angel its size was so enormous that y woo with the others now appear as Tiny dots Yi Wu turned to ask taaa do you know know any details about this enemy the scales rang out with the announcement beginning to weigh the soul as the words finished five Soul orbs appeared on the other side of the scale these orbs weighed much more than the group of ywo causing the scale to tilt immediately to one side raising yws group high up the scales continue to announce the weight of the Soul does not exceed 21 G first judgment not sufficient standard a countdown of 3 minutes Begins the scales sudden moved violently making everyone lose their balance and fall in the chaotic situation yiu found himself in a very dangerous predicament two huge great fruit-like objects from Hulu inexplicably headed straight for his face leaving no way to avoid them Yi Wu could only accept his fate rendered speechless Sulu sat on Yi Wu flustered but then burst into laughter saying oh sorry sorry kayex seeing this scene panicked and shouted do you want to crush y Wu quickly get up gin huan was so enraged that her body trembled but she still tried to keep her composure to speak what I want to remind you is that there are only 2 minutes 16 seconds left on the countdown stay calm we must keep our cool too Chen quickly helped Yi Wu up and then said wait until we get out of this dungeon I have a unique secret technique that I want to quietly teach you Kik say as Nave as ever saw the blood flowing from Yu's nose and asked vwoo why is your face so red Are you seriously injured y Wu hurriedly wiped the blood from his nose and changed the subject this debuff cannot be dispelled we encountered a special mechanism right at the start the soul balance does not take any damage but those in this state cannot leave the weighing platform and also cannot use their skills the effect last for 3 minutes if the time runs out and the tilt of the weighing platform does not change everyone will will fall into an endless Abyss this state cannot be removed there is 1 minute 58 seconds left on the countdown TIAA pointed towards the five orbs of light in the distance and explained these are the powers of the angle of power nelake these Souls correspond to the six of us when the total weight of our souls exceeds 21 G these orbs will resonate with us and disappear as a result the tilt of the weighing platform will change however whether it is Angels or humans the total weight of all the souls is only 21 G it cannot exceed that he said in the past the leader Salah developed a type of secret technique for soul linking this method allows people to link their souls with each other evenly sharing their souls and using this to eliminate each orb of light thus being able to overcome the challenge ye Wu immediately asked can this type of secret technique be effective on us kaaa replied you are now also Fallen Angels it shouldn't be a problem then let's give it a try hearing this Yi Wu decided to cooperate tala quickly used the so linking secret technique with Y wo however at this moment the balance sounded an alarm illegal activity illegal activity this operation will accelerate the tilt of the scale Yu thought to himself have the rules changed if the method of Fallen Angels cannot be executed then we can only find another way to solve it the countdown timer showed only 1 minute and 5 seconds left ywu then took out his siren an original Divine artifact capable of separating and pouring Souls however inside the siren was filled with mixed Souls interspersed with the resentment and Malice of that woman posing a great risk I will go first cannot hesitate any longer yiu decided he immediately transferred the soul of that girl into his own body seeing this bold move the others panicked and Shout Ed why woo what are you doing for the first time y Wu transferred someone else's Soul into his own body and Indescribable pain erupted within him perhaps it was due to the lingering resentment in this Soul ywo shouted angrily Restless Spirit get away from me immediately that resentment dissipated after the soul transmission was complete the system announced the soul is full capable of causing damage to the energy body each time the weight of the Soul exceeds the limit of 1 G the damage increases by 100% a maximum of Three Stacks can be accumulated lasting for 2 hours however if exceeding the third stack it will fall into an abnormal State the soul will continuously exit the body for 1 hour during this time if not returning to the body it will be completely disintegrated choen looked at ywo and frowned kid you always like to do things that scare people to death taaa witnessing the scene exclaimed in astonishment what what kind of God spirit is this it can actually make the soul exceed the highest limit truly unimaginable kaii worriedly ran close to Yu asking vwo are you okay yiu smiled although his body trembled slightly after the weight of the Soul increased he transmitted a portion of the soul to Yin Guan everyone come here yiu sent loudly there will be a moment of great pain but afterwards everything will become comfortable just bear with it a little Yin Ruan received the soul from Yi Wu trembling slightly contrary to expectations she sighed in relief and smiled saying it doesn't hurt at all in fact it's a bit pleasurable gradually everyone received a part of the soul from y wo causing the weight of each person's soul to increased by more than 21 G when everything was completed Yi Wu smiled confidently we did it y wo immediately asked Canen so what can we pass the test Ken replied currently checking conditions met determined to be up to standard angle of power said I didn't expect someone to be able to pass the challenge however this data isn't bad it will surely be used again next time you who stepped off the weighing scale flew down and said next time do you think I will give you this opportunity again after saying that you would use the skill true- wise to locate the target after confirming the position of angle of power yiu Drew true eyes and slashed towards him Yu's strike was so powerful that it could destroy a structure not only forcing angle of power to reveal himself but also taking away 80% of his health however angle of power remained calm and said you were able to find my True Form interesting Yin huan immediately Drew her sword and charged at him stabbing straight towards him angle of power chuckled lightly and said if we don't follow the rules then let you regret not leaving I am the ruler of the Angel's domain now I will turn this entire area into a gigantic Soul maze you will be trapped here forever with that he Unleashed his maze domain ye W saw this and also took out a highlevel labyrinth artifact saying I know you have hidden tricks up your sleeve if that's the case I will use a higher level maze to completely envelop you what you W held in her hand was a Divine gr chaos Labyrinth artifact capable of creating an indestructible maze area those who are not verified by the owner of the artifact if they step inside will be permanently lost within it at this moment the angle of power had been trapped by Yi wo inside the chaos Labyrinth however he showed no signs of worry on the contrary he smiled disdainfully is this little skill all you dare to show before me immediately after he spoke in a serious tone activate all domain Powers begin analyzing the structure recording the calculations in just a moment he quickly found the path that could lead him out of the maze instantly he soared along the Route he had mapped out feeling smugged he shouted haa is this all you've got what is called a Divine gr artifact is only this much however life is not as dreamy as one expects he had only flown for a few seconds when he encountered a wall blocking his path right in front of him with no way out he stood dumbfounded a dead end how can this be his face began to contort in Anger he shouted no way my calculations can absolutely not be wrong what on Earth went wrong he said this maze is definitely hiding something I must investigate it clearly after that he immediately transformed into a form similar to that of a human for easier movement having said that he lunged forward to find a way out however despite trying hundred hundreds of paths he still could not find an exit he murmured not here not here didn't I just pass through here he stopped pondering wait could it be that this maze is not only designed in a 360 de spatial structure but is also continuously changing randomly he began to calculate and realized according to my reasoning every 10 seconds the initial structure of the maze is completely shattered this type of change has no rules at all in the end how many possible calculations can there be despite trying to calculate millions of outcomes he still found no solution losing control he shouted it can't be calculated this maze has no way out his anger erupted and he yelled ah ah if there's no way out I will destroy this space having said that he Unleashed an extremely powerful attack toward the opposite wall but unfortunately it caused no damage at all he gritted his teeth and yelled damn it if so then I will try to break through from above after saying that he flapped his wings hard and flew straight up into the sky the angle of power rose up but just after a mere 10 m he was seized by countless hands pulled back into the Labyrinth like this he plunged head first into the ground completely unable to resist the angle of power screamed helplessly you bastard Labyrinth designs must adhere to basic rules right a labyrinth without an exit what kind of of thing is that don't you have rules to follow Yi Wu projected the image calmly and replied why would I not mention the rules in this Labyrinth my rules are the rules I didn't say anything when I weighed your souls just now if you can't get up after losing then don't play it's really frustrating the angle of power continued to scream in despair forever unable to escape but in reality what was trapped in The Labyrinth was only his Consciousness while his body motionless outside XA Chen curiously asked what happened to him why is he suddenly immobile y Wu coldly replied his Consciousness has been completely trapped in the chaotic Labyrinth and will never awaken again I have accepted his soul as he spoke yeu used the god Spirit syange to extract the soul of the angle of power immediately the system announced congratulations host you have defeated the boss angle of power rewards received experience 10,000 wealth 2 million Divine magic Crystal level x99 the wings of the angle of power have been damaged the once pristine white wings are now tattered Beyond bearing yet still retain a trace of divine power Yu thought to himself perhaps after repairs it can still be used this may well be a highlevel alternative version of the Angels wings I wonder what special effects it will bring after restoration next there was a rather strange item a mask made of metal the origin of the Mask is unclear but at night it seemingly emits Eerie laughter according to the information this mask is suitable for hanging at the entrance of a house to ward off evil if equipped it has the ability to conceal or modify personal information but at the same time it increases others suspicion toward you yiu muttered this bizarre thing is quite interesting then he came across a special music sheet called music sheet of the ashmen it is rumored that this music was composed by the angle of power during a sleepless night while crafting an artifact when used this music can permanently raise energy limits and enhance immunity against fatigue ywu chuckled as he read the lyrics I never expected the angle of power to have such a down to earth side the Pure Heart of an artisan is hidden Within These lyrics in addition he discovered a special piece of jewelry the essence of a master Craftsman's Soul condensed into form this item when equipped can increase the success rate of artifact crafting Yi Wu told himself what I love are my own works the soul scale is an extremely rare artifact of rules it is the most prized work of the angle of power any Soul weighed by him is unlikely to escape however in pursuit of fairness he has left a small flaw which ultimately led to his defeat this artifact has a special effect when used against enemies of a lower rank it can directly destroy the target you can aim up to 100 targets at once but it cannot be used against high level bosses the execution time ranges from 5 to 60 seconds depending on the number of targets after use the cooldown timed at 72 hours angle of power now you are facing an adventurer with a rank exceeding 500 suddenly a strange glowing object appear ahead kexi wondered is there something appearing over there taaa immediately explained that is the mechanism leading to the next four that four belongs to the realm of amula Y Wu curiously asked who is amula what kind of opponent is he taaa replied amula is the warden of the city of angal that prison holds many dangerous prisoners and monsters but the scariest thing is the warden himself he is not like the angle of power who is based on rules IMA is an absolute combatant not only is he skilled in using various forms of powerful evil magic but he also controls the entire prison and the prisoners making them completely obey his commands if you want to challenge amula it is best to prepare everything thoroughly amula said the energy angle of power has disappeared hemp has he lost truly a waste amila looked around and ordered listen to me when the passage opens immediately launch the strongest attack We Must Destroy the Intruder in one go the subordinates responded in chorus understood as the light from the passage appeared amula shouted it's here attack fire at will immediately countless attacks surged toward the passage creating explosions That Shook the heavens and the Earth but when the smoke cleared the position of the passage was vacant with no one appearing a subordinate reported my Lord they did not come at this moment yiu activated the projection smiled faintly and said in the past your boss thought I wanted to leave but no I want go in now as you prepare to Ambush me I want return even more this time I anticipated your intentions thank you for the fireworks amila angrily growled don't be so smug sooner or later you will die at my hands outside tyfa looked at y Wu and asked are you really not going to continue I think you have enough strength for that yiu cly replied no need to rush the angle of power and charge of the domain is no longer here so we don't have to worry about encountering any bizarre rule mechanisms but to prevent the enemy from reclaiming it it's best to let the Fallen Angel manage it for now as for me there are a few things I need to ask the leader of the Fallen Angels Fallen Angel assala level one at this moment in the domain of the Fallen Angels inside the main hall assala was seriously injured and could only prolong her life with the support of machines below the high ranking members of the Fallen Angels were still discussing their next plan a figure in purple attire named kuder spoke up we have suffered too many casualties we couldn't even break through the city Gates what is the meaning of such sacrifices is it just for self-comfort the figure in Black sitting above nodded in agreement kuder is right for now the most important thing is to preserve our strength however a girl with green hair named ailia expressed her disagreement she said up until now we only have one option to fight to the death against those monsters that is the only way to survive anyone who wants to hide like a turtle can go ahead a little girl standing nearby interrupted ailia stop it kuder turned back retorting so do you have any way to kill those monsters even sarra Lord Was Defeated others who go will only die in vain we need to find another way to survive ailia immediately rebuffed fiercely have you cowards fallen so long that your souls have rotted as long as I still breathe the City of Angels must be reclaimed you all can continue to live in fear at this moment assala spoke up what is the situation with the daylight team we sent out a Philly reported my Lord there has been no news at all I also cannot sense their energy kuder then said my Lord it really is impossible to resume the battle we should let go of our hatred and seek other peaceful Solutions ailia opposed what a joke don't tell me you don't know the ruthless tactics of those monsters do you really think that if we surrender they will spare us the person in Black robes asked then do you have a better solution ailia angrily replied dying in battle is far better than being a coward like you while they were arguing fiercely suddenly the main door of the throne Hall opened causing everyone to stop the person who entered was none other than tala along with Y Wu and his group TAA spoke my Lord I'm back kuder seeing TFA looked surprised I thought you were dead who are these people TAA explained they are new friends they saved me let me introduce them to everyone taaa had not finished speaking when kuder interrupted step aside you have no right to speak here wait lord taaa hurriedly said Not only did we breach the gates of the city of angal but we also defeated the angle of power from the first domain hearing say that everyone showed surprise and skepticism ailia immediately spoke up what how can that be today our team sent out was completely annihilated moreover your levels are so low kuder smirked showing disdain you someone who peed their pants at the mere sight of an angel don't brag without a script taaf panicked everything I am saying is true if you don't believe me you can go see for yourselves ye W cut in all right let's not waste words anymore then ye Wu took out the original Divine artifact containing the soul of the angle of power for them to see the light from that Soul left Kutter stunned this this is the sole energy of an Angel moreover looking at the soul and the purity of this energy this is not the energy of an ordinary Angel ailia also realized this and said if my judgment is not wrong this must at least be obtained from a third great Angel could it be that every everything you said is true y Wu directly approached assala seeing this kuder drew his sword in warning stop if you dare to come any closer I will kill you without hesitation yiu turned his head and said I have no malicious intent I just want to give the Lord a gift for our meeting assala then said you all step back let him approach he continued Young Angel I can sense a remarkable power hidden within you what brings you here he W St closer and then asked I want to ask you if you want to return to your Peak a Solis sighed and replied return to my Peak ever since that Great War my body has not been able to recover I can only rely on these devices to barely prolong my life do you Ma away without hesitation y Wu immediately use God's spirit to inject the soul of angel of power into is salah's brain upon witnessing this scene the subordinates lost their composure they swiftly Drew their swords rushed forward and shouted assassin quickly protect Sara Lord it must be another scheme from those monsters slay them at once as soon as affilia charged sha chin immediately drew his sword to block her attack and said are you fallen angels really so stubborn before making a move shouldn't you take a good look first the surra Lord after receiving the soul of the angle of power asala began to absorb the energy of light and transform it into her own energy in a very short time she restored her healthy State her legs regrew as before and five pairs of wings spread wide full of Vitality however since asala was originally a saraf when she absorbed all the energy of the death angel she can only recover to three parts of her power kuder appeared surprised he actually managed to heal the Sur off Lord we couldn't do that even with all our strength ailia exclaimed with joy the sarraf Lord has finally recovered we have hope now the people around them congratulated in unison congratulations to the Sur off Lord for recovering assala still couldn't believe that she had been restored although it was only three parts of her power she had escaped the weaken State thank you yel Angel she said kaluna immediately asked Sara Lord please guide us the future of our entire Clan now relies on you ailia was extremely excited saying sir off Lord please command the attack we will absolutely obey assala heroically shouted we were once the proudest Warriors in the sky but today faced with desperate circumstances I see in your eyes a flood of doubt and fear remember we have not lost everything our strength faith and willpower still remain in the end we will reclaim our home he then turned to ywu saying and you Young Angel if you have any requests feel free to speak as long as it is within my capability I will surely fulfill it yuu replied I have two things first now that the angle of power is dead the first tier of the Angel City is unguarded I hope you can promptly send troops to occupy that place before the enemy can rearrange this can be a foothold for future advances upon hearing this assala commanded kuder you are responsible for this Arrangement yes my Lord kuder responded at this moment y Wu took out the portrait of mu way showed it to asalah and continued the second thing is have you ever seen this man his name is my looking at the picture yiu presented assala suddenly appeared extremely alarmed not only he but his subordinates also turned pale sweating and said that person is not kid why are you looking for him even if you are the benefactor of the Lord it shouldn't be assala immediately interrupted silence it seems there is something complicated in this matter yiu asked in confusion what do you mean assala continued the name mu you mentioned is currently the leader of the false angel in the city of angal the sff of light hearing this like a thunderbolt yiu was extremely shocked and shouted what after hearing that the leader of the Fallen Angels said mu was indeed the saraf of light everyone was surprised sha Chen also exclaimed in shock he is the saraf how can that be a Salah then recounted the time mug way appeared I do not know who mugue really is but the seraf I saw was indeed exactly like the person in the portrait his power was extremely formidable and it was not merely a disguise at that time to cover the retreat of the main Force I fought in with all my might but could not inflict much damage in the end I was utterly defeated and fell from which I could not rise again youu frowned worriedly thinking if what he said is true this saraf even if he is not the real Mo way must have a significant connection to him this situation has become complicated now cha Chen said why do it like this yiu replied no if that's the case it might make more sense yiu continued to ask Uncle do you really think it's him Sho chin smiled whatever that old Matman does I don't find it weird assala asked worriedly you two are indeed acquaintances I wonder how we will fight yeu reassured don't worry about this no matter who saraf really is we will help you return to the City of Angels to thank you for your help we will send a few Elite members to accompany you right now my forces are not fully recovered and I can't accompany you if in the future you gather more Angelic energy could you give it back to me once I recover I'm sure I will become a strong support for you assala finished speaking and suddenly the system announced the choices before you will affect the faction's reputation please be cautious host currently the reputation of the Fallen Angel faction is at a neutral level yiu replied to asalah of course there's no problem then yiu thought to himself the main storyline task that involves helping the Fallen Angels is all related to reputation so why think too much however I shouldn't rely on someone who is only at level 250 as support the system announced the favorability of the Angel faction towards you has increased your current reputation with this faction is at a friendly level after a while outside the main hall the Fallen Angels sawala step out and shouted the sarraf Lord is outside Lord please lead us Yin huan remarked it seems this Fallen Angel is quite well-liked Sulu said to them this world is nothing short of an apocalypse the Fallen Angel is their savior kayak sat quietly thought when the the Fallen Angel appeared in an instant I felt the Despair and sorrow in everyone's Hearts dissipate as if they had been cleansed a Sala approached ywu and asked have you encountered the guardian angel of the second level yiu replied you could say we have assala continued you were able to avoid the evil magic bombardment from him you truly are impressive IAH has actually been dead for a long time and the current impersonator has copied all of his powers his magic power is boundless and he is extremely cunning making him a very difficult entity to deal with he added you are all very strong even potentially stronger than I was in my Prime therefore I have full confidence in you assala suddenly looked at kexi and said however this girl seems a bit upon hearing this kakay sadly replied I truly am very weak I can only support you all assala interrupted no you were the most special I sense that within you exists a colossal magic power but it is restricted by some Force assala took out an item and suddenly said your magic power resonates with the ancient necklace is this really the will of the great deity he looked at the item in his hand his expression full of doubt and continued item information the ancient necklace is broken its status unclear the black sra's necklace has no light still retaining a trace of magic power fluctuations waiting for the next Air the specific effects are unknown after a moment of contemplation asalah handed the item to Yi Wu and said this is the ancient relic of my clan and for a long time we have not found the appropriate hair if it has resonated with this young lady perhaps she can unlock the seal on herself as for my gratitude to you I truly do not know how to repay it I hope this item can be of help to you yiu took the necklace in his hand looked it over and thought to himself the effectiveness information is completely unclear how can I let kakai take such a risk he opened the system and switched to the mosta account to appraise the item the system quickly reported the results item information Divine sarraf glimmering Circle damaged weak fluctuations silent for thousands of years seemingly rejoicing at the appearance of the hair equipment effect specific character gains a large amount of magic power after reading the information ye breathed the sigh of relief and thought it seems there are no side effects he handed the item to Kai XA and gently said kexa this item can truly enhance your power but I want to know what do you really think in your heart can you tell me Kai XI said y wo as long as you can help me I am willing to do anything Yu placed the Halo on kak's head and said you foolish girl such words should not be said casually understand as the ring was a fixed to kx's head a beam of Holy Light Shone down from the sky upon her the Divine SAS holy form was quickly restored and meic completely transformed into a Divine saraf of level 9 with five pairs of white wings and one pair of black wings K joyfully exclaimed so powerful so warm such a force of love and light note the saraf fully restores its strength at level 9 equivalent to level 2,500 but the divine saraf possesses much greater strength at this moment all the Fallen Angels suddenly knelt down in reverence before her and kayi unexpectedly became the junior saraf Lord even at tasala also knelled in respect yiu was astonished and asked what is happening Kai responded in Surprise ha why are even you kneeling assala said the year of the two Pure White Wings and one pair of Dark Wings these are the six pairs of wings of the primordial Divine sacred Celestial Messengers our ancestors the world once faced an extreme crisis the sacred Celestial Messengers born at the dawn of creation sacrificed themselves to save the world the form and spirit were annihilated only the Luminous Celestial messenger was preserved and from then on our Celestial messenger lineage was created by the de for many years no Celestial messenger has ever been able to resonate with it I originally thought that she had merely gained power but unexpectedly she actually became the new Divine sacred Celestial messenger could it be that she is The Reincarnation of the primordial Soul this must be the guidance of the deity how upon hearing this broke out in a cold sweat secretly thinking reincarnated soul that can't be right kexi is clearly a native of the like sustaining dungeon Forest but why is she able to resonate with the Divine Messengers luminous Halo could it be that the sacred Celestial Messengers didn't actually died but merely dispersed then manifested within the dungeons ultimately becoming kayaki but this hypothesis seems a bit insane kexi filled with joy ran to embrace y Wu tightly saying I have become stronger now that means I can help you better yiu looked at kayak her innocent sparkling eyes making him smile he patted her head like he would a younger sister and said of course kayaki is the best kakai beaned with joy shed aside her and rejected even with powers Kai XI will always be K Yin Ruan let out a soft sigh her voice tinged with emotion I'm really happy for her but I can't help feeling a bit envious if only I could be embraced by y w like that she thought to herself that she must find an opportunity to do something similar however Yin holen quickly regained her Focus reminding them time is running out let's go towards the city of angles Yi Wu led the Fallen Angel Army towards the city of angles this time he was determined to eradicate all the false angels and reunite with mu at the city of angles in the second realm the angel sat high above her cold voice echoing still no news from those Intruders a subordinate bowed to reportnone the patrol team sent to the first level detected nothing unusual amila smirked her tone full of disdain it seems they are just bunch of Fallen Angels putting on a show the subordinate immediately flattered her they must have seen the Majesty of the Lord and fled in fear amula sneered derisively then spoke sternly indeed especially that Brack from yesterday I've had my eye on him for a while if he really dares to come here I will be the first to strike him down as soon as he finished speaking a subordinate was instantly pierced through by a beam of attack the male Angel shouted loudly to waren there is an enemy ambush everyone prepare for battle yiu stepped out from the gate smirking as he said the kid you all consider a treasure has come to your doorstep who dares to kill me the maale angel immediately ordered everyone charge leave no one alive kill xia Chen laughed loudly rushing forward come on let's fight to our heart's content Sulu and Yin hu also charged in from behind one on the left and one on the right holding nothing back after a fierce battle only the male Angel remained Yi Wu looked straight at his opponent and asked what's wrong aren't you going to make a move the male Angel chuckled softly figing confidence no need clearly you are the core of this team as long as I defeat you the others are not worth worrying about come on let's solo kid as he spoke he prepared to attack yiu cly replied thank you for valuing me so much but you were ping is not me it is her as soon as Yu finished speaking kayak flew out from the gate upon seeing a high level six winded Angel appear the male Angel was stunned exclaiming in horror a six-winged angel how is that possible I have never heard of any six- winded Angel other than in adura Kai XI stepped straight in front of him pointing her spear at the opponent and said stop it sarra we don't need to fight for a moment a thought suddenly surged in his mind oh what a holy light as if my soul has been purified but immediately he was startled and came back to his senses he quickly distanced himself from kexi thinking to himself she makes me lose my fighting will for a moment this opponent is even harder to deal with than I thought without hesitating any longer amula immediately unleashed the dark oscillation skill creating countless deadly Rays attacking towards Kai XA however these Rays did not disting distinguish between friend and foe causing many of his subordinates to be annihilated my Lord don't let us be hurt innocently one subordinate shouted in panic ailia saw this and reminded hemp with Kai exceed super speed these attacks cannot possibly touch her Sulu standing the side added beautiful Kai XI all attacks have been evaded TAA chuckled lightly no matter how powerful amula is he is still no match for the holy saraf here heing this Ulus showed disdain and replied oh really then let me show you my power saying that he used magic to attack kexa first was isil which restricted her flying speed then he continuously used flame explosion to cause eruptions and finally thunder strike to bombard in Rapid succession kaixi could not avoid these techniques continuously being buried under the pile of magical attacks from her opponent and disappearing the three-fold calamity created a terrifying power to the extent that everyone around could not stand firm the male Angel feeling pleased said no one can survive after facing my Supreme evil magic even if you are a serf you are no exception however as the smoke dissipated Kai XI remained unharmed she was enveloped by radiant Wings seeing this the male Angel exclaimed in horror no harm at all no way such a thing is absolutely impossible kakai slowly opened her six pairs of wings and clasped her hands in prayer oh God please forgive those who are suffering after that she activated the skilled purification blade this was kayak's special ability in the saraf Holy form capable of removing all negative statuses from allies and bringing enemies into a state of compassion this skill lasted for 2 minutes during which the opponent had to face a deep sense of remorse for their sins their fighting Spirit was extinguished and their attack and defense power significantly diminished the Holy Light created by K xai immediately covered the entire second floor the male Angel's subordinates were purified and felt an extraordinarily warm sensation they knelt down tears rolling down their faces choking out please forgive us for our sins please forgive us seeing the scene before him Yu couldn't help but be stunned in his heart he thought what a powerful ability in an instant it has controlled the the entire Battlefield moreover this Force seems to come from the enhancement of the ring that Kay transformed it seems there is still a lot of space to explore the potential is almost Limitless suddenly amula stabbed himself with his own hand he said do you want to control me dreamon yiu side oh what a reckless person immediately amula transformed completely he became a fierce monster roaring in Anger if evil magic is ineffective I will use Primal power tear you apart bite you to pieces smash you all this time Kai XE no longer advised she immediately switched to combat mode pointing her spear at amula and said obsessed and lost then face judgment in an instant a killing array appeared beneath amula binding him tightly amula screamed in horror huh I can't move anymore why why do I feel so terrified inside at this this moment yiu took the original Divine artifact approached him and said it's time to end this after Kai XE and Y wo successfully eliminated the male Celestial everyone was extremely joyful and excited one person exclaimed sister kexa is incredible she managed to take down the boss all by herself truly deserving of the title sarra Lord Ken ran over to Y wo his face filled with delight vwo you did it you really did it yiu smiled and praised kexi truly impressive with you dear I don't even need to lift a finger Kai happily replied so can I get my reward now for example having a child y Wu immediately understood and quickly interrupted stop stop the celestial be are still watching over there kite side then gave ywu a pleading look he sternly said not even a bit of sulking Sulu witnessing the scene smiled and commented I really admire the silly natural personality of sister kxi she makes so many people infatuated with her Yin Wang also agreed indeed that's true but in her heart she felt sad and thought that's right only someone beautiful adorable and strong like kakai deserves to stand beside guwu what about me suddenly the distance between me and him grew wider the lowly Angel looked at Kai XA and excited said kayaki Lord is just too slay shoen sighed and lamented a this kid ailia then asked hey xiaoen do you know what kayaki Lord wanted to say just now I'm a bit curious XA Chen replied what else could it be it must be about wanting to have children after that he secretly thought this kid makes people anxious every day today Uncle will add some fuel to the fire for him XO Chen chuckled softly a on hearing him ailia and the lowly Angel Drew their weapons angrily shouting Shameless what on Earth had sha Chen taught kexi Lord daring to Sully kexi Lord they all must die TAA Fel was taken aback and quickly exclaimed everyone please calm down please calm down shoen took a sip of wine secretly telling himself although I'm just an outsider without the right to comment ye woo exerting influence over the hearts of so many girls is indeed quite pitiful if he doesn't make a decision soon he will surely be punished by Heaven contrary to C Chen's thoughts ye wo immediately changed the subject everyone quickly gather the loot and let's go up to the next floor hearing this sha chin sighed and rubbed his face secretly thinking he will be punished by Heaven congratulations host for defeating five Angels achieving 20 million experience points 2,100 legendary magic crystals and supreme magic Stones The Gems that the Supreme magic evil magic possesses have almost Limitless magic power it is said that there are a total of six Supreme gems in the world with different attributes and if gathered together will achieve ultimate power their features include reducing Mana consumption of spells by 90% increasing strength by 100% and bypassing magic resistance additionally when casting three different attribute spells consecutively within 5 Seconds aeal effect will activate randomly a Divine level spell will be Unleashed and the target whether learn or not as well as the level of everyone will be increased by one level Sulu then said level up again this time she clearly felt her power increasing only kidex ey did not level up she asked but I haven't changed XA chin replied your level in this dungeon is not low it's considered one of the highest levels already gin huan felt very uncomfortable at the moment she looked at her own level and thought not enough still far from enough if I want to stand beside him I have to become stronger after that she went straight to the door leading to the third floor and said this prison isn't comfortable to stay in let's go take advantage of the time to reach the next floor okay let's go yigu walked while secretly thinking why does yin Hanan sing a bit strange isn't my illusion when they arrive at the third floor Yin H breathed the sigh of relief finally out sha Chen stood nearby looked around and said there seems to be some rule in the city of angal that prevents us from flying too high otherwise we wouldn't have to expend energy passing through each door like this we could just fly straight up to the top to find the syf the third area the golden Arena appeared before them in front of them were golden statues all showcasing their muscles in various poses ailia stepped forward bowed and said to kayaki kayaki Lord this place was originally a resting place for the Angels according to current intelligence there may be a Heavenly messenger stationed here you must be careful this heavenly messenger is extremely Sinister many female angels have suffered from his poisonous hand even I almost didn't make it out kxi immediately asked poisonous hand what do you mean by poisonous hand ailia turned her face away shy saying in short you better keep your distance from him later let us handle the fight fighting Yi Wu immediately understood affilia point he thought this style is so obvious XO Chen side isn't this just a self-centered pervert Sulu quickly covered kx's eyes kexi don't look your eyes will get dirty affilia looked at the statues in front of her and shouted angrily damn pervert come outar I will return 10 100 a thousand times the humiliation you have given me the statue spoke up haha waking up after a long sleep so many beautiful women have come to visit could it be that I'm still dreaming if this is a dream please don't let me wake up let me play with these beautiful girls in this dream enjoy the sweet melodic distance yiu drew his sword and coldly said unfortunately this is reality revoke that interesting yet Wicked thought immediately and show yourself otherwise I won't hesitate to turn this Garden into a pile of ruins the statue looked at Yu with disdain huh what the hell are you talking about did I allow you to speak cursed man get out of here as soon as he finished speaking he snapped his fingers immediately y Wu sha Chen and tal laa were transported to another location along with a barrier separating them from kayak's RP sha Chen quickly drew his sword and struck fiercely at the barrier but caused no damage at all he said Force teleportation combined with evil magic this musclebound old man operates beautifully is there a way to break this barrier Yu replied it is quite clear that this is a rule similar to the angle of power this rule only allows fighting among women men cannot intervene the Twisted Angel licked his lips grinning wickedly and shouted the obstacles have disappeared ladies come and play the game of men and women with me before his words were finished he was struck in the head by an attack yinan venting all the frustration and discomfort she felt swung her sword fiercely at his neck grinting her teeth are we done with the nonsense then go to hell Yin muan charged forward launching another Slash from behind the angel used his hand to block thinking to himself that sword Aura is really strong Yin manan's slash caused the Angelic statue to lose 65% of its health and severed one of its arms nevertheless he continued to laugh heartily joyfully saying this girl is really Fierce I like it very much gin Wong thought to himself this statue truly has tough skin and thick flesh I have launched a full force sneak attack combined with the power of the dark special demon sword along with the angel yeah I still couldn't kill it immediately after the other statues charged forward to attack an excited girl exclaimed these girls are so hot everyone let's go the more Fierce the more fun be beautiful lady I'm coming over Sulu swung her sword repeatedly at one Statue and said this one is mine the statue was blocking sulu's stor strikes while thinking this woman is even stronger than the previous one at the same time another statue rushed toward kaixi sinisterly laughing little beauty come on and touch my big muscles kaixi instantly covered her eyes fearfully exclaiming no don't come here immediately the lowly Angel and ailia charged in to support kayaki LLY said with concern kakai Lord's divine power is weakening damn it this bastard is using such despicable tactics ailia also spoke up kxi Lord I'm coming to help you right away the Heavenly angel statue laughed using the skill love beam and said you all can't go anywhere let's enjoy fighting with me to the end the love Bean skill created a mocking effect in the area of Target the opposite sex lasting for 5 minutes preventing them from taking their eyes off the statue ailia shouted in Anger damn it why use such dirty and lowly tricks on the other side Yin huan and Sulu were still coordinating their battle Yin Juan spoke up these statues clearly aren't very strong but fighting back is quite frustrating suu replied if we don't resolve this quickly it will become dangerous let's aim for a swift victory after saying that sunlu used the skill Frozen fall Eternal winter this skill Froze all enemies within a large area causing them to lose 1% of their maximum health for 60 seconds notably this skill's Effectiveness was not reduced against Monsters level 200 and above when all the statues were frozen shulu said to yinan the rest is up to you she thought to herself even though I could eliminate them directly it's good for him to let off some steam in hoan nodded thank you then he immediately activated the improved skilled body of the celestial demon this skill significantly increased his speed and power while also unlocking entirely new skills the effect lasted for 60 seconds Yin huan used the celestial demon shield and no weapon strike charging forward to slash continuously with countless sword strikes the statues instantly shattered turning to dust ailia and the lowly Angel looked at the scene before them both unable to hide their alarm they exclaimed we never expected that in an instant the power of our sisters would be on par with kakai Lord kakai hurried over excitedly saying sisters you are truly amazing Yin hen smiled in response this little matter is nothing much Sulu reassured kxe Don't Be Afraid these dogs are only using despicable tactics to disturb your mind your strength is is sufficient to crush them in an instant Yu stood outside observing and reminding everyone be careful the battle is not over yet this barrier has not been broken as yiu said the shards of the statue that Yin huan had previously sliced began to gather they moved slowly then transformed into a new Statue this was the real boss of this third level the third level transformed statue suddenly flew high up with a roads in its mouth it displayed an elegant demeanor and said what just happened was merely a prologue now let us begin the Second Battle filled with tension and excitement then it shouted loudly stop the nonsense prepare to die gin huan and suu immediately charged forward combining their strength to strike at his back but this time it was different from before the body of the statue man was so hard that both of them were sent flying back by The Recoil the statue man flexed his muscles and laughed hard useless against my solid body your weapons are as thin as a piece of paper Bring It On he Unleashed his special skill field of secret Labyrinth this was a specialized skill of angle of power particularly effective against women once hit by this skill the victims would Abandon All resistance becoming infatuated and unable to resist the Allure of the user immediately the three of them Kaki Yin huan andu fell fell into a dazed state experiencing Illusions before them appeared the image of Yi Wu who smiled and called out beautiful ladies do you wish to spend a spring night with me kaiak sasai did not hesitate and immediately replied I am willing Yin huan trembled with joy softly saying can I can I really Sulu also felt shy but excitedly exclaimed why am I so bold today under the influence of the skill all three slowly walked toward the statue man he looked at them with a satisfied gaze laughing loudly haha hurry up my Beauties a spring night is worth a, gold seeing this scene XA Chan was extremely panicked and anxiously said y woo hurry up and think of a way the girls have been Enchanted this is too dangerous at this moment Yu had switched to the female form of the immortal bald head account and reassured don't worry I will handle them XO chin was taken aback stunned and blurted out no no beautiful who are you the three girls of Yu had been mentally controlled by the statue in this urgent situation yiu immediately changed to female form and rushed in to rescue them he thought bullying women is not a sign of true skill soon after y Wu made them drink a potion to break the state the Mastery level Clarity potion quickly removed all abnormal conditions when they woke up the girls saw Yi Wu in female form and couldn't help but be confused wow ywu turned into a great Beauty y Woo is that you yiu simply replied the explanation would be lengthy in short you all should Retreat I will handle them Sulu thought to herself this look actually seems quite handsome huh yinan immediately spoke up let me continue to fight y woo not everything can rely on you y woo approached gently patted gin guan's head and softly advised be a good girl this time the opponent is too despicable not following the normal rules take good care of yourself Yin wuan blushed her whole body trembling nodded and silently thought clearly I decided not to rely on him anymore but I still feel very happy angle of power was so angry that he trembled bitterly saying I can't believe on witnessing this display of affection right in front of me if it were just a pure love between two girls that would be acceptable but you neither male nor female what exactly do you consider yourself he continued his tone full of disdain my sacred realm can contain opposite gender love same gender love but it cannot accept the transgender person like you after finishing angle of power charged at Yu repeatedly punching him yiu quickly grabbed his fist and calmly replied you are a Dan pervert what right do you have to babble finishing his words ye Wu delivered a powerful kick sending angle of power flying hundreds of meters away the impact with the ground caused dust and debris to scatter everywhere however angle of power still stepped out as if completely unharmed as he walked he coldly laughed not bad strength but unlike those weaklings who only know how to rely on the immortal soul I am a proponent of perfect flesh anything will shatter and crumble before my perfect muscles the statue person had just received a sudden Blow from Iwo a feeling of discomfort surged up to his throat he vomited right on the spot and looked down at his chest discovering a deep imprint in the shape of a fist clearly visible on it stunned he'd exclaimed how is this possible My Immortal body Yu did not hesitate immediately rushing forward coldly replying daring to speak the words Immortal in front of me seeing youu charge the statue person hurriedly activated his do to resist he shouted if you're a woman now then my domain but before he could finish his sentence a punch like a Thunderclap struck directly at his face Yu didn't let the opportunity slip away glaring at his opponent and saying show your true abilities stop with the nonsense the statue person began to worry he realized that this domain was ineffective against G woo after a moment of thought he gritted his teeth and decided to convert all of his magic power into pure muscle strength field of secret Labyrinth activate he roared his muscles bulging his enormous body now much larger he charged at y wo confidently shouting to force me to use this form you should be proud watch me Crush you with pure strength Yi Wu merely smirked slightly in an instant he Unleashed a thousand consecutive punches all aimed directly at Lucian he coldly said stop talking nonsense the muscles of the statue are not just a false facade he took a full Blow from Yi wo but did not die he was merely knocked away and lost some health he thought to himself I've lost I've completely failed in this battle of strength why why do I gradually feel Joy during this process suddenly his expression changed Not only was he not angry but he also appeared extremely delighted the statue charged at Yu filled with affection as if he wanted to embrace his opponent he gently said ah come here hit me trample me torture me this scene shocked ywu greatly he shouted what the hell what is this situation Sulu standing nearby explained with a helpless expression the perverse level of this guy has completely exceeded my imagination Yin muan showed a look of disgust continuing I almost lost to a guy like this xoan covered his eyes and yelled loudly damn it it stings my eyes Yu nodded looking at the Statue and said you quickly eliminate this damn pervert don't let him pollute our Spirits anymore yiu replied somewhat helpless I know I'm also dying to be bothered by him with that yiwu used a super serious punch a lethal blow shattered the entire body of the statue after the body was crushed his energy Essence finally revealed itself ailia exclaimed in panic not good this guy's True Form wants to escape on the contrary he did not run away but charged straight at guu Dan it who wants to run away after being beaten by you I couldn't forget that feeling let me be a part of you saying that the figure slipped straight into gu Wu's body the system then announced kill the statue gain Angel energy the Archangel King Mission progress has been updated y Wu felt utterly disgusted thinking to himself even though I completed the mission why do I feel completely unhappy the system continued to announce congratulations host has gained wealth 8 million experience points 10,000 epic feromon glands these glands emit a mysterious fragrance that has a strong attraction to women while also enhancing certain special abilities of men additionally yiu received legendary grade Golden Triangle briefs although the fabric is very minimal this item still

also use not only does it enhance attractiveness but it also has a powerful enchanting effect in an instant the favorability of the opposite sex will reach its maximum level duration 2 hours cool down 24 hours yiu looked at the items in his hands shook his head and sighed despite the ENT enticing rewards he could not erase the feeling of emptiness in his heart receiving these bizarre items Yu felt surprised he sighed and said what kind of messy and weird things are these clearly they didn't consume any stamina but I feel really tired ailia and the lowly Angel both leveled up and happily announced I leveled up too the level three shackles that have been holding me back for years have finally broken through the lowly angel named miky cheered as she reached level four exclaiming awesome ailia Lord ailia stepped forward patted Yu on the shoulder and smiled appreciatively well done kid you can easily defeat that Twisted pervert your strength makes me acknowledge you Yu scratched his head shilly haha thanks sister suddenly ailia leaned close to Yi Wu and whispered something that left him Frozen if it were you it wouldn't be impossible to hand over kayaki lord to you or both of us would be good too I would be very happy to have a child with a strong person like you Yu broke out in a sweat silently thinking what is this sister saying too open-minded miky heard this her face instantly turning Crimson she awkwardly whispered if if it's not a bother I would also like to yiu quickly interrupted loudly meai be careful the FBI might be knocking at the door Sulu stood by unable to suppress her laugh at the scene before her haha things are getting more and more interesting gin huan showed a look of displeasure and asked what's so interesting about it kakai innocently replied it's wonderful that everyone can be friendly with each other at that moment Sho Chen stepped forward from behind and asked y woo this floor has nothing to do with me what's next should we continue to cultivate the next level of power before y wo could respond strange pattern formations suddenly appeared beneath their feet these patterns created a barrier isolating each person from the surrounding space Yin huan was startled and said this is not good we're trapped Sulu swung her sword at the barrier and said seriously it seems this is the power of some kind of rule it cannot be broken ailia panicked trying to say something but ye W couldn't hear her he looked at her expression and thought she must know something however the sound seemed to be block as well he could only try to read aia's lips just now affilia lips seemed to mention danger and Angels before you woo could think carefully about what those words meant everyone was suddenly transported to another place suddenly a voice rang out y Yun Fe laughed mockingly and asked brother what's going on why are you in a days did you eat too much haha Yu's mother said we can't blame your brother our family hasn't eaten down in such a long time the two kids are really missing out a lot Yu's father smiled and added I have to try harder at that moment Yu had just turned 18 He suddenly felt a sense of emptiness in his heart he told himself it's strange why do I suddenly feel this sense of lack but it's okay as long as the family is still together I have nothing to regret just then a portal suddenly opened the people around panicked screaming and running away the teleportation gate has been activated oh no a magical Beast has appeared in the safe Zone however from the portal it was not a magical Beast that emerged but a terrifying creature slowly approaching yo looking at him and saying finally we meet again the pressure emanating from this person was incredibly frightening making Yu tense up he thought to himself not a magical beast but why does this feeling seem contradictory do I know this person he's very dangerous in another world a small boy named XA Chan 8 years old was struggling with Hunger after many days without food he was nearly exhausted suddenly a voice rang out huh I didn't expect to find a human kid in such a remote place has this little guy not eaten for 10 days a figure slowly approached crouching down to look at XA Chan and asking are you still alive kid XA Chan slowly opened his eyes in front of him was mu way a 37-year-old man he looked at X Chen and said oh I didn't expect you could survive alone deep in this Wilderness your desire to live surpasses my imagination it seems we are destined to meet follow me and I will teach you survival skills in this Apocalypse in a frozen dungeon suu entered a cave she silently thought become stronger I must become stronger even if the boss of this dungeon is far beyond my level I absolutely cannot back down only through fighting can I continue to grow stronger otherwise surviving hold no meaning at that moment Sulu who was only 13 years old Drew her sword and pointed it at the boss shouting loudly Mighty snow goddess I amulu please accept my Challenge on the other side Kai XA was unsure of her age but it seemed like she was the only one in this world why why do I feel this inherent loneliness why is this world only populated by me what am I ultimately born here for suddenly a figure appear appeared kixi exclaimed happily who is that who is there are you in another world at part number nine on Valentine's Day 19-year-old Yan Ruan was sitting on a par bench waiting for someone she silently thought why is my heart racing like this this is the first time in all my 19 years before even when facing strong enemies or the most challenging situations my emotions had never wavered like this so why does it feel this way every time I think of him while Yan Hanan was still pondering suddenly a familiar voice rang out sorry I'm late she looked up joyfully replied no it's okay I'm so glad you came before Yin Hanan now stood Yu the grown virgin of the man she happily ran up close and said why woo I've been waiting for you for so long Yi Wu smiled gently hugged her and said making my beloved wait this long I deserve to be punished how about I spend the whole day with you today what do you think Yin hor suddenly felt anxious inside thinking how strange Yu has never been this proactive before meanwhile in front of yo a strange creature suddenly appeared before him he frowned and coldly asked who are you if I remember correctly the one standing before Yu right now is one of the ancient gods he appears mysterious and says who I am is not important what matters is that you are about to die Yu is startled and exclaims what do you mean trying to threaten me then y w thinks to himself why do I sense a feeling from this person that is both contradictory and intensely oppressive suddenly the ancient God speaks again reflect on this this world was never meant for you if you continue to sink deeper into it even you will forget who you are if you insist on staying we will not hesitate to help you destroy this world Yi Wu feels anxious thinking this person is absolutely dangerous what should I do I only have the strength of level three surely I cannot be his opponent but if I run away that might truly be the end in his confusion yiu suddenly sees Yun Fe Rush forward shouting you must run away the ancient god snears his voice dripping with sarcasm what a touching performance it's just a Pity that it is all in vain saying that he reaches out and tightly grasps yanf seeing this yiu panics and shouts lever go your target is me right don't harm my family the ancient god tightened his grip on yun's neck and said then prove it to me with your actions just how far can a level three ways truly go yiu immediately drew his sword and shouted I told you to stop damn it go to hell immediately afterward ywu swung his sword at the ancient god rescuing yanf the ancient God suddenly smiled with satisfaction and said that's right this is who you truly are as soon as he finished speaking the space around them unexpectedly shattered into pieces yiu exclaimed in astonishment is the space collapsing memories rushed back y Wu held his head his voice lost ah I remember now I was just in the City of Angels but then I was enveloped by a beam of light if it weren't for you I might still be lost in that illusion but why did you help me earlier in the ancient god illusion you clearly wanted to kill me now you come to my rescue what exactly is your purpose the ancient god replied briefly soon you will know after saying that he vanished along with the illusionary space once the space completely collapsed yiwu opened his eyes and discovered he was tightly Shackled not only him but the others were also in a similar predicament Yu thought to them it's not about killing but imprisoning it seems this boss has some rules to follow this time thinking that YW strained himself to break the chains and Escape he then approached yino and said these chains are made of magic power I wonder if they can be destroyed from the outside after speaking yiu swung his sword towards Yin Guan but immediately stopped thinking no I can't attack recklessly without understanding the rules what if I accidentally harm the essence this enemy uses illusions to attack in other words it can only be resolved from within either they find a way to break the illusion themselves or I have to enter their illusion to rescue them but how do I enter someone else's illusion inside Yin Juan's illusion she hugged y Wu and asked I know there's a new pastry shop that just opened do you want to try it Yu replied sure but did you bring the equipment from the last dungeon you fought in Yin Hulan asked back in confusion huh why why are you asking this immediately yiu slapped her in the face causing her to Bow her head yiu shouted loudly what are you pretending to be clueless for yinhuan covered her face tears streaming down her cheeks vwu why did you do this did I do something wrong Yu frowned his voice filled with anger didn't I tell you before you all have to hand over all the loot from this dungeon to me you were the main damage dealer of the team and you will definitely get a good share of the good stuff hand it over to me quickly Yin huan was stunned thinking to herself what is happening y Wu wasn't like this before I have the feeling that something is wrong suddenly Yi Wu changed his attitude he looked gently at Yin Juan his voice calming down baby I'm sorry I got too emotional earlier but Yun FEI is suffering from a terminal illness I have to run around to prepare money for her treatment thinking of this he became anxious to the point of of losing control if you're angry you can hit me I was wrong Yin woman froze suddenly a voice echoed in her heart Yu hasn't changed at all he's still the person I love deeply do I really want to lose him thinking this Yin vuan tightened her grip and silently replied no he's the most important person in my life I absolutely cannot lose him y Wu noticed that Yin huan had been silent for too long and asked why aren't you saying anything are you still angry with me Yin huan smiled her face turning red no it's nothing it's just that I didn't pay attention to your matters this time I got many good things you could take all of it as long as you always stay by my side that's enough a foolish infatuation was evident in Yin Juan's words ladies take note that if you encounter someone like y wo in this story think carefully before continuing with the relationship after a day of relaxed fun yiwu's Doppel ganger pretended to take Yin Juan to a love Hotel he softly said don't go home tonight Yin hu felt tense and stammered this this is too fast I'm not ready yet leading close to Yin Juan's ear Yu's Doppel ganger whispered no need to worry just entrust both your body and spirit to me yinan blushed about to nod when suddenly a voice called out from afar stop how dare you impersonate me take taking advantage of someone else's difficulties you're truly despicable the real Yi Wu appeared bursting into Yin guan's illusion looking at the impostor with anger Yin muan asked in Surprise who is he yiwu's Doppel ganger sneered speaking with disdain I don't know maybe it's just a foolish kiddo who can't stand seeing our happiness so he came to ruin it gin huan said why do I feel that this person is both strange and familiar but I can't remember who they are Yi Wu thought to himself it seems that Yin huan has also Fallen under the spell the perception is distorted so they don't recognize themselves anymore the fake Yi Wu pointed directly at the real Yu's face and shouted get out of my way don't obstruct me from doing serious business otherwise I'll beat you to death first hearing that yiu stepped closer and replied stop talking nonsense he cracked his knuckles looking at the opponent threateningly oh not running away instead you're coming toward me fool it seems you still don't know who I am I am ywo the hero who saved this entire city even the world boss is no match for me just based on you before he could finish his SS he was struck straight in the face by yiu the punch landed like a thunderbolt sending him crashing head first into a trash can yiu coldly stated the name yiu is not something just anyone can use the fake leaping out of the trash can brandished a long sword and thrust it straight towards Yu shouting loudly you want to die but with such clumsy agility he couldn't inflict any harm on yiu with just a slight Sid step yiu easily grabbed his hand and broke it like snapping a dry twig Yi Wu pretended to be in pain and shouted loudly my hand ah then he turned to shout at Yin Juan what are you standing there for hurry up and take action killed him for me Yin huan was confused thinking to herself what is going on why is Yu struggling like this is this still a yo I know within her a voice rang out he is ywo he is in danger right now aren't you going to help him don't you love him the most hearing this yinan shifted into a Battle Stance Drew her sword and charged towards Yi wo forcing him to release his grip Yi woo unexpectedly said Yin Juan he spoke while trying to dodge her attacks without harming her yiu sees the opportunity to run away laughing loudly ha that's right finish him off Yin huan saw that yiu was only dodging and not fighting back and she said in confusion why aren't you fighting back show me your moves ywu thought to himself since the moment I received help from the mysterious being it seems that within the illusion I cannot directly awaken Yin huan I can only use another method to to stir her Consciousness the fake y woo on the other side kept urging what are you doing why does not even a scratch appear on you haven't you eaten enough as the main force of the combat team why are you so weak I hate weak women the most Yin Juan upon hearing this felt a surge of strong emotions am I a weak woman I'm not weak she screamed in her mind her anger Rising die die Yin huan's mind began to spiral into chaos if she did not receive timely help to awaken she would gradually lose her ability to control and sink deep into Illusions Forever at this moment yiu quickly switched his account to the chaien emperor he rushed in at great speed approached the fake Yu and said if you provoke her one more step her mind will lose control surely you were the key to Breaking the situation the fake y wo exclaimed in panic what before he could react yo threw a powerful punch at him hitting while saying now I can hit you without any reservations the fake y woot was severely injured spitting out a mouthful of blood and revealing his true form gin Ruan saw this scene her heart began to panic why is y Wu growing wings what the hell is this wait a minute angel wings my mind is getting more and more confused meanwhile y wo on this side was continuously punching the fake y wo causing him pain fear panic and he screamed stop help don't kill me ha he immediately knelt on the ground begging I was wrong please spare my life I know the eldest Miss of handog grou I can give you many benefits please spare me Yu side thinking this guy he then took out a mirror and said if you consider yourself y woo then don't mind looking at your current appearance to see if there is any point that resembles y wo the person glanced at himself in the mirror panicking and shouted no no this is not me I am ywu the Great Hero saving the sea not this kind of monster immediately yiu swung his sword chopping him into a 100 pieces turning him into a miserable Shadow yinan finally remembered everything collapsed to the ground trembling she cried out I made such a disgraceful mistake again not only did I forget the real y wo but I even Drew my sword against him I I am like this I am unworthy to be by yiwu's side ywu rushed to embrace her gently comforting her it's not your fault it's the enemy who is too deceitful skillfully slipping into the gaps in people's hearts even I almost fell into their trap she choked up but i y Wu wiped the tears from Yin guan's face and warmly said I have never hated you shiau won these words deeply moved gin Guan and in her heart she thought oh God if this is also an illusion please let me sleep forever never to wake up after yiu entered Yin Juan's illusion was rescued and she awoke Yu smiled and said welcome back to the real world Yin muan looked around and then nervously asked um did I do anything weird just now how could you enter the illusion to save me Yu pointed to the ancient godf and said the losery spirit is the specialty of the big eyes with this level of it's just a small matter for me for the first time Yin H was in close contact with the ancient god like this and she exclaim in Surprise is this the ancient god that you manipulated so impressive YW look towards Yin Juan and said seriously next you have to go save the others The Mastermind behind the scenes has not yet revealed himself you must stay vigilant and wait for my return yinan responded but in her heart she felt joy and blush okay she thought to herself so the first person ye who saved was me am I really that important to him even though he is so strong he never thought about abandoning someone as weak as me on the contrary he has always been forgiving and has helped me y woo y woo I will definitely protect you well even if it means sacrificing my life at this moment in Kiki's illusion she saw a figure appear and was delighted rushing over V Woo is that you but the person who appeared was not ywu it was an old friend she had lived with in the dungeon seeing Kiki approach he smiled and said Kai Kei we meet again Kai k exclaimed in Surprise a how is that possible weren't you killed by Yu he looked at her and said in a deep voice what are you talking about in this world there has only ever been you and me after saying that he suddenly hugged Kiki tightly and gently said come here K Kai become my queen and together we will have children isn't that what you have always wanted Kai Kei panicked and pushed him away shouting how absurd get away then she thought to herself only ywo can talk to me like that aval immediately shouted in Anger you rejected me it seems you still retained your composure in the illusion this is unacceptable if you can't be controlled then kill her he immediately summoned countless demon beasts to attack Kiki just at that moment yiu rushed in from outside and shouted you will not succeed then he instantly Unleashed a dark flame storm burning all the demon beasts advancing towards Kikai aval continued to command the demon beasts to charge and yelled it's that Brad again why do you always want to stand in my way as soon as he finished speaking he was immediately smashed to Pieces by hewo as the Mist dissipated rescuing Kik k anxiously asked why woo are you all right Yin Ruan had a somewhat pale face but Yu replied I'm fine just a bit tired some medicine and a little rest will do as Yu was about to take the medicine the system announced energy consumed in the illusion cannot be recovered by medicine only when all Illusions are dispelled can the host recover please take note host ye W thought to himself is that so it seems that this time the boss is truly formidable from the process C of Awakening Yin Ruan and Kiki it can be seen that to escape the illusion two conditions must be fulfilled one is to make them realize that they are in an illusion or to defeat the special person within the illusion that person must be the boss's spiritual form the two forced incursions into the illusion have consumed more of my mental and physical strength than I had anticipated it seems that I must achieve a swift Victory to ensure the safety of all members at that moment within the illusion sunlu was still struggling to fend off the powerful attacks from the ice bone princess the Eternal frost breath created an intensely cold gust of air that caused the surrounding atmosphere to freeze solid Sulu thought to herself so strong the Colossal demonic power seems to freeze even the air itself maintaining my form without falling has exhausted all my strength she then shouted loudly but it is this resilience that is valuable for defeat the icebone princess sneered you do not not know your own limits you are already half dead yet still cling to me truly a source of annoyance it is time to send you off to the underworld finishing her words she immediately shot a spear of ice towards Sulu with extreme speed and force shulu thought to herself I cannot Dodge it can I withstand it head on no I must stop it at that moment Yu appeared just in time slicing the ice spear in half be careful the ice bone princess was in complete panic thinking to herself this dark flame can actually destroy my ice my demonic power is even letting out a whimper after intercepting the attack yiu stepped toward suu and asked Sulu are you all right suu immediately pointed her sword at y Wu and threatened if you come any closer I will hold back that last attack was enough to demonstrate your strength but no matter who you are the ice bone princess is my prey no one can stand in my way yiu silently thought Sulu was deeply entrenched in her Obsession thirsting for power without realizing herself while the two were in conversation the icebone princess had accumulated enough demonic power and Was preparing for her next attack Sulu hurriedly said she's Gathering demonic power again step aside and let me handle it Yu immediately said stop talking nonsense you can't even stand how can you fight right away yiu snatched sulu's shield and rushed forward to defend but unexpectedly this attack from icebone Princess was so cold that it froze both of them at once seeing this scene icebone princess couldn't help but laughed triumphantly and said haha no matter how powerful Your Flames are in the face of the absolute zero cold you can only be frozen into an ice statue but perhaps yiu would disappoint her in an instant yiu used her Flames to shatter the ice causing icebone princess to exclaim in panic what Yu wielded her fire sword and stepped out disappointedly saying I went through so much trouble that counter the elemental properties and this is all I get after that Yi Wu directly charged forward slashing her sword straight at her inflicting serious injuries causing her to fall head first into the ground unconscious yiu then approached raising her sword to deliver the final blow to finish her off but just at that moment susulu rushed out to block Yu's sword leaving Yu extremely confused Yu asked Kulu what are you doing Sulu stood in front of Yu resolutely saying I told you she is my prey you and I are not acquainted why must you interfere in my business she looked at Yu with eyes full of hatred and after speaking she vanished let me regain my strength and I will fight again I must become strong stronger than anyone you cannot destroy everything Yu thought about Kulu in the past surely after this battle she will undergo a transformation and become a true Peete Powerhouse however based on previous experience yiu knew that only by killing the icebone princess could he break free from the control and mental attacks of the boss faking this yiu quickly took action delivering a finishing blow and said I'm sorry we have no other choice seeing this scene Sulu was extremely panicked her eyes whitened as she erupted with killing intent shouting you dare truly kill her unforgivable I will kill you she had lost control her mind in chaos charging forward slashing continuously at Yu at this moment Yu could only Dodge while trying to awaken her suu wake up it's me you woo afterward he thought to himself her spirit has been controlled too deeply it seems that even if I knock her down I cannot help her break free from the bo mental control I must come up with another plan y Wu looked closely and discovered that around Sulu were snowy grats he silently thought could it be like that time with Marilyn where overwhelming emotions created an illusion perhaps I will find a clue in that from the perspective of the snowy gret surrounding Sulu it turns out she is the daughter of a large Clan and at such a young age she has already exhibit a powerful innate fighting talent and the aura of a natural-born expert in a chaotic room the head of the Huang Jen group stood outside the door and said little girl your clan is gone bankrupt if you don't join my team as an underling with your talent perhaps you could quickly earn enough money to help your father pay off his debts sulu's father immediately said Sulu don't listen to him your father will think of a way I will never let you and your mother suffer ye wo silently thought it seems that her clan has been threatened by the Huang Jing group at that moment Zulu stepped forward and said Mr Wang Fu I am willing to follow you her father tried to stop her don't if you do this his plan will succeed sulu's expression darkened thinking father to prolong the glory and future of our clan I must go please believe that I will definitely reclaim everything that belongs to us she'd left for a while and when she returned she discovered that her parents had hanged themselves why did my parents do this why didn't they wait for me I could have become stronger could have destroyed the Hang Jin group and reclaimed our happy life clearly all of that could have been achieved in a very short time but why didn't they wait for me Yu thought to himself so this is the reason she wants to become so powerful although the and she have almost nothing in common their Pursuit is the same we just want our loved ones to be happy and to live together back to the battle Sulu was still frantically attacking Yu attacking while shouting why aren't you fighting back do you look down on me Yu was dodging while trying to awaken her her frenzied attacks truly seemed like a search for self-destruction after a moment of thought yiu immediately used his bare hands to grab sulu's sword and said everything is over now Sulu the Huang Jen group has been destroyed a long time ago you don't need to be stubborn about revenge anymore hearing ye we say that she hugged her head and screamed no it can't be the Hong Jen group can't be easily destroyed like that you must be lying to me Yu patted her on the shoulder and advised I am not deceiving you you can try to remember a little a matter as important as this will surely be etched deeply in your memory Yu thought to himself the psychological attack of the enemy is the deepest Obsession within each person if sulu's obsession is like that perhaps I can awaken her memory suddenly Sulu erupted with intense power Gathering all the ice around her close to herself seeing this Yu worriedly thought is she trying to freeze herself he quickly saidulu you're not trying to escape reality are you I know you're not someone who is shy like that at that moment the space around Kulu unexpectedly shattered and she said I am not escaping I just want to give myself a moment to calm down Yu then asked so have you regained your memory of those fading fragments Sulu broke through the ice surrounding her then flew in front of you woo and said I have fallen deep into the illusion of the enemy again and I am bothering you especially to come and save me it's really too embarrassing Yu reached out his hand toward her joyfully saying there is nothing to be embarrassed about it is the enemy who is too cunning attacking the deepest weaknesses within us welcome back Sulu replied yeah I am back now like that the two of them held hands and step out of the illusion after waking Sulu they held hands and walked out Yu said we're back kaii joyfully ran to hug susulu and exclaimed sister Kulu I'm so glad you're okay Sulu patted Kiki's head smiled and said I made you worry while everyone was rejoicing yiu stood silently in one spot Yin vuan wondered and asked vwu what's wrong with you suddenly Yi Wu collapsed onto the ground causing everyone to panic V woo what's wrong Yu sat on the ground and said it's nothing just the use of ancient God has consumed a lot of mental energy I just need to rest a bit Yin Juan worriedly stepped forward and said don't push yourself too hard Sulu then asked can't the ancient god take us in together he woo got up and replied no you just escaped the illusion your spirits are exhausted the danger is too great just leave it to me hearing this he Kiki felt very sad thinking if only we were stronger y Wu patted her head and comforted her there's no need to worry I am the contract holder of the ancient god how could I not endure rest assured leave it to me the ancient god arrived at XA Chin's place and spoke to Yu Yu mused next it will be uncle's turn based on previous patterns his illusion should also be related to his past perhaps we will get to see that person who knows at this moment in xio Chen's illusion he and mu way were in a cave roasting meat and enjoying their meal heartily while eating and laughing xoan said delicious so delicious seeing this mu way advised eat slowly don't choke there's plenty of meat left Sho chin smiled and replied it's fine it's fine I have a big stomach I can hold it all then he curiously asked Master it has been half a year since you saved me although during this time I have eaten well stay warm and have no worries about clothing and food why haven't you taught me any martial arts didn't you say you wanted to make me strong mu handed him another piece of meat and smiled as he said no rush no rush cultivating martial arts must be done gradually first you need to nourish your body well then you could slowly practice later Cho Chen thought to himself really why do I remember it differently before but who who cares Master wouldn't lie to me enjoying the meat is what matters most thinking for a moment XA Chen continued to eat voraciously without stopping day by day time passed while mu way hunted beasts and killed monsters and Cha Chen stood by cheering Master you are so impressive Master you should also teach me swordsmanship Mo replied you have a master to feed you you eat well and drink well every day isn't that enough why you need to hunt beasts and kill monsters XA chin cheerfully responded wow there will be delicious food again thus day after day sha chin continued to eat until he became as plump as a pig unable to walk F few few master I can't walk anymore I want to rest a bit mu answered all right I will go ahead to see the situation you rest for a while shoen smiled and said thank you master Sho Chen Sat by a tree Corner resting while joyfully saying I wonder what delicious local dish Master will catch today suddenly Yu appeared from the bushes and said is it really good like this XO chin was startled and shouted loudly oh heavens were you Yu stepped out and said who I am is not important what matters is your current situation don't you find it strange mu way has taken you in for so long yet he hasn't taught you anything hasn't let you do anything just raises you like this do you really think it's fine to continue like this look at what you've become can you still say you are the same person you were before he then looked at himself in the puddle and raised his head to say is there a problem I have been orphaned since childhood nearly starving to death Master L saved me without needing any repayment and has always found ways to protect me he is like a father to me right now I feel very happy instead you seem suspicious why do you want to stir up trouble and our relationship before Yu could say anything more Muay immediately appeared slashing with his sword and shouting whoever it is stay away from my disciple yiu dodged his attack and said I didn't expect to meet you this way muai replied knowing my title and still daring to pay attention to my disciple if you kneel down and beg for forgiveness perhaps I might spare your life y Wu immediately switched to the account of the chaien emperor and said ha just a phantom bold enough to speak nonsense but even if it's just a phantom I still have to thank you it's just that to help unle regain his composure faster I can only invite you to leave mui charged forward to attack and said then we'll see if you have the capability XA chin saw two people rushing to fight each other he panicked and shouted stop don't fight anymore no matter how XA chin pleaded the two continued to clash violently yiu received countless attacks from mu way but still said what's wrong is this the level of a legendary hero the sword techniques are not sharp and there is no willpower at all indeed you are just a soulless puppet after saying that Yu threw a punch into mu's stomach then gripped his neck tightly forcefully slamming him down onto the ground causing dirt and rocks to fly everywhere XA Chen hurriedly ran over and shouted Master he that knelt down begging ye woo please don't kill my master I beg you please don't kill him yiu said nothing immediately raising his sword to finish off mu Shadow Yu said I'm sorry XO Chen broke down in tears screaming loudly don't why why did you awaken me I finally received a bit of warmth from my family and now you want to leave me all alone why are you so cold you woo Yu looked surprised and said Uncle so youve always been awake is this really the life you hop for Uncle ah back again returning to reality XA chin was still tightly gripping Yu's shirt his face unusually sad seeing this Yi Wu immediately said I'm sorry after XA Chen recovered from that state everyone rushed over to see what was happening Yin hon asked what happened in the illusion Kai Kai ran over and said everyone don't argue suddenly shoen burst out laughing leaving everyone utterly confused haha he patted Yu on the shoulder and said I'm sorry for making everyone worried don't worry I'm fine the illusion is just a falsehood I'm not that weak Yi Wu could only muster a forc smile but before he could say anything he suddenly collapsed to the ground causing everyone to panic vwoo what's wrong the system notification said due to multiple uses of ancient god to break into the illusion the mental burden of the host has exceeded the limit please take note to rest abnormal State all attributes reduced by 50% last for 10 minutes shoen immediately helped Yi Wu up and asked how are you can you still hold on Sulu anxiously said repeatedly after so many invasions into the illusion I'm afraid Yu's mind has yiu tried to reply I'm still okay perhaps for the upcoming battles I can only rely on everyone to hold the line at that moment a conver ing source of energy appeared from above surprising everyone as they exclaimed everyone look what appears is Archangel Lord Demi from level three he immediately shouted angrily damn it damn it damn it you dare to repeatedly destroy my illusion my illusion was supposed to be perfect absolute art it's all your fault you filthy worm ruining my masterpiece I want to kill you chop you into pieces Crush you into the most useless debris and throw you down the sewer seage of the City of Angels down to Hell as soon as he finished speaking he immediately shot an archangel Ray toward y wo and the others sha chin drew his sword and shouted so you are the bastard behind the scenes Yin Juan angrily charged forward and said you are the one who harmed me nearly unforgivable Sulu also rushed forward and shouted you even said where to find you trly thankful to you for walking right into the Trap Archangel Lord dami panicked and yelled what do you want do do you really want to resist me surely you feel very happy in the illusion sensing the most important pursuit in your life finding the meaning of your existence right Archangel lord coldly said don't you think that the reality itself is the world that makes people feel bored and desperate I am Archangel Lord domet the one who holds emotions and if you give up your resistance I will grant you peace and happiness before he could finish his sentence he was struck in the face by Kiki's attack she was extremely angry her Fury reaching its peak don't talk nonsense a world without y wo is not a world I want your illusion is just a trick if you claim to have the power of emotions then you should understand that right now we have only one emotion and that is anger Sulu shouted angrily monster don't toy with my memories die Yin wuan enraged declared I will regain my strength in the illusion and use your body enjoy this feeling shoen said little sister is right it's time for us to unleash our anger with that the three of them charged together to attack shaen used Crescent Moon slash to strike at his head Yin voan repeatedly thrust the stargaze halard into him while seu employed ice Bone Dance to freeze him in a very short time the Archangel Lord was beaten to Pieces powerless to resist ye wo approached him and said women are truly terrifying when provoked of course men can be too you should use your next life to comprehend this kind of emotion Archangel Lord don't please ye W immediately use the original Divine artifact to extract the soul of the Archangel Lord the system notified that the essence energy of the Archangel Lord had been collected and the progress of the Archangel King Mission reached 60% yiu thought to himself finally it is about to end after the Archangel Lord was defeated the affilia group also escaped from the illusion and woke up Kai k said you all are awake that corrupted Angel has been defeated by us TAA F stood up holding his head and said I dreamed that I became human again returned to the safe Zone reunited with my family and was admired and pursued like a hero if you all hadn't defeated the boss I might have remained in there forever and never woken up ailia looked at y Wu and asked what's wrong with the little cool guy he looks a bit off Kai ke replied because Yu has been going in and out of the Illusions to save us the energy consumed has been too great right now he needs to rest well ailia then stepped forward to hug y wo and said you have sacrificed so much for us I really don't know how to express my gratitude how about repaying with your body the lowly Angel then said I too ye woo not wanting to receive help from the outside immediately clined that is really not necessary suddenly a strange phenomenon appeared in the sky Yin huan exclaimed in Surprise is the sky breaking the part shoen then said this place is the territory of the Archangel Lord it seems we are in a large scale illusion if that guy is dead we should also return to the true reality ailia shouted in panic no this presence is him he is coming seeing her strong reaction ye who questioned him affiliate replied it is the saraf along with the intelligent Archangel and the seated Archangel I didn't expect them to appear at the same time the one leading is the saraf a third tier Saint with an unknown identity the girl with the sword is the intelligent Archangel tyolo a third tier Saint and the girl with the spear is the seated Archangel soonei also a third tier Saint these are likely the three heads of the City of Angels which is why we are so panicked the intelligent Archangel then said even the Archangel Lord has failed it seems that I cannot deny that the threat you pose truly exceeds my expectations but it should stop here the seated Archangel added because next we will not hold back and will completely annihilate you TAA trembled in fear saying we we should run facing Three Holy Arch angels we definitely have no chance of Victory ailia gritted her teeth and shouted damn it I clearly resolve to fight them to the death but why does my soul keep trembling like this standing before the three most powerful archangels here shaan confidently said it's not certain that we have no chance of Victory we also have a Divine being saraf k k sunlu immediately said Kiki leave the saraffe to you we will handle the other two kaii responded I will give it my all yinan looked at Yi Wu thinking these are Chels each possess special abilities defeating them won't be easy but as long as we wait for Yu to recover we will surely win the intelligent Archangel sneered in disdain EMP it's funeral to struggle the seedan Archangel took a defensive stance preparing to attack saying then let's begin the Feast of Slaughter suddenly Yu's voice rang out wait a moment since you can send all three holy Arch Angels at once it seems we do have some standing if you value us so much why don't we try talking a bit to see if there's any way to negotiate y Wu thought to himself my condition is deteriorating and there is only about 3 minutes left I can only extend this for as long as possible the intelligent Archangel immediately realized guu scheme and said do you think I can't see that you are stalling for time you can single-handedly destroy the archangel's gate yet now you are Scar and timid like this it is nothing short of laughable hearing this y wo broke out in a cold sweat thinking damn it have I been seen through no wonder they call him the intelligent Archangel at once ye Wu changed his approach all right it seems that I am doomed this time before I die I have one request could I possibly see the Visage of that saraf upon hearing this the intelligent archangel's eyes turned red and he shouted impudent no one can the saraf then commanded tabola step back what do you want I understand she was somewhat indifferent yet she complied as the saraf removed her mask she spoke with your power you are indeed qualified for this however those who have seen my true appearance are all dead I wonder if you wish to become another exception yugu replied I do not understand what you are saying but since you see me as someone who must die it would not be a loss for you to show me a little right the surf responded ah then as you wish as soon as as saraf finished speaking he removed his mask the mysterious person was none other than mu whom Mi Wu had been searching for all along although they had prepared themselves mentally both of them were still taken back shaen see mu way who had transformed into Sara standing in front of him could not believe his eyes and exclaimed mu way is it really you old man is it really you moai saraf also appeared surprised seeing their astonishment he immediately asked could it be that we knew each other before y Wu quickly interjected we recognize this face but you are not the person we know in his heart he thought ta la once said that saraf has the ability to perfectly replicate not only appearances but also abilities it seems mu Wang must have had contact with saraf in the past maybe even fought against him xiaan feeling extremely agitated said why did you take on the appearance of that old man where is he now have you hidden him away saraf coldly replied the reason I did this is not something you need to know as for him he has been dead for a long time XO chin panicked and shouted what saraf continued that old man does not know the heights of heaven or the depths of Earth and dares to challenge me although he does possess some Talent How could an ordinary Angel possibly defeat me the only outcome for him is death however his techniques and methods of fighting are quite interesting which is why I transformed into his likeness to understand his memories and way of thinking hearing this XA Jen could no longer restrain himself and immediately drove his sword charging forward while shouting Yu attempted to intervene but it was too late sha Chen was instantly struck down to the ground by saraf's spear saraf Bart you disrespectful fool step back y Wu rushed to catch chaoen gently saying it's all right it's all right I am currently filled with strength only wishing to chop that bastard into a 100 pieces sha Chen bellowed leave him to me I have had enough that dog wearing the face of that old man keeps blabbering on seeing XA Chen losing his composure ye W quickly advised do not be too emotional we have not yet witnessed it with our own eyes we cannot confirm that Mo way is dead XO Chan maintained his attack stance saying don't worry I have never lost my composure since leaving that old man it's the same now or rather the flame of Rage in my heart is burning making me more alert than ever Sara also changed into a form resembling a human stepped down and said you are indeed The Ungrateful disciple in mu's memory I give you this opportunity for Revenge none of you are allowed to intervene let me face him oneon-one this is also a good chance to understand the world outside Sho Chen rushed forward to engage and said it's as easy as flipping my hand I thought you would employ even more Despicable tactics AS saraf Slash down he stated dealing with you like this is sufficient in mu's memory your odds of winning a confrontation with him are only 30% and facing a winner like me do you still think you have a chance while speaking saraf utilized mu Way's Divine swordsmanship to attack CH Chan Cho Chan immediately countered with his dusk sword formation and said oh really then why don't we take a closer look observe how I seize the opportunity before me and claim victory interesting with that the two sides collided fiercely evenly matched Yu stood aside observing and thought well done Uncle you truly have been hiding your strength the power you display is definitely not inferior to sraps but if that fellow really can defeat mu way then he must have another trump card hidden away I need to carefully analyze his abilities at that moment moment an attack from the sky Came Crashing Down aimed directly at Yu's position fortunately yiu managed to avoid the danger in time he immediately said suddenly ambushing like this is quite lacking in martial ethics the seated Archangel replied I give you more time although I don't know what your intentions are it's best to kill you as soon as possible to ensure safety Yu thought to himself one more minute I need to buy more time the system announced abnormal status all attributes reduced by 50% 1 minute remaining Yi Wu quickly stepped back and said sorry I'm not interested in you your opponent is them Ki will protect me Yin hun thought to herself this is one of yiu strategies we must coordinate well with him Sulu also thought but we cannot show weakness in front of the enemy the seated Archangel observed the three and calculated the legendary saraf the other two also had some strength indeed they can put up a fight Our Winning odds are 60% Sulu immediately said you've out quite the bravado let me see what I can do the intelligent Archangel charged forward to attack and shouted stop talking nonsense with them just attack directly the seated Archangel replied understood execute the attack order immediately gin huan and solu launched their attack together shouting loudly determined to win quickly to assist y wo T ke from from behind used the blessing of the saraf to enhance their power they thought this attack would pose a significant threat to the seated Archangel but unexpectedly as their strike made contact it was held firmly in midair by a strange wave not only that but the seed Archangel also controlled the ice blocks of Hulu and retaliated against them while the three girls struggled to cope with the seated Archangel the intelligent Archangel had already approached y wo and began attacking haha in indeed you are no longer in good shape this is the opportunity to kill you your teammates can't help you just accept your death the countdown time for Yu was down to 30 seconds 29 28 ywu immediately switched to engineering Master mode using Pandora's secret and switching to flight mode instantly he flew away at super speed to buy more time the intelligent Archangel followed him and said mechanical huh ywu thought to himself in this weakened State he could not use other abilities he can only borrow the engineering master power to extend his time a little longer intelligent Archangel standing behind used the skill of demonic power analysis and said with such a high accuracy system of course it requires demonic power assistance and as long as there is demonic power present its composition can be analyzed and destroyed the system of the armor promptly informed the self-destruction process is about to initiate due to the intense demonic power interference from the robot Yu exclaimed in panic what at this moment the remaining countdown was only 15 seconds 1413 just as there were 12 seconds left Yu's armor suddenly exploded in midair causing him to fall straight to the ground in a terrible situation his health was down to 10% intelligent Archangel stepped closer and said my ability is to analyze all things containing demon IC power no matter what tricks you use I can easily handle it it's over as she spoke she placed the crystal tip against gwu's neck preparing to strike the final blow in this life and death moment Yu suddenly replied calmly yes indeed it's finally over the countdown has 3 2 1 just as the abnormal state was canceled Yi Wu immediately switched to the star's main account unleashing an immense power that shocked intelligent archangel what from within the thick clouds of dust y Wu emerged strongly and said it's time to end this with only 10% of the power of the Stars man ye woo Who completely crushed them after switching accounts to the Stars man the force that y woo Unleashed left intelligent Archangel extremely surprised and panicked is this the power of a single strike that can annihilate the Angelic sea gate you prolonged the time just for this yiu replied congratulations you answered correctly now you can go die as soon as he finished speaking ye Wu unleashed the nebula storm towards intelligent Archangel the power of this skill was so immense that intelligent Archangel felt like a frog sitting in front of a car tire completely unable to resist she panicked and shouted dissolution dissolution failed how is this possible what kind of power is this how can I die here this was not in my predictions with just a single move intelligent Archangel was obliterated into nothingness by ywu on this side yinhuan also sensed Yu's power and turned back to say Vu you have finally recovered seed Archangel said the life signs of tabola have disappeared calculating the winning odds to nearly zero I recommend immediate withdrawal without further Ado the seated Archangel immediately turned around and ran quickly yinan shouted not good she wants to escape but how could she easily get away yiu had long since created an astral gate to block her Escape Route stepping out from the door yiu said want to run did you ask for my permission the seated Archangel panicked and shouted what she quickly converted all her energy into a defensive reflex but her shield in front of Yi Wu was completely like dirt offering no resistance whatsoever without hesitation yiu grabbed her by the stomach with one hand she was terrified and asked why can I escape yiu used his devouring skill to absorb her energy and coldly said still want to transform into energy form to escape not a chance disappear in the power of starbite for me system notification seated R changel has been eliminated Mission progress for our changel King reaches 80% at this moment y Wu suddenly notice something was off he thought to himself strange why wasn't there a system prompt when I I killed the intelligent Arch changeable before moreover it didn't turn into energy form either at that moment a loud explosion occurred on XA Chan's side causing y Wu to turn back in shock exclaiming Uncle XA Chan had completely fallen into a disadvantage with only 15% of his blood left attempting to sit up XO Chen forced a bitter smile and said cough cough damn it I really have recreated all the sword techniques of that old fart clearly before this I was still strong and fierce but in the end I've turned into this this is too embarrassing Yu step forward and said Uncle it's better if you don't overexert yourself I'll take care of this place although XA Chan was unwilling he had no choice but to entrust the matter to ywu saying go ahead teach him a good lesson for me Yu then walked over to sarra he acted surprised and said you killed tabola and intelligent archangel already indeed formidable you are the strongest fallen angel I have ever encountered Yu did not waste words he immediately flew at his fastest speed behind him and attacked in the blink of an eye saying as he struck stop with the nonsense give me your life yet saraf remained calm and easily gripped Yu's hand then said you really are very clever since you entered the City of Angels you have never used this power precisely to guard against my perfect copy right saraf continued it's a Pity that the combat situation has somewhat slipped out of your control and in the end you still had to use that technique once again although he wanted to quickly end the battle it's unfortunate that I have completely replicated it sarraf managed to perfectly replicate not only the appearance skills and power of Yu but with only a differing pair of wings to distinguish their strengths the explosive impact sent Yi Wu flying back but he quickly regained his balance turned to attack and shouted once it has come to this I have nothing left to hold back immediately Yi Wu delivered a straight punch to Sara's face but it only left a scratch on him saraf pointed at y Wu and said taste your own technique his technique was entirely identical to Yo unleashing countless projectiles and explosions in the air the powerful explosion seemed to have inflicted damage on yiwo but no emerging from the blast yiu charge towards saraf declaring this level cannot harm me sarf remained calm and said of course the battle has only just begun let's continue the two fists two immense forces collided with each other generating incredibly powerful shock waves in the air everything around them seemed capable of being destroyed in an instant Xiao Chan said it feels like we are filming a movie Sulu replied there is absolutely no room for us to intervene we can only trust y Wu meanwhile suddenly tal f clutched his head trembling from a severe pain Kai saw this and asked hauh what's wrong with you are you frightened by this intense battle tyo could not speak clearly only stammer uh I I am then suddenly his eyes turned bloodshot and he replied to Kai it's nothing I just remembered something I had forgotten inside his mind the voice of the intelligent Archangel rang out everything is proceeding according to plan as long as Yu knocks down sarraf I can take the opportunity to absorb him of course the prerequisite is that saraf should not be immediately destroyed you need to adure Until the End brother saraf this chance is fleeting analyze the enemy's combat strength once again taaa had been controlled by the intelligent Archangel was the intelligent Archangel the one that Yi Wu had killed earlier the system showed no response and the battle between y wooed saraf continued the two had exchanged blows for over 300 rounds without a Victor seeing this saraf laughed and said haha it seems that if we keep fighting like this we won't reach a conclusion so why don't we each unleash our final ultimate moves yugu replied I was just thinking the same immediately both of them used the astral world breaking dawn technique utilizing 10% of the strength of the star's main they could only generate a mini version of Timeless star to attack each other looking at the momentum both were equally matched and neither was Superior however sarraf with the advantage of the home ground seemed pleased and said indeed our strengths are equal but in this city of angel I am backed by endless demonic power how long can a mere human like you sustain this Yu replied let me tell you something no matter how perfect the counterfeit is it still has a critical flaw which is it cannot renew and upgrade instantly Yu secretly commanded the system to use 30% of the stored experience points to level up the system announced experience transformation complete the current linking level is 35 and yiwu's level in the dungeon has increased to level 10 immediately yiu created four massive Timeless Stars shattering saraf's Timeless star he was utterly horrified unable to believe this and shouted how could your power suddenly becomes so strong no I can't endure this anymore I have to restart the perfect copy but Yu was not foolish enough to give him time to do that he said you are out of chances go to hell with that four rows of energy struck directly at saraf causing him to scream in agony the intelligent Archangel rushed over to saraf thinking to himself it is time seeing this XO chin said hey where do you think you're going at this moment sarf had been beaten to a pulp by yiwu lying on the ground and reverting to his original form he he gasped and unexpectedly said I never expected you to be so powerful I have failed it seems the fate of our tribe has come to an end hearing this yiu stepped forward and asked what are you beings why did you invade this dungeon after all you're about to perish sarraf began to recount the entire story to yiu we are the jester Clan originally living in a place somewhere in the universe coexisting with other races that place was once a paradise where everyone lived peace Y without conflict but one day the sky was suddenly torn apart and terrifying demonic beasts from the void surged out from within the universe ambushing us how City was destroyed and the once magnificent Planet became a hell he continued the survivors have discovered a new rule which is hierarchy killing other beings and collecting old equipment can enhance strength however in order to level up the survivors have started to kill each other in the end except for us all other races were completely annihilated hearing this yiu couldn't help but startle and exclaim wait are you saying this is not earth ool surra replied that's right in mu Way's memories this has been described as such yiu thought to himself the influence of this o game is surprisingly not limited to Earth it has spread throughout the Universe perhaps it can no longer be called Earth but should rather be called the O Universe saraf continued in order to survive we attempted to Traverse a wormhole to find a new home however during the shift we were severely misaligned most tribes were annihilated leaving only a few survivors all have become non-material energy forms with only a handful of experts like us able to retain memory and reason Yu reflected indeed these three High Angels obviously feel different from those I encountered before sarraf went on after that I defeated a man named M way from his mouth the the outside world and treat me greatly he continued therefore I have transformed into his appearance and received the task of leaving the dungon however this way only I can be saved and I always been unable to make a decision driving on my last breath in this isolated world the mission is to help the Fallen Angel return to the City of Angels Yu approached him and said it seems that you are quite miserable too but right now your tribe hardly has any members left so can you leave without worry saraf replied those words are truly piercing but I do not wish to gain your sympathy I only hope that after we vanish there will still be someone who remembers we once existed Yu then said tell me where mu way is maybe I will consider taking you out of the dungeon then he thought to himself I know very little about the universe perhaps he will be very useful if he submits to me suddenly Ty laa rushed over and shouted V woo don't trust him this guy is full of lies y Wu replied taaa rest assured I can make my own judgment do not approach him even if he is Gravely injured you are not his match y wo had not yet had time to intervene when tyala stabbed saraf with one hand and said well that might not be the case saraf recognized The Familiar Aura and exclaimed are you the one behind Yu ywu in a panic asked what are you doing no who are you the intelligent Archangel then said quick reaction but it's too late now after absorbing saraf the intelligent Archangel exploded with power reaching an entirely new level a 100 times stronger than the original saraf the overwhelming pressure made gu Wu who was nearby feel as though he could hardly bear it ta laa transformed into the saraffe of hundred wisdoms and said the vast Force opens the door to Ultimate wisdom the essence of all things in the world becomes clear in my eyes I am the newly born saraf of hundred wisdoms witness my power my intellect and kneel before me oh Mortals I shall become the new Lord of this universe seeing this scene Sulu panicked and shouted why why did TAA become the intelligent Archangel XO Chen said could it be that he is the true form of the intelligent Archangel having concealed himself Among Us and deceive D us step by step the dungeon system suddenly emitted a warning notification due to a breakthrough Factor the difficulty of the dungeon has significantly increased requiring players to reach level 350 or higher everyone panicked what after absorbing saraf has his power surged to this extent Sulu worriedly said this is terrifying the aura he exudes is truly frightening Yu you must be careful Yu calmly replied TAA fa no sarra of 100 wisdoms have you been planning this from the beginning taaa smugly laughed haha that's right to celebrate my becoming a true God I will use you as a sacrifice as soon as he finished speaking he Unleashed a powerful attack towards ywu ywu immediately soared into the air to evade it and said is it really necessary to use such a powerful move right from the start TAA fered what you call a powerful move the spectacular parts are still to come while speaking he conjured countless chains to bind guu alongside a barage of Swords aiming straight at him the Supreme wisdom will structure the stairway leading to Victory extreme power will supress all rebellious Wills disperse the myth of Destruction in an instant Yu was pierced by countless swords Yi Wu immediately braced himself shattering all the chains and broken swords he then used the move nebula storm and shouted loudly give it a taste however the other man also used the exact same technique as y woo and smugly said haha I know this move too just like that the two of them fought fiercely in the air the crowd below could only gasp in astonishment and exclaim their powers are equal and even y Wu is at a disadvantage no matter how yiu attacked his opponent was always able to counter him perfectly Cho Chan said he has a shown his true ability yet but I suspect the same goes for the opponent this battle is unpredictable indeed every move you woo Unleashed was met with a Flawless counter from the other this made it incredibly difficult for Yu sarra of 100 wisdoms gleefully proclaimed useless useless useless your attacks are all seen through by me yiu yelled stop being so smug you schemed for so long do you only intend to seize the perfect copy of saraf your entire plan is dead what's the meaning in doing this he immediately said The more Supreme intelligence I possess the more I feel that space and time become too trivial what can the foolish clan members be considered everything I do is just to wait for someone like you to appear the strong youth is the vessel to hold my Supreme intelligence but why is it that I can understand everything yet I cannot see for your Origins who on Earth are you ye wo then asked back what do you mean he continued there must be some flaw in my calculations that's right hand over the celestial energy in your hands only when I have this energy can I truly become omnipotent and step into the realm of Truth yiu replied don't dream fanciful dreams and then pushed him away forcefully he then said a dead duck quacks loudly so why don't you show your true abilities and fight with me to determine the Victor just like the last time when you defeated saraf you surely still have a trump card hidden yiu pondered and calculated silently this person was indeed a more powerful version of sarra a perfect copy with greater strength plus extremely accurate analytical and predictive abilities if he used experience points to enhance his strength it was very likely that in an instant he would replicate and redo his tactics in a way that ywu could not anticipate he thought further to defeat him I must definitely use an unexpected move moreover there is only one chance indeed is that the only move I can use fine as you wish I shall show you a glimpse of my true power Yu prepared to unleash his trump card an intelligent Archangel was extremely pleased saying so you finally made your decision you truly are a master of concealment throughout the journey I have repeatedly wanted to probe into your background I even used the illusionary power of the Archangel but only saw a mind full of infatuation a stubborn individual a pitiful person the most crucial point point is that you have not revealed any information to me therefore I am truly looking forward to what you will bring to me when you reach your limit Yu coldly replied you will know soon enough he silently calculated in his heart hemp the reason for your dramatic increase in strength I have already analyzed clearly you have taken advantage of some means to store experience points and Ed them powerfully although perfect copy is only affected when the opponent is within sight I have firmly concentrated your aura no matter how you react in front of my absolute intelligence everything is useless after y Wu finished his preparations he said to the sarraf of hundred wisdoms let me show you what a surprise truly is then yeu secretly ordered remove a count restrictions the sarraf of hundred wisdoms thought that yiu would rush in to fight as usual but unexpectedly yiu vanished strangely before his eyes causing him to exclaim in astonishment he's disappeared why can't I sense his Aura the space around me has suddenly vanished as well what I'm seeing now is a vast Universe of innumerable Stars Space Magic what benefit is there in changing to another space Yu suddenly appeared in a gigantic form saying no you are mistaken this is not Space Magic my body is the cosmos Yu's current state was the Stars man Shadow star sky in front of guwu the sarraf of hundred wisdoms looked no no more than a mouse nevertheless he still spoke with bravado confidently saying so you finally revealed yourself huh no matter how you change you cannot Escape my perfect copy after saying this he used the skill perfect copy but it had no effect whatsoever this left him in a state of panic activation failed how could this happen he charged forward swinging his sword towards ywu and shouted don't get too proud die already countless powerful sword strikes were Unleashed but they seemed to chop Into Thin Air completely unable to touch ywu Yu suddenly appeared smirking and said oh are you angry now you are now completely unrelated to the Divine or wisdom the saraf of hundred wisdoms was bewildered still not understanding what was happening all attacks are ineffective yiu rushed in grabbing him and squeezing tightly he continued to use his perfect copy ability and said why why can't I repli at my ability should be perfect Yu replied still not understanding you have the ability to replicate but only as an individual How Could You replicate this vast Essence the saraf of hundred wisdoms was not convinced and used his analysis skill saying don't think that this means Victory then he thought to himself analyze the decryption structure I don't believe you won't have a flaw after finishing the analysis he saw Yu smaller figure amidst his larger form form found you perfect copy starting however before he could replicate the space around him suddenly turned a deep black he was startled and exclaimed what is happening where is he what kind of Illusion is this right after that the ancient gods of yiu appeared one after another in front of him causing him to panic ancient gods why are they appearing here where exactly is this place y Wu coldly replied pitiful being you delude yourself into thinking you have gpsed the truth yet you are utterly unaware of what awaits you beyond the door of Truth it is the abyss despair or destruction facing the overwhelming might of the ancient gods he screamed in fear this this is ancient god Stars destruction how is this possible how can someone simultaneously possess these two extreme Powers no way humans absolutely cannot accomplish this it's impossible before he could say another word the ancient god immediately reached out to grab his neck and squeeze tightly a cold voice echoed you have learned too much he thrashed in panic shouting wait oh it can't be but the pleading could not change the outcome Yu did not hesitate ending him in an instant the final boss had been completely eradicated however due to using too much power simultaneously Yu felt a bit exhausted sighed and said indeed a tough opponent but it's finally taken care of looking up at the vast Sky Yu briefly pondered even their Planet had long been destroyed the enemy strength in this universe likely exceeds what we can imagine we must prepare a countermeasure plan soon suddenly the system rang out an alert because the powerful host Has Lifted the restrictions of the Stars man the dungeon is about to collapse please evacuate as soon as possible Yu exclaimed what as the space of the dungeon began to shake violently rocks and debris collaps the sound of cracking echoed everywhere causing everyone to panic one person shouted ah not good yo hurry up and think of a way this space is about to be destroyed Yu was extremely worried his mind immediately spinning considering possible solutions he thought to himself although I knew the consequences early on I didn't expect it to be this serious should I forcibly open a passage to leave here but if I do that this dungeon will be completely destroyed mu wayi and other important Clues will be cut off damn it there's no other way in the end to protect everyone's lives yiu had no choice but to accept the final plan he turned back to announce I will break the barrier of space everyone gather close to me just at that moment a voice suddenly rang out Cold Yet full of authority there is no need to do that Yu was startled and turned back his gaze directed towards the source of the voice in the distance a strange beam of light was shining the light became clearer carrying a mysterious power yiu suddenly recognized it and exclaimed it's a fragment of the world Stone the light from the fragment of the world Stone Shone wherever it touched and the space in that area was instantly repaired Yin Wong exclaimed joyfully the spatial Rift is gradually being repaired we're saved however at this moment XA Chan only focused on the person wielding the stone he sensed a familiar Aura his eyes filled with surprise as he muttered this kind of magic could it be soon after a man stepped out with the stone in hand and said it was a close call but I managed to arrive just in time XA chin was astonished almost unable to believe his eyes exclaiming you you are mu way this was indeed the real muo way his rank unclear he walked over to yiu and the others smiling as he said young talents being able to break the imprisonment of saraf and rescue me you are truly remarkable Sho Chen was still in disbelief exclaiming old man are you really not dead I'm not dreaming am I mui chuckled saying it has been many years since we last met and you haven't changed a bit kid I'm sure you all have many questions for me but this is not the right place to chat please follow me he gestured for everyone to go elsewhere to continue the conversation how however Yu jumped down and shouted wait a minute there's something I haven't finished yet Muay turned back puzzled and asked what is it y Wu cheerfully replied I haven't picked up all of Boss Loot yet just wait a moment after defeating the final boss of the dungeon Yi Wu received a tremendous reward 66.6 6 million experience points 666 million Celestial resources along with rare items including the blueprint for crafting the god tier potion omnicient and omnipotent the fruit of wisdom the light of wisdom the fragment of true knowledge and the prophet spiritual among these the light of wisdom is a special material described as one thought connects to the Divine the moment when a flower of fire appears in the mind symbolizing Eternal Enlightenment this material can be used as a synthesis ingredient for crafting the god tier potion omniscient and omnipotent Yu thought to himself I never expected to received the blueprint and materials for omniscient and omnipotent right here it seems k k and this dungeon must have some special connection next yumu received a special equipment The Forbidden book of Truth this was a magical artifact once used by the saraffe of 100 wisdoms with a surface filled with intricate symbols and formulas that were completely incomprehensible the book possesses the following abilities passive 50% of the damage dealt by magical attacks will be converted into pure damage future prediction a mysterious ability with an unclear mechanism of operation looking at the book Yu thought to himself what kind of cursed artifact is this even a scholar like me can't comprehend it at all and what is this ability future prediction supposed to be the final item was the energy Essence a shining radiant body of energy the system promtly reminded this item can be activated when certain specific conditions are met specific situations please explore on your own y Wu had defeated all the opposing high-ranking angels in the dungeon and received the title of fake Archangel King with the current Mission progress reaching 99% the system announced effect the initial favorability of the Angel race towards you increases by one level your words towards low-ranking angels have a certain degree of coercion after reading the announcement yiu was extremely astonished thinking to himself what the hell is this what does it mean the system immediately explained this dungeon is just the beginning the main mission and the remaining Clues have been interrupted the host needs to explore on their own yiu frowned muttering I thought I could easily unlock the new Sovereign title it seems that this Archangel King is indeed not simple at that moment New Way saw the energy Essence in Yu's hand and he expressed his astonishment saying you got this again yigu asked do you you know its origin Moi nodded if you don't mind try injecting a bit of Angel energy into it y Wu raised an eyebrow slightly hesitant here nevertheless he followed the instructions and injected Angel energy into the energy Essence immediately the energy Essence Shone brightly emitting a small explosion boom in front of Y wo appeared a tiny creature transforming into a mini seraf yiu was astonished exclaiming this is is an angel pet the mini saraf looked at him and asked you are my contract holder right ye Wu replied yes what is your name saraf mini immediately said I do not clearly remember my name as many parts of my memory are lost I only vaguely remember two names Yi Wu and mu way if you are Yi Wu then I must be muai right yiu was surprised and replied wait a minute wait a minute first of all I can affirm that you are not Mo secondly who exactly are you saraf or intelligent Archangel saraf mini responded of course I am saraf more specifically I am the last of the jester Clan transformed into saraf according to the remaining memories my soul has almost been fully absorbed by the intelligent Archangel but then he unexpectedly suffered a severe mental attack which allowed me the chance to separate from his soul upon hearing this yiu was a astonished and exclaimed huh mental attack where did that mental attack come from at this moment saraf mini calmly replied the sparkling Brilliance crackle crackle isn't that a mental attack Yu was sweating mumbling ah maybe that's not it he then thought to himself a mental attack in fact I had vaguely sensed something unusual before but I didn't pay attention at that time could there be some hidden truth in this matter just at that moment sarra mini suddenly transformed into a stream of sparkling light and said the low function body is about to enter a state of hibernation contract holder see you next time Yi Wu thought to himself although I am not sure why saraf has turned into this form for now it probably won't pose a threat next time we meet I might find a way to extract more information about the universe from her Muay suddenly turned to ailia and M saying there's not much time left we have to go now however I ask you two not to follow the two girls immediately showed their displeasure and responded loudly ha why shouldn't we listen to you ha Kai saw the situation and stepped forward to mediate come on the fighting here is over please go and inform the Fallen Angel mui nodded and replied got it we will leave right away a moment later at the chapel located within the City of Angels their group had gathered muai asked his gaze sweeping across the space around is it here the chapel was once the place where the angels of light held Mass conferences and various other activities although it had been abandoned for a long time the Magnificent Splendor of its past still lingered in every detail like a faint trace of History Sho Chen couldn't help but be curious and asked why must we talk here in this dungeon besides the Fallen Angel NPCs there is no one else move we sighed and replied don't always question everything think carefully for yourself Sho chin grumbled inwardly hemp that picky old man is still the same not changed at all suddenly mu way turned his gaze towards a large statue in the room and then asked the group what do you think about this statue XA chin scratched his head looking awkward why are you suddenly asking about this you know I'm not interested in art Sulu carefully observed the statue then spoke if you look closely this statue has a bit of the style of old Earth era sculpture Yin Wong added perhaps this is an ancient sculpture but the dungeon has a space say so it likely isn't entirely unrelated Kai Kai looked delighted oh Kiki can only tell that this is a very beautiful girl at this moment mu way turned to ask Yu what about you what do you think Yu was momentarily taken aback he thought to himself if moo way is asking he must have some hidden intention behind it moreover it's true that this statue gives me a sense of familiarity after pondering for a moment Yu suddenly exclaimed could this be the statue of the Virgin Mary sh Chen upon hearing this added now that you mention it I do have some impression Mary is a religious figure from the old Earth era there are many Legends related to her and the angels YW nodded that's right but I still don't understand understand why she appears here according to the setting of Angels in the dungeon The More Wings someone has the higher their status yet she only has a pair of wings and is woried in this place it really is strange Muay said it's nothing strange because this sculpture is not an angel but a human xio chin then questioned what do you mean old man what have you discovered what is your purpose here mu appeared dissatisfied and replied why are you so impatient are you so anxious that you could eat stinky tofu instead you should learn from yiu and think carefully about where the problem lies mu way was indeed strict with Xiao Chan causing him to recall the bizarre illusions that had appeared in his dreams then mu way continued to explain I don't know if you guys feel this way but this dungeon has always exuded an inexplicable difference from beginning to end whether it's the setting the forces of enemies and allies or the ranking system everything is so tight knit that it's suspicious for example the sculpture before us though it is clearly just a two-winged angel it occupies a central position worshiped by the entire group of angels without anyone questioning it after numerous investigations we have finally reached an astonishing conclusion this dungeon is not a naturally formed era but rather a product of human hands it was constructed as an experimental base intended for some purpose moreover the Angels you encounter in this dungeon are not NPCs or Monsters but artificial beings Yu immediately panicked and loudly asked what this is truly hard to believe but I trust that senior muw would not joke about such matters but who exactly is responsible for this and what is the purpose of creating this dungeon could this be related to the reason you came to this dungeon Mo calmly replied young man have you ever heard of the 333 minutes before the apocalypse ye shook his head and responded I have never heard of it I kindly ask for your guidance Muay began to explain in fact before the Earth underwent the process of olation humanity sent a huge Fleet into space to explore however the entire fleet was ultimately annihilated before dying the fleet commander sent a final message he said he had seen Angels shortly after communication was cut off for 333 minutes and the entire system only received an uninterrupted series of static then the process of olation descended upon the Earth yiu listened attentively unable to hide his astonishment mway continued the truth about the Earth's alization may be related to the angels after many years of traversing countless dungeons for investigation I finally found this clue this is the reason I came to this dungeon but I did not expect that this place would be the Angelic dungeon it seems that someone had known this secret even before me and had even even carried out relevant experiments a long time ago hearing the information from mu way yiu could not hide his excitement thinking to himself no wonder he is a legendary Hunter he has already provided crucial intelligence right from the start combined with the previous information I have realized that the root of everything truly lies in the universe and Earth is just a small corner of the O Universe furthermore I have also discovered the reason behind my title as the fake Archangel King I never expected this dungeon to be fake then where is the true dungeon Archangel King sha chin asked curiously and continued old man weren't you defeated by saraf why do I see you completely unharmed Mo replied what's wrong seeing me healthy and fine are you not satisfied xaan hurriedly answered ah I didn't mean that Mo continued to explain indeed I was reconstructed by his special ability but he couldn't do anything to me he can only impr imprison me within the area inside the City of Angels little did I expect that this would grant me a huge favor the central area of the City of Angels is buried deep underground and that is the secret sanctuary of the Angel tribe where a fragment of a world stone is venerated but in fact even that fragment is artificial y Wu and XO Chen were both extremely surprised and exclaimed in unison what y wo immediately asked so what did you just use to repair to space mu replied it belongs to me on that fake Stone there is fundamentally no energy oscillation at all perhaps when it was used to create the dungeon it exhausted all its energy it's quite pitiful for those angels they have no idea that when they were driven out of the city of the heavens they were merely facing a shattered Stone they want to reclaim their Holy Land but how can they it's just a feudal dream take it and return it to them upon hearing this Kiki asked is that why you let those two go mu replied some truths are too cruel it's better for them not to know it will hurt less Yu asked again if it's related to the world stone and you just mentioned 333 minutes until the apocalypse could it be the restarters doing mu answered that's right and it is very likely the work of the northern great District Yu was quite surprised to hear this the Northern Great District really suu interjected I know that this safe Zone exists but I rarely hear news related to it Yin Wang also added the handm mo group has sent people several times to scout for Intel but without exception all have failed and returned empty-handed to this day we still haven't grasped much information from them mo way continued for decades I have roamed across the continent but I have only entered the Northern Great District once that place is always covered by snow and ice year round with a colossal barrier surrounding the mountain range making it complete isolated from the outside world the people there worshiped the famous goddess Frieza governing through religion and considering other safe zones rical their greatest ideal is to use their belief in the goddess to dominate the entire continent and they are the most steadfast sect in rebuilding it Shen then threw his arm around Yu and said you even ventured to such places were you searching for a way to rebuild the world in the past I really didn't believe your excuses but after meeting ywo I gradually came to understand that this kid might just be the one you were looking for Muay turned his back and said rebuilding I long ago set that matter aside xen shouted what are you saying are you really going to give up isn't that what you've always dreamed of mu replied quietly this world is larger than you can imagine and individual strength ultimately has its limits I have long since moved past the age of idealism today it's better to be a bit more prag itic hearing this shaen fell silent with nothing more to say ye Wu thought to himself indeed I remember the principal mentioning that mu's ideal was to recreate the world but Uncle believes that mu way belongs to the Reconstruction faction it seems that during the time they were separated something must have happened that caused mu Wei to change his mind thinking this yiu smiled to break the tense atmosphere and then said let's put this aside for now I'm very curious why hasn't the Elder and turned into a fallen angel M replied you add me to the party and you all can try to see what the party is like wait a moment after thinking it over y added muw to the party immediately everyone returned to normal their wings disappeared and the hello was gone the Fallen Angel transformation had truly been lifted Yu felt very strange and didn't understand how this was possible Mo then explained the mission requires investigating the entire dungeon and assisting Fallen Angels you all only completed the combat Mission but the exploration Mission remains unfinished however this Mission counts by team with my joining you all can consider it completed Yu heard this and asked in other words Elder you have completed the exploration of this dungeon mui nodded and continued I have explored every corner of this dungeon achieving a 100% exploration rate heu couldn't help but feel admiration thinking no wonder he is a legendary Hunter even the exploration of the map reaches such a level after that he said after leaving the dungeon do you want to come and take a look at our Southwest area it is currently developing rapidly and it would be even better with someone to guide us mu shook her head in immediate refusal thank you for your kindness I have already decided to dedicate the rest of my life to seeking the truth of the world returning to the safe Zone holds no meaning it's time to leave after saying that mu Wei drew a sword and slashed downwards in front of her creating a portal this left everyone in great astonishment the artifact dimensional splitting blade one person exclaimed this sword can freely Traverse the dungeons it not only allows designated access to the dungeons already traversed but also randomly enters new dungeons at that moment a voice sounded from The Sword dimensional artifact has been activated checking the difficulty level of the dungeon 500 levels do you wish to enter 500 levels upon hearing this number everyone couldn't help but Panic XA chin reassured no need to worry this old man also possesses a special God Spirit item that allows his level to automatically synchronize with the level of the dungeon in other words no matter what level it is it will be the same for him hearing this Muay immediately took out the God's spirit item to show everyone and said this is the god God's spirit ring of the king of equality thanks to it I can explore the large dungeons without having to worry about levels however outside the dungeon it will no longer be effective Yu thought to himself no wonder the system reminded me earlier that I couldn't detect new wi's level because it was too high indeed this legendary Hunter is not like Ordinary People after thinking for a moment Yu hurriedly asked finally I would like to ask one thing what is your relationship with muu mu was a bit surprised by the question he replied hearing your tone it seems you know him if I say yes what then but now is not the time to talk I'll think more about it when we meet again having said that mu way immediately entered the next dungeon Sho Chen watched the figure leave looking sad that old man really left just like that it's just hard to part Yi Wu chuckled responding at least we can confirm he is still safe there will be opportunities to meet again in the future suddenly shoan broke down in tears but still tried to argue don't get me wrong I'm not worried about him at all who ywu smiled gently yes yes not worried after a while a salah's group had also arrived at the place they all knelt down paying homage to Yi Wu and kaixi then said in unison thanks to you eliminating the Invaders we can return to the Holy Land from today onward you are our King welcome our new king and queen Kai exclaimed joyfully her voice full of excitement I am your queen he Yu broke out in a cold sweat feeling exasperated the only thought in his mind was this girl must be thinking something bizarre again after mu way left the fake World Stone unexpectedly transformed into a key to the dungeon it seemed that even an artificial dungeon was affected by all transformation y Wu silently thought the artificial Angel and the false Angel King are indeed a perfect match moreover who says fake cannot become real all right let me help you rebuild the City of Angels just at that moment an emergency signal suddenly sounded youu received a call from mokai mohini's voice came through Urgent and full of worry GL woo it's not good the East area is being attacked the situation is very dangerous hurry up the signal was abruptly interrupted and then completely lost Yu shouted in panic Kai Kai looking at Yu's expression at that moment anyone could see he was extremely worried not long ago at the headquarters of hanm Mo group before the incident occurred Mo zun long the father of M and M had a meeting with a distinguished guest from the east region Mr V having traveled such a distance what kind of cooperation are you preparing to bring to us this time Mr hul replied Mr MO is indeed straight to the point so I won't beat around the bush either today the southwest region is developing with great momentum and of course I want to deepen our cooperation and exchanges with you Mo zun long responded we naturally hope to continue our good cooperation but the recent satellite launch in the east region has indeed caused some anxiety Mr H said actually not long ago the highlevel conference in the east region rejected Victor's proposal to continue targeting ywu I I believe that he should be a little subdued these days hearing this Moi couldn't help but burst out laughing haha that bearded man looked so arrogant last time and now hee has to back down at this point Mr who got to the main issue and asked why don't we see y wo m n replied he has some personal matters to attend to if you have any questions I can convey the message on his behalf Mr Hua immediately stood up walked over to MIM and smiled saying oh I've heard early on that the relationship between the young lady and Yu is not ordinary I wonder how far the two of you have developed M na immediately blushed with embarrassment stammering in reply why you please don't tease me anymore meanwhile in the east region the group was continuously monitoring the situation of zun Long's men through satellite surveillance Victor with a serious expression turned to the technician and asked what is the status of the energy Cannon the technician reported super deployment has been completed and the energy charge rate has reached 50% Victor nodded and calmly ordered as expected then fire a shot first to test the power the technician looked a bit anxious and asked again but didn't the senior directors instruct that we should temporarily avoid causing trouble for ywu doing so might before he could finish his sentence Victor frowned clearly displeased and said the leadership only said not to bother y woo when did they say not to touch the southwest region the technicians still hesitated wanting to add but still this method may be excessively Advanced without letting the technician finish Victor suddenly exploded in Anger he grabbed the technician by the collar pulled him close and shouted are you teaching me how to work the technician frightened trembled as he replied hi I dare not please spare me Victor showed no signs of calming down he angrily threw the technician aside and roared it's too bad that kit y isn't here this time let's take the southwest region and those guys zun long as a target for the blood sacrifice immediately after he contacted the shadow Troopers is there any problem black shadow trooper black level 280 replied don't worry I won't fall into the same trap as the shenlong Rangers Victor then said hemp I hope so the ground attack will be handed over to the commander now let's start a 10-second countdown as soon as he finished speaking the power system began the countdown right when the countdown ended the electronic Cannon system on the satellite signaled power charged adjusting the angle towards the Southwest the Hermos electronic Cannon fired and immediately it Unleashed a beam of terrifying power straight towards the position of Mo zun long and his group they were utterly panicked as they witnessed the bright flash what be careful the explosion that insed was more powerful than an atomic bomb almost leveling a vast area of the city causing all construction and defensive equipment to collapse completely the explosion was so immense that it could be seen clearly from hundreds of miles away in mik like the sun had just Fallen KC and Li ji immediately contacted M to report the situation a large number of enemy forces equipped with heavy weapons have appeared around the safe Zone our defense systems have been completely paralyzed the enemy Air Force has has breached our airspace and is advancing straight to the first Zone we need urgent support to restore the core of the defense system at the hand Mo group skyscraper just now that beam of light destroyed more than half of the core M was extremely alarmed and couldn't help but shout damn it this is definitely a meticulously planned attack Li ji immediately find a way to repair the defense system as soon as possible Ki send someone to contact the headquarters for me I need to know the situation in zone one if anything happens to Mo young lady I won't know how to explain it to ye wo yes KY answered then quickly went to carry out the orders outside the first safe Zone Victor's soldiers had begun their assault charging forward while laughing loudly haha your defense system is finished let's see who can save you this time Victor stood behind his voice deep as he commanded occupied the Southwest area first wealth and beautiful women are on the table Brothers just go ahead and do as you please kill them all for me he turned around emphasizing to his subordinates the second zone is to be handled by the ground troops as for us let's go to the first Zone and see if we could take back Mo zenon's corpse for credit if his daughter is still alive that would be even better it would bring some Joy to the boys haha at that moment their airplane was unexpectedly cut in half a voice of astonishment rang out what the mokong team is still alive GW Chun raised his sword to the sky angrily shouting the minions of the east region dare to commit such Madness Juan how go rescue the young lady the rest of you follow me to fight yes Wan how replied immediately rushing to the Han MoGo Tower to rescue Kai and the others he had to lift countless concrete slabs to find them and then shouted chairman young lady is everyone okay fortunately Mo zun long and his group had been protected by a barrier Mo zun long breathed the sigh of relief and said thanks to the secret treasure of Mr vo we were able to survive Mr hu also felt relieved luckily I reacted in time otherwise the consequences would have been truly unimaginable thank goodness I will take everyone out immediately after the group safely emerged from the rubble Mo zun long immediately asked what is the damage have we identified the enemy yet Juan Hal reported his voice filled with anxiety our headquarters has been completely destroyed the surrounding damage situation is still unclear as for the enemy they are likely from the east region loow G is currently fighting them hearing this Moi could not contain his rage and shouted what how dare those bastards Mr whoie said seriously it must be Victor we have underestimated his Madness and determination in such a short time he has created satellite Weaponry it seems he truly will not allow any of you to survive moai shouted in Anger the ground enemy's assault has been temporarily halted by the second safe Zone but the airspace is completely dominated we still have to worry about sudden devastating attacks from above this situation is more intense than ever but I have contacted guu as long as he returns he will definitely have a way we must endure until then s suddenly a dark figure rushed in Black from the shadow Troopers appeared seizing the opportunity to stab Moi from behind black coldly said too bad you won't be able to wait for him black speed was so fast that Juan how did not have time to react mod Zen long immediately rushed over panicking and holding his daughter Kai black stood amidst the encirclement creating countless clones that surrounded everyone with a derisive laugh you don't need to know Who I Am the leaders of hanm Mo group will die here today return to the dust Juan Hal how panicked shouted loudly damn it we are far too outmatched strategically in that tense moment a rain of bullets suddenly fell from the sky aimed directly at black he had to use his fastest speed to frantically Dodge them the one who appeared was none other than Yu his eyes burn with a fury shouting daring to commit such inhumane acts I will not forgive you touch the one I love you are definitely dead black was astonished to see the aircraft swooping down and smirked is this the Y woo of the rumors he has finally shown himself kill him for me bring him down Black's clone immediately sent forth dark chains wrapping around he's aircraft and pulling it down with Force but unexpectedly the aircraft vanished in a mysterious manner has it disappeared black was confused his gaze cautious at that moment moment yiu switched to the account of the Chen Emperor appearing in a different position his hands Ablaze with fiery Flames clenched tightly around the heads of blackx clones growling die a loud crack echoed as the heads of the two clones were crushed under the power of the skill B rug takes control on the other side moai and her group were still surrounded by blacks remaining clones Yi Wu immediately jumped High delivering a powerful punch downwards to relieve them he shouted loudly Wan how get everyone out of here right now Wan how replied leave the rest to you I will take the young lady for treatment Juan how quickly carried m n along with everyone else and hurried back to a safe position at the same time yuo Unleashed a terrifying explosion creating a massive hole in the ground he gasped for breath looked at Black's clones and said the power of the explosion just now is enough to kill you all but strangely each clone seems to be a real entity yiu frowned astonished and exclaimed clones and even the identity information is exactly the same what kind of monsters are you the east region is actually researching these disgusting creatures opposite him black replied coldly his eyes shining brightly with challenge I am the leader a soldier and also death itself we have found our burial place can you grant us true death Yu's tone turned Grim as he switched Ed his account to the Stars man speaking coldly I just eliminated someone who claims to be immortal and indestructible you have chosen the perfect moment still here I will help you die early with that Yi Wu used his Annihilation skill piercing through the opponent's body despite the excruciating pain black calmly replied this pain is so real just like all the times before it has been a long time since I felt this you are indeed the one we are looking for but now is not the time do not worry we will meet again soon immediately blacks clones vanish Without a Trace leaving ywu in astonishment the energy completely disappeared making it impossible for him to comprehend who on Earth is this black at safe zone no two liai was still commanding the defense system ordering continuous attacks on the forces of the east region team a and Team B took turns firing covering all Firepower determined not to let the enemy get closed the opponent's armored vehicles were very sturdy relentlessly bombarding the stronghold of safe zone no to held by yiu a cold laugh echoed from the enemy ha what era are you living in that you still have to use your hands for defense it's truly no different from primitive people leave the close combat to Black they will defeat that old man for me shio Chan and his team were still fighting fiercely they were facing Black's Legion from the east region a powerful Army that even had the the trump card mobilized one of them wondered what kind of people are these they fight with no emotion whatsoever they carry a strong resentment and each one is very powerful but y w assigned us the task of protecting this place we absolutely cannot lose Yin ran intended to use the trump card to fight but at that moment all of Black's clones disappeared leaving everyone astonished in exclaiming ha y wo must have done something are we not fighting anymore why the sudden change huh the armored troops yelled out loud what the hell is going on why did Black suddenly Retreat quickly contact Victor this is not what was discussed just then an extremely powerful attack came from behind Yi Wu sending all the armored vehicles flying scattering everywhere get lost yiu roared using his area wide explosive skill creating a fiery Whirlwind that swept away all the armored vehicles reducing them to ashes no one had ever seen me woo this Furious Yin Juan hurriedly rushed over worriedly asking Yu did you get there quickly is sector 1 okay yiu hesitated for a moment before answering Moi me I'm afraid it's not going to be okay upon hearing this Yin Juan's face turned pale with panic she immediately ran alongside Yu back to M's location there the doctor reported with a worried expression we tried our best but neither the Master Level doctor nor the highest level recovery magic could bring her back to Consciousness young lady m m has passed away Mo zun long could not stand steady his hands and feet trembling holding his face in despair exclaiming how could this happen M ke gin Ruan stepped forward to take a look and said young lady how could this happen yiu gritted his teeth clenched his fists tightly and said it's all my fault in my haste to find mu way I completely underestimated the madness level of the east region they actually dared to kill M while supporting her father said no don't blame him it's us who have relied too much on him I shouldn't have provoked Victor at that moment I should have been more rational it was me it was me who caused young Master's sister to die suddenly ywu patted M Kei on the shoulder and exclaimed sure up now is not the time to give up hope there is still a way to save moai Moki was astonished and said what are you talking about Kai is clearly dead ywu took out an object to show mokai this this is yiu said the Divine Revival potion the blueprint for Resurrection as long as we find the other two materials we can create it we still have hope Kei I will definitely save you wait for me after hearing y w mention a method to save moi G wangchu and stepped forward to ask again do you have any leads of the rest of these materials Yu said not at the moment Li GSI opened the data and checked then said there is no corresponding information in hanm group's database can we only randomly choose the dungeon to search for a needle and a hay stack Juan how showed signs of frustration holding his head and said surely our documents are not in the dungeon but rather hidden somewhere else at that point we'll just be feudly busy lacking Clues suddenly saraf mini popped out yawning as she said haha I haven't had enough sleep yet I Yu was quite surprised and asked why did you suddenly come out here Sara mini replied isn't it because your negative energy makes me uncomfortable clearly there are clues in the documents yiu was astonished and exclaimed what Clues be more specific the girl answered it's the very bizarre name today that dark name surely has clues about the Supreme high level energy hearing this yiu quickly asked back is it that name black saraf mini replied think about it that name black looks quite mysterious maybe it actually is a special existence with Supreme high level intelligence looking at his expression he is not trustworthy at all yeide really are you serious saraf mini pouted and said being serious is a given moreover after after entering the death era it is actually a kind of special state in addition to using Divine level medicines there are also other special methods that can allow a person to come back to life yiu looked quite skeptical stroked his chin and asked this is the first time I have heard this but how do you know saraf mini replied I don't know I just have a vague feeling about it when the energy is insufficient and the contract is broken we'll talk more about it next time we meet hearing that yiu pondered then said okay after that saraf mini once again fell into a deep sleep yiu hurriedly exclaimed hey why did you only say half of it Moki asked did she just speak the truth yiu answered well her abilities are not yet complete but after all she is the inheritor of surat's powers so she should be trustworthy then Yu thought to himself the knowledge of saraf mini is equivalent to a simulation this time the chances of saving moai are much higher suddenly Victor called and said so the dog from hm Mo group is just gathered here crying huh I thought you guys had run off to the Wilderness Moi shouted Victor he immediately provoked mokai I heard that you were previously vying for power and profit with your sister right now that I helped you kill her how should you thank me Mo Kang angrily shouted you bastard I will kill you Yu quickly intervened calm down down don't let him provoke you he then broke into a wicked smile and said I'm not here for idle chatter in 5 minutes the cannon trajectory will initiate the second round of bombardment this time I will have No Reservations 100% output will turn the entire Southwest area to ashes what but I don't want to be so ruthless if you are willing to hand over y wo then I will generously spare you how about it his Target was actually y wo Mo zun long spoke up you're dreaming father has finally awakened the Southwest area will stand with ye woo existing together until you are ground into dust to be offered to the spirit of my daughter in the sky Victor concluded well in that case you all will be buried with Y wo after he hung up Yi Wu immediately rushed outside and said there's no time left I'll attack right away shoin then asked do you have a way to deal with that satellite weapon Yu said if you can't even handle this little thing how can you save K Leave It To Me 1 minute later Yu had climbed onto the aircraft and shot straight up into the sky breaking through the atmosphere to enter space at the fastest speed the system immediately announced warning approaching the previous maximum altitude account power will soon become ineffective please pay attention host y Wu then switched to the Stars main account and said the universe is your stage show your your true power swapping to the star's main account yiu quickly reached the orbit of the satellite but his face was extremely tense he thought to himself although the power of the Stars man has greatly increased the efficiency of the combat aircraft losing the power of Mo way means I have a bit less control over this super Advanced combat aircraft at the most difficult moment Nana appeared just in time and said master I will assist you from a distance you just need to go ahead and destroy that aesthe ically unpleasing chunk of metal yiu exclaimed in Joy the support was perfectly timed thank you Nana thus they continued to dash straight toward the satellite of the east region but suddenly saw a flash of light is that the signal of an orbital cannon not even 3 minutes in and that old Fox Victor has already launched it Victor below watched the camera and shouted loudly 90% energy that's enough of course you can dodge but that way the southwest region behind you will be completely destroyed what will you do y Wu contrary to his thoughts took the initiative to attack back nana I will concentrate all my power on the cannon targeting it's up to you let them experience the strength of the mechanical Monarch understood defeat them Master on this side the electronic Cannon of the satellite had also fired its second attacking beam the Hermos orbital Cannon fired and yiwu's aircraft was fully charged immediately firing ing towards the satellite the Stellar Cannon two beams of light instantly collided in the middle of space but YW Bean was much stronger directly pushing back the satellite's beam and destroying it in a single shot seeing his satellite completely destroyed before his eyes Victor was overwhelmed panicking as he shouted how could this be heu then leaned into the camera and said to him next is you Victor and this was also hu's declaration of war against Victor as as well as the east region hearing youw say next is me Victor was terrified shouting how how could this be could it be that I will lose he asked where is Black quickly call him over for me as long as black is here there is still hope to turn the tide the technician replied after the shelling ended we could no longer contact him what just then a mysterious figure contacted them on the screen and said of course you can't reach him because I have revoked your Authority upon hearing this Victor was extremely panicked and shouted what do you mean revoked the mysterious figure replied I had you target ywu limiting the development of the southwestern region but you not only activated the satellite weapons but also unilaterally deployed the black unit Legion not only did you achieve no results but you also caused devastating losses Victor angrily shouted clearly I was following your orders now you want to make me a sacrificial Pawn the mysterious figure said you have gone beyond your limits and the entire system has been shut down wait hold on the power is out Victor what should we do now just then a violent tremor from outside made the entire room shake violently what's going on the cameras are down we can't investigate Victor yelled what are you panicking for come outside with me they immediately dawned combat armor and rushed outside as soon as they exited the door they were blocked by Yu yiu immediately said the electronic interference the protection of your base just suddenly disappeared it seems that the master of this dog has also given up on you y woo it really is you thanks to you I have lost everything but I will not give up shoot him for me after saying that they immediately opened fire on yiu but it was completely ineffective against the energy Shield created by Yu Yu then swung his sword and E lessly sent them flying however Yu did not kill Victor only sliced off his mask and approached him saying although I really want to kill you directly to vent my hatred after all there are some things I still want ask you if you confess honestly I will let you go at that moment he still kept his mouth shut insisting damn it I won't say a word to you even if I die you wo directly grabbed his head and shouted that is not up to you to decide what you he who used the skill of brainwave resonance to hypnotize him tell me what exactly is the background of that black guy where is he now Victor then said the intelligence related to the black unit Legion is classified as the highest SSS level belonging to the management of the ancient god Department our technical department knows very little about this everything is carried out according to the orders of he hadn't even had time to issue a command before a wisp of black smoke emerged and silenced him ye suddenly exclaimed so you finally shown up black the black smoke gradually cessed into a complete human figure hearing y wo call him black he replied to be precise you should call me the representative of black y Wu immediately took up a defensive stance ready to attack and shouted are you the one controlling black and Victor he gently responded calm down I'm not here to fight you instead I'm here to negotiate peace Yu sneered and said said now you still want to negotiate peace what a joke the recent attack on the Southwest was entirely Victor's autocratic decision as for M young lady we are deeply regretful today marks the first day of atonment we will promptly exped back compensation and assistance thereafter so could you please stop Yu replied that's quite a calculation why not ask Victor who has just been silenced by you if he believes you're reasoning let's assume for a moment that you did didn't publicly command him to act but you also turned the Blind Eye to his misdeeds am I wrong he immediately asked so what you want y Wu then put forward a condition bring black out here I have something to ask him the other side refused unfortunately that is not possible if it were another condition Yu did not hesitate instantly slashing at him and shouting then no need to talk any further I will personally go meet him all right we look forward to your VIs is it after saying that he gradually vanished Into Thin Air Yu said new ancient god such a strange ability the next battle needs to be prepared thoroughly at this moment the system announced you have killed Victor gaining 13,000 experience points 580,000 in wealth super alloy armor that is praised for its versatility all automatic control regardless of gender or age as long as one wears it they become the strongest Warriors there are no level requirements defense capabilities and maximum health greatly enhance Elemental damage reduced you we thought no level requirement that's very appealing a good item Master Level engineering from beginner to Mastery anyone at the Pinnacle of engineering must read books but for someone already at the top it's just a stack of useless paper function increases the Loyalty level of the structure by one point does not require a rank the maximum defense index increases broadly Elemental damage is reduced by half y Wu thought to himself the advantage of self-learning is that there is no need to read textbooks the energy core is compressed this is not a cookie but the core a small block of compressed energy can blow away 10 buildings or even nine shops The Continuous energy Supply function can double the energy immediately when switching to overload mode but the consequence is that the core will be completely damaged youu wondered the effect is very good but why is it in net shop at this moment in the east region area number 11 the seller test base 174s underground scientists were studying and discussing clearly existing biological features that could prove the stable stay of the Soul a deep sleep without abnormalities good particle disorder status and normal mutation reproduction speed the manager of black had just returned when the mysterious man asked back already the man maner of black replied the fragment has been retrieved good he then handed the fragment to the mysterious man and said Victor that waste almost caused me a huge nuisance consider it a use of the fragments to create but if accidentally the subject's Consciousness awakens it could be Troublesome those above really are something this kind of valuable material should not be casually given to others a scientist approached and asked directors Victor has died today if that woo continues to pursue will he be met with retaliation the other person replied if he dares to come it couldn't be better I have long wanted to meet him once and besides black you must also want to meet your relatives right the immortal ancient god feed appeared and strange creatures surrounded him the east region seems to be quite dangerous now after dealing with Victor Yi Wu returned to Safe Zone 2 to attend an emergency meeting Mo Zen long immediately asked Le wo you're back what is the situation yuu replied Victor has died but I'm afraid there's a hidden hand behind this Mo zun long said I also thought of that it's possible that today war is just a thin layer of paper away from us although I Mo un long am not one to fear death to be honest if a battle starts even if you y wo manage to win in the end the southwest region may very well cease to exist after this conflict Yu raised his hand to show termination I understand your concerns this incident has also been a wake-up call for me I must not underestimate any opponent and moreover must firmly hold the initiative in my own hands cha Chen then said that's reasoning but do you think you should do something after so many battles the east region must be very clear that your strength to play the fool to catch the wise cannot be realized M then said the defense system of the east region is not Infinity C there's no way to infiltrate it like last time Yu sitting with his legs crossed on the chair calmly replied no no you're wrong we basically don't need to hide rather we must confidently enter hearing youu say that M Kei was extremely startled isn't that just walking into a trap or are you saying you have a plan Yu smiled and answered of course we should go to the east region to demand payment at the east region Alliance team Mr huo was having an online meeting with the leaders she expressed her frustration and angrily shouted you are outrageous you actually let Victor activate it report the trajectory are you trying to kill me at least you should have given me a heads up the chairman of blood how military group Monger level 270 said you certainly have to rush to negotiate cooperation with those country bumpkins who else can you blame now moreover the tiny southwest region has already exploded so it has exploded is he daring enough to fight and oay did you run it over to negotiate peace with Y Wu are you out of your mind I want laugh myself to death over you the person opposite is the head of the secret research Department Olay level 255 he immediately said you should use your brain to think the southwest region is certainly not a cause for concern however the so-called yiu is absolutely a presence that can threaten us not only does he have a large number of ancient gods but you've also possesses several types of mysterious powers that should not be underestimated yet he is burdened in this southwest region and we must ensure if he loses at every turn caught in a dilemma the peace negotiations are merely a facade meant to mislead him and slow down his Pace while I will take advantage of this time to make thorough preparations to eradicate any uncertain factors completely laying out a net of Heaven and Earth until we achieve complete Victory and devour everything this is my Doctrine Monger laughed heartily haha that's why you let Victor run rampant distracting that kid into protecting his home Oli replied it seems your small brain contains some nourishment after all Mr Hua disdainfully said I say you all are here loudly scheming in secret won't you fear that things might not go as planned in the end ol I said you need not concern yourself instead perhaps you become too intimate with the southwest region I hope you clarify your stance Mr replied the world is vast and everyone is concerned about profits I'm just an ordinary businessman not calculating like you all suddenly at this moment suin hurriedly called in to report no it's not good ye woo olai immediately asked what's wrong with him he has already arrived at the border gate what at this moment the image of Yu was projected hey that black guy are you looking at me open the door quickly I'm here to collect the compensation we agreed upon I've recorded everything don't think of changing your mind as he spoke ye W played the recorded message regarding the matter of M na young lady we are very sorry today is the first day of atonment and the next compensation and assistance will also be expedited seeing this Olay was extremely Furious and shouted damn it this kid even recorded it no that's not the problem clearly I have arranged a large number of monitors on the routes that had to be taken between the two major areas but why is there not a single feedback signal how did he manage to get through my surveillance network is there a secret passage no way my strategy should be perfect Monger then started to move and excitedly said so what's the point of doing these little tricks I'd rather just go out now and smash him olai immediately intervened you fool stop it are you crazy fighting in front of someone's house if he directly summons the ancient god do you intend to destroy this entire city Mr H teased what's wrong you were so confident just a moment ago and now you're flustered like this oai shouted shut up I'm thinking about the problem Mr huu thought to himself what a freak at this moment Olay was filled with killing intent towards Yu secretly thinking well done y woo it seems I underestimated your courage and wisdom but this courage and wisdom will also harm you because CU I absolutely will not let you leave the east region alive Monger said if you want to get involved with the southwest region this much then you go and fetch the person yourself Mr huu turned and said haha whatever you say I'll see you later Monger then turned to sigal Olay this woman who bites the hand that feeds her is Olay replied don't think she is that simple besides the angel realm still has utility so keep her for now wait until we can squeeze her dry then you can deal with her as you wish Monger expressed his Delight I've wanted to play with her subordinates for a long time after a while Yu's group successfully entered the east region they really let us in just as yiu said the other side doesn't dare to make a move but this place is after all the enemy stronghold we must remain Vigilant and not be careless Mr huu called and said V woo I have sent you the coordinates just send that address grass over here a little later Yu's group met Mr V she immediately asked is this the place tell me how you managed to get past the surveillance yugu replied Wilderness used to be a no signal zone I have the ability to restore signals and of course I can also disable and block them those who want to surveil me are thinking too much impressive impressive I am increasingly in awe of you Mr who all LED them into a room olai and Monger were already waiting there he turned back and clapped his hands saying daring to come here in person I admit you are indeed very decisive all smart people I won't be around the bush tell me how much do you want y Wu cheerfully held up one finger and said great then one trillion even Mr Hua and Moi could not believe their ears Monger immediately slammed his fist on the table and shouted damn it why don't you go rob a bank instead yiu smiled confidently and said you are the real robbers what do you think I came here for after hearing y woo quote a price of 1 trillion Monger immediately drew his weapon and charged at him shouting I see you came here to die Yu swiftly drew the kingk sword to defend himself and replied I haven't finished speaking yet this guy is as hot-headed as a pepper Monger continued to attack with a drill while shouting Kino I'm going to rip your mouth apart YW Ed the shape-shifting ability of the king's sword to transform it into an adjustable wrench and said your weapon is too bulky let me streamline it for you with that yiu moved at lightning speed to modify his weapon making it much more compact he panicked and yelled my armor it's Vanishing before he could even process it yiu swung the adjustable wrench and delivered a solid hit to his face sending him crashing into the opposite wall Yu seemed to be playing with him rather than fighting enraged he shouted at the top of his lungs damn it today you won't leave here alive everyone come here immediately dozens of armored individuals wielding weapons surrounded Yu's group sure enough there is an ambush not only that the captains of the various combat teams had also appeared the captain of the Alpha Team mikon level 248 stepped forward and said long time no see shiao Chan this time I can invite you to obediently accept your death the captain of the Genesis team hu followed closely behind and said gwang Chuan we have a bit of old ties new grudges and old hatred today let's end this together the girl behind was the representative captain of the Phoenix team m z level 195 who then said ywo we meet again gii Wang Chun looked at yui and smiled saying I told you we wouldn't meet turns out this guy has joined the east region Sho Chan spoke to mikon it seems you were still unsatisfied from last time you lost so this time I will totally make you accept it yiu slung his sword over his shoulder and said calling so many people like this are you all that scared of me come here and lend me your courage let's do one against a whole bunch Monger shouted loudly damn it I really can't listen to this anymore someone shut this kid up just as they were about to engage in battle battle oay intervened and said everyone stop there's no need to pay attention to this low-level provocation Yu saw oay using his power and exclaimed the black energy what is your connection with black olai replied I don't have to answer you stop meating around the bush and tell me your true purpose hu walked over took a seat and said it's very simple the conflict between our two areas has become almost irreconcilable and once a fullscale war breaks out there will doubtedly be heavy casualties I'm someone who values peace and I hope to minimize blud as much as possible therefore let's settle this with a duel we can each send out a strong man to represent our respective regions in battle The Winner Takes all and the loser withdraws how does that sound ol I asked in return a small safe Zone in the southwest I could crush it with just a flick of my finger why should I play this dual game with you yiu placed his feet on the table and Cat ually said from the moment I appeared here you have no other choice do you believe that I won't just explode you right now ol I summoned his power and responded although I do not want to fall into a situation where both sides suffer losses I won't accept threats of this level in other words the advantages you're offering are far from enough just as he finished speaking ye W immediately summon the entire image of the ancient god for him to see so is the ancient god enough here it is the pressure emanating from the ancient God made the members of the battle team unable to stand firm damn it my body won't obey I never expected to summon so many ancient gods at once Monger spoke in fear is this your trick Ole replied that's not the true body of the ancient god just a shadow projected into the present world but even so it's no trivial matter Yu snapped his fingers and then said if I lose all these ancient gods will be yours but in turn you have to hand over black and the remaining ancient god furthermore the east region will be incorporated into the Southwest from now on this is my demand ol I said six ancient gods are indeed a very tempting condition but why shouldn't I just directly capture you and force you into submission no matter how strong you are once combat begins not a single person beside you will survive of course Moi immediately shouted although I am quite weak I am not a coward who fears death nor will I hide behind the scenes for a lifetime protected by others Yu you don't need to care about us just go ahead and fight o i pondered for a moment and then said to ywu this matter is significant and we still need to negotiate further you all can rest for a night and tomorrow we will provide you with a convincing answer yeu stood up and left saying all right we'll talk tomorrow after stepping outside Mr who said to Y wo if not you can come to my villa my house is quite large and it's not a problem to have a few more people staying yugu replied no need sister who are you there's an embassy office in the southwest area we can stay there that's fine see you tomorrow then Yin muan expressed her doubts saying it seems like you're still wary of Mr Hua Yi Wu responded after all she's from the east region I'm not Nave enough to let my guard down Sulu added I'm actually very C ious if you had unleashed the ancient god for battle back then what were your chances of winning you who replied using the ancient god is a huge strain on my spirit unless absolutely necessary I don't want to reveal this trump card moreover the other side also has an ancient god so it's better to be cautious especially since I have to be responsible for everyone's lives Sulu said you still think things through thoroughly now we just have to see what cards the other side plays tomorrow yinan then asked Yu so how's the arrangement for the room tonight the young man seriously replied I've asked each person can have a room that's not a problem hearing this she showed a displeased expression H Yu thought to himself why do I feel like she seems a bit disappointed that night while y Wu was lying on the bed suddenly a dark shadow appeared and walked into the room y Wu pretended to sleep and silently thought wanting to harm me isn't that underestimating me too much but instead of plying against him the person pressed down on y Wu and hubbed him tightly I I want you Yu was so surprised that he couldn't help himself and kicked straight at her face shouting damn it where did this pervert come from how could it be you it turns out the one who came is muzi the representative of the Phoenix team her face turned completely red as she spoke in a seductive voice ah ye woo Lord I really want to sleep with you after Yu kicked muzi off the bed he finally recognized her muzy what are you doing here muzi replied ever since we parted ways in the demon dungeon I've wanted to see you every moment during the day in front of everyone I can only endure but now I can't stand it any longer come to me I want us to burn through this night one shot in 10 Rounds Yu was taken aback secretly thinking damn the power of this lustful demon is too strong it's been so long and not only has it not weakened but it has actually become even more intense wait since it's the power of a demon Let The Demon King help you silver up immediately y Wu transformed into the form of the Demon King to help muai regain her composure I why can't I move moreover your form is truly a wicked terrifying demon exuding tremendous power and spirit I am completely entranced can I touch your strong chest ye woo immediately shouted no I command you to immediately retract your abnormal behavior under y Wood's command muzi instantly changed her attitude kneeling and saying of course I am very sincere to Lord y wo and will absolutely not go against your wishes Yu breeded the sigh of relief thinking finally it's done then he said I just arrived in the east region and there are many things I do not know tell me the key intelligence you possess especially about those two individuals muzi began to report I understand first the east region is different from the southwest we have combined all the major corporations and achieved military and scientific concentration with the leading Force being the four big corporations the blood Al Military group holds all the combat teams and mercenaries in the Eastern Area and Monger is their leader she said the Research Institute of secret Arts led by oai has gathered a lot of scientific research and the magic talents can be said to be the top of the east region area Victor and the Black Sea group are all projects developed by Olay currently all remaining members have joined the research institute's Secretariat and the last one is haa you her angel realm group has nearly monopolized the entire entertainment industry in the east region although their combat strength is the weakest their influence cannot be underestimated moreover today after you all left I EES dropped on a conversation between oai and Monger Monger said so how was my performance just now not bad bad right Ole responded with a pleased laugh saying haha ye woo must think that we are very wary of him now relying on the ancient God allows him to Rampage but he absolutely does not realize that controlling the ancient god is as easy as turning over a hand for us this time we must not only retake the plague ancient god but also capture the other ancient gods in one Fell Swoop muzi then said olai is very sensitive to the perception of breaths So to avoid being discovered I did not continue to stay there at EES drop this is indeed valuable intelligence Yu said in the past the east region could only forcibly bind the plague ancient god to activate its powers could it be that they have now achieved new techniques it seems I need to investigate further into this then he immediately asked what do you know about that black guy muzi replied I'm sorry but I don't know much about this before I took on the role of Captain I had never even heard of this person I only once accidentally saw Olay hand a black fragment to Victor and then that black suddenly appeared Yu was quite surprised and said is this a summoning could it be that black is actually not human the mystery is growing he then curiously asked muzi why are you spying around everywhere is it some peculiar hobby of yours she replied isn't it all for you in the east region humans are seen as a thorn in the eye so I naturally have to think of ways to gather intelligence this time I even volunteered to take on the mission to monitor you so no one will suspect anything so that's how it is suddenly muai rushed forward and gave Yi Wu a kiss then turned to leave and said then I will take my leave now as long as you want muzi can always be at your service after she left yide the two consequences I've sound can be seen as both beneficial and harmful since I've gained intelligence I should take the opportunity to investigate a bit at night after going outside Yu contacted mu Liu Lord why are you outside are you here to find me Yu said I'm planning to investigate a bit to see what Secrets the east region is hiding muzi immediately said then I will synchronize the surveillance Network for people you need to be cautious and avoid it Yu interrupted no need then thought to himself if they want to watch then let them watch to their heart's content y Wu U's true eye to look at them and said hey what's the point of watching Men strolling around the streets lay at night there were people hiding behind the chimy next to the trash can in the alley and others hiding behind the tree on the other side I advise you all to hurry back home and sleep they were startled and exclaimed what how can he accurately pinpoint our location Lord what should we do now ol I said hemp only muai hasn't been discovered yet then you stay and continue to monitor everyone else withdraw what a bunch of rubbish yes M thought ye Wu Lord must be doing this on purpose he after they retreated Yi Wu opened the map and said the stalkers have been dealt with but what exactly is happening in this area on the map even true I cannot see through it m z do you know muzi replied over there is the old town there should only be a group of poor people living there ol I ordered that the old town and the new city must not communicate I have never been there y Wu thought to himself very suspicious let's go take a look as he approached the Border he discovered many machine guns from the secret techniques Research Institute ymu contemplated with such tight defense although it's not too difficult to sneak in doing so would easily alert them even with true eye I can't find a way in suddenly a little girl named Alisa level one approached in said brother do you want go to the Old Town y Wu turned around in Surprise and asked how did you know Alisa replied because brother has been staring at the isolation gate from the very beginning Yu thought I completely didn't detect the energy of the little girl Alisa continued let me tell you secretly actually I came here by illegally immigrating from the other side I also know a secret passage do you want go with me Yu decided to follow the girl and ask while walking you lived in the old town before do you know why they isolate both sides Alisa answered because there are bad people they trick everyone into going to the research institute for work they can make a lot of money but the uncle and Aunt next to me didn't come back after going they must have been harmed by bad people y wo immediately asked so youve run over here yeah after arriving at a manhole Alisa said here it is we can get to the Old Town through this drainage you Wu suddenly drew his sword and said to think you would hide in a place like this but your little Act is about to come to an end isn't it black Alisa stopped pretending and turned back to ask how did you see through it Yu replied although I don't know how you disguise yourself the information about you has always been clear to me he then said indeed you have some skill no wonder we all find you interesting Yu looked quite surprised and said what do you mean by we are you saying those who appeared earlier in the southwest area were not avatars were they all you how is that possible he then took out a sight likee weapon and said ordinarily this would be impossible but the ancient God has never adhered to what is normal y wo exclaimed so you are the one controlling the ancient god in the east region sealing off the space you want to fight here he immediately replied it's just that I don't want to be disturbed moreover you may be mistaken about one thing I am not the one manipulating things it is the ancient god as soon as he finished speaking he charged forward to attack Yu the girl Ina immediately wielded her Scythe to charge at ywu and shouted I am the ancient god haha struggle some more your power isn't just this is it don't disappoint me or you'll die yigu evaded for a while then she used her arm to attack her but due to Black's peculiar nature she instantly transformed into a dark shadow to a vague Yu strike in an instant she appeared behind her to launch a surprise attack however yiu had anticipated this and swiftly grabbed her with another arm she gasped in surprise you have more yiu responded meeting three times do you think I would be unprepared for such bizarre abilities you claim to be the ancient god but I don't feel you are that strong Alisa shouted angrily looks like you don't understand at all then she deliberately took a strike from Yi Wu to launch a surprise attack what her sight grazed Yu's face and although it was just a small wound it transmitted an excruciating pain causing y Wu to scream loudly Anda smugly stepped forward and said it hurts doesn't it we have to endure the torture of this fatal curse every day I thought someone who could subdue an ancient god like you could handle it but it turns out you are just an ordinary Human After All at that moment yiwu switched to the Stars main account and she immediately recognized The Familiar force and exclaimed this massive energy is it possibly the same as before ywu Unleashed her powerful energy and said indeed the curse is very formidable it is almost indistinguishable from the Royal nightmarish bind back then but in front of the Stars man it is still far too insignificant Alisa suddenly changed her attitude and said I didn't expect you could actually overcome the Eternal curse you are indeed the one I have been looking for ye woo was quite surprised by her words and asked why has your stance reversed you want to find me what is your goal Alisa replied don't you want to find black true one I can help you because I also want to save her Yu asked in confusion what do you mean Alisa began to explain the secret Research Institute has always been studying how to completely control the ancient gods among which The Immortal ancient god fat lch is the hardest to control not only because it possesses is a formidable immortality but more importantly it can instantly seize the concept of life and death from all living beings trapping them in an endless cycle of reincarnation devoid of birth and immortality she said that is more of a curse than immortality if this difficult problem cannot be resolved it will be impossible to control the ancient god the East can only seal it within the space of the dungeon and continuously capture people from the slums of the old town for experimentation after countless failures they finally discovered the perfect experimental subject Black's curse and her body seemed to perfectly merge into one entity hence she was chosen as the medium the research institute began to continuously extract the boundless power of the ancient god using Black's spiritual personality as the original to produce the black unit Legion which possesses immortality yiu exclaimed in Surprise is that the origin of the black unit Legion Alisa continued actually I am a member of the first generation of the black unit Legion at that time their technology was not yet mature I figured out a way to escape their control and unilaterally severed the connection of Consciousness with the crowd so that they could not find me later they improved their methods all the black Legion were made from fragments of the Soul summoning and the summoned entities could not perform any acts of betrayal moreover they seemed not satisfied with creating a humanoid Legion and began to manufacture various kinds of bizarre monsters you W thought of the black stone and said it must be What mo I saw Alisa continued until one time I actively connected with a group of Consciousness for investigation I found that although her main body was in a deep sleep her soul has been enduring tortures until now she continued and in the deepest part of the sea the only sound I can hear is the plea for death I truly want to die please anyone just kill me it can be said that we are completely the avatars of the ancient god the power of the ancient God grants us the strength of immortality but it also brings endless suffering and torment therefore I want to save her to end this nightmare Yu then called IIs and asked how is it I Vis replied the Spectrum shows normal she is not lying after I Vis confirmed this Yu said it sounds like you want to cooperate with me so why did you attack me Alisa answered if I want to challenge the ancient god I must confirm your strength and resistance to the curse otherwise if you are controlled by the curse you become a hindrance yiu said I see you are quite thoughtful since we have a common enemy of course we can join forces I hear that the east region has specialized techniques to deal with the ancient god do you know the Inside Story Alisa then turned to leave and said Remember the toolkit to bind the ancient God's plague that was just a test item the real binding of the ancient God has been developed now you best be careful and you should return I will contact you before we meet next time good night the next morning Oli contacted Yu to inform them of their decision after hearing this Yu was quite surprised and asked are you saying you want to start a duel right now Olay replied exactly isn't that what you wanted we have agreed after thorough discussion is there a problem Moi then said I thought you two would discuss it for a few more days you Wu smiled and said no problem at all if you want to fight we can accommodate whenever then he thought to himself it seems last night's actions have indeed kept the opponent on guard oline then said the venue is set at the second Arena of the royal gold Fighters you can enter through the dungeon teleportation gate please go there yourself the next day at the teleportation gate of the dungeon shaen was quite surprised and asked why are there so many people here Yin Hanan also wondered it seems there are even ticket sellers could it be that everyone is here to watch us duel yigu sighed and said it's likely that she is the only one who could seize this opportunity for profit just then who are you arrived and said the southwest region is facing off against the east region the winner becomes the king and the loser gets nothing how could I possibly miss out on such a great chance to earn money trailing behind her was the singer chuai vwo long time no see Yu said I knew it aulu looked atai and asked that girl is yinan answered don't you usually watch TV she is suai the number one Idol in the east region suai walked over looked around and asked why haven't I seen Yuni and kxi yiu replied this trip is a bit dangerous Yun won't be coming and kexi is inside a dungeon helping would support work hearing that she expressed disappointment and said what a Pity I actually had a new song I wanted to share with them a bit yiu then said isn't it good that you'll be coming to the Southwest to hold a concert next time by the way Yuni is an avid fan of singer tulai Suddenly at this moment yiu was startled opened her mouth and silently thought wait a minute isn't that concert supposed to take place inside an artificial dungeon I remember the artificial dungeon is the patent of the Angel realm and with two Heavenly Angels involved could it really be a coincidence then she said to be honest I don't really understand your company very well Su could you introduce it to me suai replied well you've asked the right person actually until 20 years ago the company was still a research institution it was only after sister huu took over that it changed into an entertainment business called Angel realm I was also discovered by Sister hu youu to be a star at that time who you suddenly interrupted her through lie aren't you supposed to prepare for your live broadcast later ah I almost forgot sorry everyone I need to head to the venue first see you later saying that she ran off youu looked after her a Sinister smile on his face hu watched and felt a cold sweat thinking to herself this is very suspicious after a while the final match finally commenced dear leaders guests and audience the long awaited showdown between the southwest region and the east region is about to begin the competition format this time consists of five matches one against one both sides will arrange their Fighters independently and the side that wins three matches first will take the overall Victory it's worth mentioning that before the battle begins both sides will not know who the opponent has sent to fight making the order of appearance extremely important will the southwest region underestimate their own strength and grow stones at a mountain or will they deliver an intense Showdown that exceeds everyone's expectations let's wait and see first up on the main stage is the fighter from our east region initially representing the mighty Tian chuong group from the southwest region and hailing from the Genesis team hu hu expressed his dissatisfaction saying so they've sent me to this stage first if I encounter you woo I might as well just kneel and surrender right then and there what's the point of fighting the MC announced his opponent is rumored to hide an unparalleled face behind that mask Yin Hulan comes from the Mong team Yin Wan Yin muan stepped onto the stage and said even I didn't expect Yi Wu to let me take the lead I will definitely not let this trust go to waste coincidentally today we will settle old debts hu F thought to himself as Yin H swung the sword at high speed toward him yeu has given me such an important task in this first battle I absolutely cannot disappoint him the MC excitedly commented oh my contestant Yin hu is unleashing a small sword with the momentum of the mountain and the island sea contestant Hui is being suppressed how will he respond now Hui immediately activated overload mode and thought damn it if I can't even handle you Yin Juan then how can I survive in this east region contestant huay opened the overload mode although this form could increase attack power on a large scale after continuous use he would fall into a long period of paralysis it seemed he was prepared to gamble One Last Time hu quickly gained the upper hand but Yin Hulan showed no signs of weakness saying last time I lost to this move I won't fall into the same trap again King's sword yinan surprisingly took Yu's sword to play which made hu extremely astonished what it's Yu's weapon again immediately he was sent flying into the air by Yin huan taking advantage of this opportunity she charged up to use her ultimate skill the leaf silver wind a combat technique creatively devised by Yin Hanan employed two swords to unleash continuous attacks creating highspeed strikes that threw the enemy off balance meanwhile she herself was enveloped in an invincible State hu faced a crushing defeat and as he fell to the ground he cursed damn it you only know how to rely on men yinan replied how fortunate it is to have someone to rely on someone like you who only knows betrayal will never understand the first match in the southwest region was a victory as Yin Guan stepped down from the arena Yu expressed his admiration congratulations on your victory was that a new technique very beautiful suddenly she huged y woo and said thank you y woo youa provided me with a solid support helping me regain my confidence y wo overwhelmed with joy from the Embrace could only smile while the audience from the east region was now extremely frustrated yelling have we lost again the southwest region isn't just a bunch of wheat chickens how could this happen it was hu who was too weak he is after all the useless one from the southwest region who are you ye mocked tole starting off unfavorably then Oli calmly responded failing when betting on inferior horses is to be expected don't don't worry unless gu Wu takes the field himself the southwestern region will definitely lose the second match who are you yeah then asked so what if y Wu appears he replied then this entertainment performance will come to an early end at this moment the MC announced no mercy for the defeat of hu next up on the main stage is the superclass battle architect the trump card of the secret technique Research Institute the captain of the AER team mikon and his opponent is the number one expert from the Mong team the cold and handsome guy G Wong Chun maon sh disain and said I thought XA Chen would be my opponent how could you possibly think you can compete with me at this level GW Chu and coldly replied if I'm alone it would indeed be difficult to deal with you but I'm not here by myself as soon as he finished speaking he drank the Master Level allpurpose potion which maximized attack Power Defense power speed life points maximum mana and greatly increased critical hit ratio and critical hit damage overall myON was suddenly startled and shouted damn it you were openly taking drugs this referee is cheating the referee replied using drugs does not constitute a violation the match is about to start please prepare player Micon round two begins and player Wang Chuan immediately initiates an attack damn it how can a technician let me fight against the Swordsmen do you think I would say that suddenly he smiled smugly and then a beam of light emerged from outside shooting straight at gwang Chuan with the exceptionally fast reflexes of a swordsman he easily dodged and exclaimed an attack from outside the MC excitedly commented here it comes it's the intricate Firepower grid that player mikon knows best he actually set up numerous fortresses outside before the match although this doesn't count count as a violation this tactic is truly dirty mikon then said after all people are lazy I hate struggling with others so I naturally had to do some preparation after using his Extreme Speed to dodge the beam of attack ji wangchu and activated the domain of the conferred deities and said a child's game break it for me MC immediately exclaimed oh my God could this really be the Legendary Ultimate skill of the leader of mom a sword player that moves like the wind how brilliant it must be jiwang Chuan swiftly approached Micon and said you have no way to escape now MC commented the martial arts of infinity are unleashing all Firepower and lasers outward is contested myON about to be cornered Not only was M con untroubled but he also grinned with delight are you talking about yourself as soon as he finished speaking he quickly pressed the activation button causing a terrifying explosion to occur right beneath ji Wang Chuan on the arena the situation suddenly reversed dramatically the explosion caught everyone off guard could it be that he is invisible when did he set this up so perfectly as the host I completely failed to notice Mike unun smugly remarked don't underestimate the self-defense capabilities of Master Level engineering suddenly a massive Whirlwind appeared in the middle of the Arena causing mikon to exclaim in horror what is this at this moment moment gwan chuan's Health was at only 3% just enough to activate the skill secret meaning annihilation of all enemies thank you for locking my heal for me now take this move in an instant 1,000 sword strikes were Unleashed at supersonic speed leaving maon completely unable to defend what did I just witness the Cyclone the air current even space itself is being sliced apart what terrifying sword skill is this could it be that the player G Wang Chuan has reached the legendary Realm of the sword Saint luckily the player M con appears to still be alive but he has lost Consciousness I declare that the winner of the Second Battle is still from the southwest region ji Wang Chun even Yi Wu was quite surprised by this move on isn't this the ultimate move of the baby Beetle when did GW Chuan learn to steal it Oli slammed his hand down on the table in anger and shouted how could mikon be defeated by jiwang Chuan how is that possible damn it it looks like I Can Only Resort to the emergency plan the control room immediately sealed the dungeon implementing Plan B the control room where are you people why aren't you responding at this moment in the control room no one is Left Alive those in the east region really enjoyed playing devious schemes but everything was anticipated by Yi wo control room respond hello hey Olay turned pale his inner turmoil thought clearly both matches should not involve the arena yet they relied on auxiliary props to exert effects twisting right and wrong and now they can metal in matters outside the dungeon could it be that everything is within your calculations ye woo so you are not only a powerful Warrior but also a terrifying backstage manipulator I have to admit you are the strongest enemy I have ever encountered if there is no way to defeat you fairly then I can only resort to my final means as soon as he finished speaking numerous holes appeared within the dungeon and countless monsters flew out from them threatening those present everyone remained motionless with violators facing death who are these people don't come here suddenly a large number of people wearing mysterious masks surged into the arena where are the guards where are the guards at this moment Yi Wu and his group remained extremely calm gii Wan Chuan while taking medicine said the east region here doesn't want to perform anymore with so many ancient god clones do you have any counter meeters Yi Wu replied don't worry everything has been planned out this is exactly the situation I wanted to see Yi Wu glanced at kuu and thought to himself the artificial dungeon is an exclusive of the Angel realm who youu is undoubtedly involved in this I just don't know how exactly she plays her role whether she is merely a gambler for profit or has some other ulterior motive kui also looked at Yi Wu and thought vwu show your potential to the fullest y Wu immediately contacted Alisa and said I'm making good progress over here the black unit Legion has been lured out you could start your actions now Alisa quickly replied thanks for drawing the fire for me then let's begin the infiltration and combat at this moment Alisa had sneaked into the research institute thinking to herself thanks to that little brat leading the black Army to cause chaos the institute's security system has become weaker than ever opportunities like this may only come once in a thousand years thinking this she immediately used her incredible speed to bypass the security cameras even the security robots completely failed to detect her presence as she moved she excitedly told herself let's just push straight into the enemy's Lair however just then a laser barrier appeared in front of her Alisa exclaimed what is this with her Superior agility she quickly made it past the first laser obstacle but the problem didn't stop there after overcoming the first barrier she faced a web of laser beams so dense it seemed impossible to get through for a moment Alisa felt Panic unsure of what to do next but suddenly a thought flashed in her mind making her chuckle to herself almost forgot I am the immortal body with her calmness restored Alisa continued to move toward the center of the research institute eventually she reached her destination and thought I've arrived I will rescue her right away just then a strange sound echoed in the quiet space the sound of footsteps Alisa jumped quickly turning around drawing her weapon and loudly asking who's there from the Shadows a man stepped out his deep voice resonating finally you have returned my daughter Alisa did not hesitate immediately charging forward to attack and yelled loudly who are you you dare to call me like that are you in a hurry to find Death however just as her Scythe was about to touch him Alisa suddenly halted she wondered what is happening why can't I strike he looked at her calmly saying it is only natural how can a child harm their own father Alisa was stunned exclaiming no way that man has been dead for a long time you cannot be him before she could finish her sentence the man appeared behind her covering her mouth M he whispered in her ear my dear daughter just sleep in the haze of falling into Eternal Slumber the story shifted to yiu at this moment he and his teammates were surrounded by countless avatars of the ancient monster one person spoke up relying solely on our strength we cannot eliminate all these monsters conserve your energy and avoid direct confrontation with them but time and again the strength of those monsters proved too Mighty making it far from easy to cons serve energy everyone understood that this was indeed the trial on the path to becoming a Powerhouse they persevered buying time for yiu to find a way to deal with it from above Ole looked down an air of smugness in his gaze a cold smile on his lips it's useless useless in front of the immortal black Army any resistance is meaningless I am truly impressed by your foolishness olai continued in such a situation being able to endure without taking action is admirable but if this continues all of your friends will die why not obediently summon the ancient God ywu took out a toy and said what are you talking about my ultimate move is already prepared this Soul scale can be used to annihilate enemies a lower rank than myself it has the ability to directly eliminate capturing up to 100 targets at a time but it cannot be used against boss level enemies the execution time ranges from 5 to 60 seconds depending on the number of Target targets and after use it requires 72 hours to recover in an instant the soul scale sucked all the monsters inside this left Olay in great shock God level props yet it has the ability for forced a rager of rules how do you have such a freakish thing Yu replied you don't need to worry about that although there is still no way to completely kill the Avatar of the ancient god at first glance if it revives it will certainly take some time he smirked looking directly at Olay what are you planning to do now I deliberately kept you alive don't let me down upon hearing this Olay immediately knelt at Yu's feet trembling as he said I know I was wrong please spare my life Yu chuckled softly hi you understand the situation then tell me your plans at this moment he Unleashed countless strands that tied up Yu tightly and shouted you have been deceived Yu asked in Surprise is this the ancient God's restrained device olai replied correct this is my greatest Masterpiece the person locked by it will not be able to use any skills including the power of the ancient gods normally it would be hard to restrain you with this but you after all are too careless I will take away your power of the ancient gods for your foolishness you will pay a heavy price as soon as he finished speaking an attack pierced through his heart it turned out that Yi Wu had long used the Machinery control skill to free himself Yu smirked faintly indeed a finely crafted artifact but in front of the god of Machinery All Creations are mere toys in my hands olai trembled exclaiming in shock how is it possible my greatest Masterpiece crumbled so easily ye Wu coldly replied A Heart pierced through yet still alive you indeed possess Immortal power but it seems compared to Black your abilities are much weaker he trembled his voice filled with bitterness I truly am a failed product if I had the full power of the ancient gods just relying on you Yu smiled and said what's so special about a complete ancient god I have subdued six ancient gods and I am no less formidable than the two in your east region why don't you summon the immortal ancient god and another ancient god here to save me some time at this his face suddenly turned pale he gritted his teeth trying to hide the terror in his voice don't get cocky like that more more over not to mention the immortal ancient god the other one is a taboo among taboos do you know that you are trying to bring disaster to everyone y Wu thought to himself this reaction is quite interesting it seems that the secret ancient god in the east region is definitely not a simple matter suddenly the door to the dungeon closed a cold announcement rang out initiating self-destruct sequence for the dungeon countdown 10 minutes the crowd began to panic screams e Cod everywhere the teleportation gate has disappeared self-destruct what kind of joke is this open the door open the door for me and what about the organizers hurry up and explain at that moment an image of Monger unexpectedly appear on the large screen he laughed loudly his voice brimming with arrogance haha didn't see this coming did you I have waited a long time for this day this time both the east region and the southwest region will belong to me who are you yeah olai and Y woo you will die in this dungeon farewell olai shouted angrily his eyes filled with killing intent Monger you bastard you dare to scheme against me ye W thought to himself Marilyn has also lost contact what on Earth is happening out there at that moment who are you ye Follow by su Le approached and said I can't believe we were set up by Monger could his usual rude demeanor have just been an act it seems I underestimated him ye W immediately asked who are you ye sister what should we do now suai suggested can we contact the control room outside the dungeon before who will you ye could respond suai shook her head and said no this time I'm not an illusion so I can't do what I did last time suddenly hula Yu ye lightly tapped su's back and confidently said don't worry I have prepared something for you in advance suai suddenly screamed in panic who are you ye sister my body is disappearing Yi Wu stared in astonishment at the scene unfolding before them he could not tell what the object who Yu y was holding was but it made sweet Le vanish right before their eyes Yi wo shouted who are you ye where is sui what exactly do you want to do who all you ye replied Conley don't be anxious I won't harm her just look up Yu looked up and was immediately astonished to exclaim Sula why have you suddenly grown so big suai at that moment was also bewildered looking down at her body and stammering I I don't know either suddenly everything turned out like this who are you ye quickly explained the original plan was to use this key tonight but due to the circumstances I have no other choice yiu eagerly asked so what you mean who are you ye replied inside this key contains all the research data on the artificial dungeon that I have conducted over the past few years however at the moment all that data has been transferred into cley's body to activate the latent Powers deeply asleep within her suai was surprised reaching up to touch her neck and then exclaimed in horror huh since when do I have a hole on my neck like this Sulu stepped forward her gaze fixed on suula and said the first time I saw you I had a strange feeling indeed you are not like an ordinary human being are you who are you ye nodded continuing that's right but unlike you in SEI suai is a product of a gene enhancement experiment Sulu immediately asked Gene enhancement experiment are you referring to the project of cloning newborns implanting chips and modifying human bodies that plan was aimed at creating powerful warriors with special abilities from a young age correct who are you ye nodded his eyes revealing regret that's correct however an unexpected fire destroyed all of our research achievements the evidence at the scene clearly indicates that this was a deliberate Act of sabotage most of the researchers either died or were seriously injured while the experimental clones were nearly completely annihilated who are you ye continued suai is the only Survivor she l collapsed in the ruins as if suspended between the boundary of reality and illusion the places scorched by fire had turned into nothingness though it seemed difficult to explain at first glance in that moment I realized that it was the power of the dungeon transformation such a miraculous ability how could it fall into the hands of others therefore I deceived the other high-ranking leaders secretly rescued her and simultaneously sealed all her past memories from then on suai took on the identity of a music star beginning a new life not only did it help the company generate income to operate but it also allowed us to quietly research her unique ability hitting two Targets with one Arrow the so-called dungeon is in essence a different space created based on a certain Special Rule sula's ability is to transform her body into a different space capable of absorbing fire and avoiding harm she took out a small object held it up and said do you remember this it's the mini dungeon generator thanks to the temporary dungeon space created by this device we survived under the bombardment from Victor's orbit this is the result of the combination of suiz power and the artificial dungeon technology we developed hearing this Ole couldn't help but speak up so that's why you stole that precious experimental object no wonder we've been searching to death without finding it turns out it was always right in front of us huh who are you ye immediately spoke up is the so-called Darkness Under The Lights really like this moreover the more famous suai becomes the harder it is for you to compare her to the labat of yours suai suddenly hugged her head and said finally I remembered that fire had you who are you ye sister I am very grateful to you for saving me and giving me a new life but in your eyes am I ultimately the singer suai or the experimental subject x 486 who are you ye gently smiled and replied at first I only saw it as finding a precious lab rat taking good care of it just so I could use it thoroughly later on but as I watched this lab rat grow day by day somewhere along the way it left me with many Cherished Memories by the time I realized it I could no longer look at it with the cold eyes of a researcher this is called kinship isn't it hearing that suai was deeply moved choked up and speechless at that moment YW suddenly appeared interrupting their G mental atmosphere as he spoke apologizing he said as far as I know the artificial dungeon technology comes from the northern region do you have any relationship with them who are you ye unexpectedly responded how did you get this kind of information the matter of the northern region should have been completely sealed off Xiao Chan was sweating and said can we wait until we get outside to talk about this there are only 3 minutes left before the dungeon gets destroyed the time until the dungeon is destroyed was down to 3 minutes who are you ye calmly replied don't worry zulai has now merged with the dungeon she can directly bypass the external control to open the exit suddenly sing shouted wait a minute there AR too many symbols and numbers I completely don't understand this information who are you ye sister please help me oh no it's over Yu said with exasperation I told you did you only focus on the experiment and not teach her how to apply her abilities suai turned back stuck out her tongue and rolled her eyes at Yu did I mess things up Yu shouted think of something fast a few minutes earlier outside Marilyn was still intensely fighting against the black Army however no matter how much she slashed they just wouldn't die they clung to Marilyn's legs and repeatedly said stop the mission system notification there is 1 minute left until the dungeon is destroyed realizing there was not much time left Marilyn angrily shouted ah these monsters won't die no matter what she had not yet had time to act before being bound tightly by the energy ropes instantly monger's men approached her Marilyn screamed let me go Monger smirked sinisterly you are Marilyn yeu summoned Beast right what a strong woman you are as he spoke he moved closer to her his Tong flicking out hungrily anyway in just a minute that foolish ye wo will be gone so why don't you just come with me I will love you day and night give you pleasure and bring you to the heights of ecstasy his perversion made Marilyn lose all restraint rage surged within her and she switched to a state of frenzy no I cannot forgive Monger was thrown back startled and shouted what Marilyn couldn't control herself she Unleashed utter Devastation with a single slash she wiped out Monger soldiers in an instant Marilyn sced screed die die the sword energy slashed out tearing Monger clothes to shreds he panicked and yelled the black Army and my men were annihilated in the blink of an eye how is this possible monster what what kind of monster are you at that moment Marilyn had lost all reason with a killing intent surrounding her she shouted kill kill kill anyone who dares to harm y Wu will die the group of yo had just successfully broken out of the dungeon and and escaped yiu smiled exclaiming ah we finally made it out haha thankfully we had everyone's help hearing Yu's voice Marilyn turned around and hurriedly called out ywo yo immediately asked Marilyn why did you end up like this I'm sorry for making you worry with just a touch from y woo Marilyn instantly returned to her normal State um um as long as you're okay that's good at this moment olai and Monga had also been tied up haa Yu stepped forward and mocked haha a schemer filled with plots and someone who thinks there a sparrow picking up seeds yet in the end both became prisoners how does it feel olai shouted shut up traitor Monger angrily said it's all your fault for interfering otherwise my plan would have succeeded who are you ye confidently replied why bother being so belligerent after all this is a world where the are respected I simply chose to invest in the stronger side Yu sighed and added but in reality you bet on both sides from the start and only decided to Stand By Me In the End who are y y shot a glance at Yu then gently said although an excellent Merchant doesn't easily wager everything I have always been very supportive of you y Wu thought silently I don't know how much of this is true or false but right now I can probably confirm that she is my Ally suddenly L Olay shifted into a strange State his eyes turned bloodshot a creepy smile spread across his face as he said he speaking as if you have already won you have never even seen the true darkness of the east region and you are making a fatal mistake with that he Unleashed his undem power piercing through monger's body G what are you doing let go let me go olai pulled out two black Stones grinning ominously feel the true power of death immediately the two of them merged into a monster Olay and Monger fused soul of death Fusion level 300 o I laughed loudly haaha this is the power of death the power of the ancient god I am no longer a failure I have reached the Pinnacle of perfection I will devour all of you absorb your strength and become the new ancient god Yu shouted no matter how you look at it you are still a failure a failure should not dream of stage two just vanish quickly at that moment another wave of energy came from behind y wo accompanied by the voice of H all yui ringing out wait leave this to me y wo is taken AB huh who are you y level 290 since you've made your stance clear let me also show a bit of sincerity she stepped forward leaving y Wu in astonishment you you are H are you yeah I can't believe it even in a battle State you still look so beauti beautiful seeing who you ye in a different form everyone was stunned and couldn't help but exclaim this must be her true self right so beautiful who are you ye approached Olay and said I haven't worn this outfit in a long time let's see if my skills have diminished today Olay was also taken back realizing that the person before him had always hidden her strength he chuckled sinisterly however this light cannot compare to the darkness of death let see if you can withstand it or be annihilated by this wave of curses as soon as he finished he Unleashed a wave of fatal energy shooting straight toward H yui and Yu's R sha chin and sui panicked as they realized this contains a very strong curse we can't move anymore death curse reduces movement speed by 99% causing a loss of 4% of maximum health every second immediately who youu ye activated the holy light curtain purifying the wave of death energy holy like curtain purifies all negative effects in a large area around oneself and continuously restores life the cooldown time is 360 seconds haa yui cast a spell and said let the darkness dissipate Holy Light binds the evil enemies who are you ye immediately use this skill to bind him the chains of light bind the target with the power of Holy Light with a duration of 15 seconds and double the effect against enemy enemies of the undead and demonic systems no matter how hard he struggles it is useless he can only panic and scream loudly it can't be with his ability to move lost he can completely not resist she turned to Yu vwu the rest is up to you yuu replied then I won't hold back Yu switched to the account of the Chen Emperor charging forward and unleashing countless sword strikes towards the enemy he didn't even have the slightest chance to retaliate his heart filled only with resentment as he screamed how could this be in the blink of an eye y Wu easily sent him back to dust without expending any effort who are y ye admired silently in thought I didn't expect y Wu to be able to use a smooth sequence of skills to eliminating a level three monster so effortlessly I know Yu is strong but I didn't expect him to be this strong choosing decide with him was indeed the right decision killing oay and the sole Fusion of monger Wu received 2 million experience points a reward of 10 million death cells and necrotic biotissue that can be used to craft items two fragments of Dark Soul surrounded by countless deaths can summon up to 19 black Army Warriors to fight for you for 2 hours with a coold down time of 24 hours the super elastic triangular tight pants it is said that ho has prepared 100 identical pairs of underwear to train strong legs helping to withstand the intense battles at night their attributes are to increase endurance speed and the favorability of the opposite sex towards you y Wu thought to himself is that all it takes to defeat them after merging I lost my immortality it feels strange moreover what the hell is that last piece of equipment I wouldn't wear it even if you paid me after Gathering the loot Yu said to who all you ye up until now everything has been according to your plan right Oli and Monger are no longer here your Angel's realm has become the largest force in the east region who are you y replied aren't you going to thank me y Wu smiled of course from now on the east region will always be loyal to you whether it's technology Finance or Manpower as long as you want it I can provide it unconditionally ye wo asked sister who all you ye is so generous there must be something else you require right who are you ye replied you can't see through me it's not difficult I just hope that if the northern region attacks in the future you will protect me Yu was surprised and said Northern Region you really are from there who are you ye continued don't be tense I severed ties with them a long time ago right now I'm only living for myself but that's also why I'm worried one day it will come back for Revenge suai curiously asked sister H are you ye can you tell me who you really are who who are you ye answered if I tell you you will be shocked in the past I was the Priestess of the temple in the northern region that's the highest position just below the pope upon hearing this Su exclaimed in admiration wow that sounds really impressive who are you ye went on to say although the northern region is closed off it doesn't completely ignore the outside world years ago I was sent along with another Priestess to monitor the other major regions and I took the opportunity to escape Yu then asked why was that who are you y replied at first I just wanted to get close to the upper echelons of the Eastern region so I participated in a talent competition unexpectedly someone from the talent search noticed me and brought me to compete officially and I unexpectedly made it to the finals upon hearing this sud was incredibly astonished and admired asking is it true that hu y sister is yii the famous idol singer who appeared suddenly and then disappeared over 10 years ago who are you ye replied oh that title is really too exaggerated can you imagine the great impact on a girl who lived a life without aspirations when she stepped into the entertainment world with absolute faith in her goddess it was nothing less than a rebirth after coming to understand the entertainment world I could no longer return to being Temple priest tiny as I once was y Wu then asked is the dungeon Fallen Angel in the wilderness related to you who are you ye fell silent looking saddened and said you truly have been there that was inde our main objective back then we built the experimental base for the Heavenly Angels descent plan and the angels realm was initially established for that purpose but as you have seen the outcome was a complete failure y w asked mu way has also mentioned similar things if the northern region truly has any schemes why must they summon the angel hearing IU's question who UI was taken back you're talking about mu way the legendary Relic Hunter it's no surprise you have such information if it was him who told you then it's nothing unusual this matter is complex it can't be explained clearly in just a few sentences dealing with the aftermath of monger and Olay will take some time once everything is settled I will gradually tell you at this moment the black Army which Yu had influenced using the soul balance was gradually coming back to life sha chin saw this and shouted in panic stop chatting these monsters are coming back to life Yu then asked Can you purify them who are you ye replied I can't with O's in complete immortality it might be possible but the black Army has a strong connection to the ancient god I cannot purify them completely at this moment the monsters not only did not Attack yo but instead were polite and asked are youber Ally do you believe in the method to destroy the immortal Yu was quite surprised to hear the monster say this and asked her how do you know in her heart ye W thought it has been a long time since Alisa sent any information could it be the monster spoke just now the karmic connection was lost but now we have understood the cause and effect our desire is to eliminate the Immortals she has failed and now we can only rely on you and your allies you have possession of the fragment from the soul which means you are also our Master as long as you Channel power into it you can summon us to serve you Yi we smiled thinking looks like I have an additional team of highlevel soldiers quite convenient the monster continued our goal is to eradicate The Immortals once the mission is completed Please Release us so that we can return to our place of rest Yu replied all right I agree with you time is of the Essence let's depart quickly allies and be careful of the immortal and white as soon as he finished speaking they immediately dwelled into the soul frightened you who heard the monster's last words and thought to himself who is that person could it be that besides o there is someone else controlling the immortal ancient god suddenly sin spoke up vwu the black Army in the dungeon has also come back to life Yu replied I almost forgot about the group resurrected them there I will go subdue them right away I will open a simple teleportation gate for you saying that sui opened a teleportation gate for ywu leading him into the dungeon Yu thought to himself black just mentioned the time is pressing it seems that the one behind the scenes still has some schemes perhaps all the secrets will be revealed at that research institute at this moment a black soul was flying into the gates of the research institute that Soul was olai Olay thought finally I finally made it I strained every last bit of my energy to dodge Yu's fatal blow making Monger my substitute and allowing him to survive but if I delay any longer my soul will vanish like a Candle in the Wind I must proceed with the repairs immediately suddenly a voice echoed is this sole fluctuation from Olay Olay was startled and turned around to find a man in white standing behind him he quickly pleaded for help is it is it you thank goodness come help me activate the soul repair device and find me a body the man in white merely smiled and approached Olay causing him to panic why are you still standing there hurry up olai backed away and said in confusion no this isn't right you you can't be I killed you years ago the man in white smiled in response you may kill a mortal body but can you truly kill a legend his name is cows one of the Legendary Heroes with a level of 500 after after Gathering the black Army in the dungeon Yi Wu headed straight to the laboratory when he saw that there was no one there yiu was surprised exclaiming huh where are the guards why is there no one around just yesterday it was all so strict suai walking behind said could it be that oai or Munger have sent them away given their Ambitions perhaps Yu replied it's hard to say anyway the research facility is a crucial place by the way is it okay for you to be with me like this it could be very dangerous up ahead s Li smiled and answered don't worry I'll take care of myself she added cheerfully he it feels adventurous an hour ago Yu had announced to everyone that he would go alone to find the boss which made everyone oppose this isn't right either just now I missed my chance for a fighting match my hands are itching you say you want to go alone to the research facility why who are you yeah insisted on following take me with you I'm sure I can help you another person said do you want to be a hero all by yourself everyone looked at ywu not understanding yiu explained I appreciate everyone's kindness but this trip is likely to face an ancient god it's not just about having a large group handling it alone would be easier for me upon hearing this the others had no choice but to voice Yo's words make sense but do we really have to rely on you suddenly suai stepped forward and said please let me go with you Yu was surprised and asked why should it be you sui explained after sister Hua youu ye told me the truth I vaguely remembered some things from the past but my memories are still incomplete I want to return to the place where I was born to see it with my own eyes maybe I can remember something Yu sighed inwardly thinking but she completely doesn't know how to fight at this moment Kua yui approached and said let her go even though kulai doesn't know how to fight her special abilities are enough for her to protect herself she won't be a hindrance to you in fact she might even be able to help you seeing yiu hesitate CI used her cute face to plead please yiu truly felt helpless with this girl and ultimately agreed to lever come along returning to the present yiu used his employee card to swipe at the gate the system confirms successfully welcome back Dr Juku yiu was surprised and said Juku has been dead for a long time yet they still haven't deleted the data saving me the hassle of breaking in my own place suai exclaimed joyfully you can come and go here since we're already here letun go in together Yu replied all right let's get going with that the two of them entered the laboratory they encountered several security robots but you handled them all with ease doors that were locked had also been smashed by him after a while they reached the central position soon Li remarked things are going smoothly aren't they Yi Wu reminded the defenses in this area are too weak which is a bit strange so don't let your guard down suai looked around and said is there really no one here this place seems like it used to hold something could it be that all the members have fled suddenly Yu spoke up S what are you doing suai was feeling around for something and replied after returning here my memories have indeed become clearer I recall there being a secret door here she continued to Fumble for a while and finally pressed a button immediately a secret door opened Yi Wu exclaimed in Surprise it really exists they had entered that door but after walking for a long time they still couldn't see any destination yiu curiously asked we' have been walking down nearly 100 m right could it be that this is where you were born suai replied I don't remember much about that I only recall seeing people in white lab coats bringing many experimental samples in here carried in sacks smeared with blood I couldn't even tell whether what was inside still retained its human form Yu asked do you feel afraid suai answered of course I do but I desire even more to completely put an end to these brutal tragedies after after a while the two finally arrived at the deepest experiment base in the basement y wo exclaimed in amazement are these all corpses of the black Army the chief researcher of the esoteric Arts research Society cows said surprised aren't you actually those are just the waste of failed experiments even the black Army itself is merely a byproduct of the experiments only she is truly perfect yiwu immediately took a defensive stance preparing to attack and said it seems you are the one behind all these events suai thought to herself why does this person feel so familiar he extended his hand towards yiwu and politely said don't misunderstand I have no interest in those boring power plays my goal from the beginning to the end has only been one that is the power of the ancient god as someone who controls the ancient god why not consider cooperating with me ye W immediately asked may I ask a question replied please go ahead yuu said with an arrangement like a cult how did it end up in the basement of a scientific facility to be blunt what is your relationship with the old world domination Society he answered their ancient gods summoning ritual is quite interesting so I've referenced it and made some improvements is there a problem with that instantly yiu drew his sword and shouted thank you for being honest there's nothing to say to a mad scientist like you I will soon collect all the ancient gods you had better hand them over now to avoid suffering later he remained calm and said your immense power is the source of your confidence but clearly your vision is still not broad enough Yi Wu then slashed down with his sword shouting arrogant words he thought he would inflict damage on him but unexpectedly the man easily deflected Yu's strike with just one finger he said no I prefer to speak with the truth from his hand a Soul Ray shot out directly flying toward gu Wu and shouted body hand over your body hearing the voice Yu was extremely surprised could this voice be Olay olay's Soul rushed straight into Yu but in just a blink it was cut in half by Yu immediately afterward yiu used Star Eater to absorb his soul while saying this time you won't Escape anymore ol I pleaded no no I don't want to disappear like this after eliminating olai Yi Wu immediately activated Eye of Truth to observe cows he thought the power just now is definitely not at level 150 this guy has hidden his strength let's see who you really are cows level 500 Alchemist Master engineer Master pharmacist special special occupation creator of Darkness one of the legendary 5S Heroes after reading the information Yi Wu was extremely amazed level 500 5S hero he then said you really can see through my information truly a person with many miraculous abilities yiu thought to himself this is not an enemy to be lenient with I must use all my strength then he immediately used Dawn shattering to attack however Kos not only showed no signs of worry but instead was extremely excited the power is truly terrifying I feel as if I can see the brilliant light of the stars in the universe is that the source of of your power saying that he took out the primordial sacred treasure one of the primordial items capable of returning everything to its origin wonderful truly wonderful this power must belong to me immediately Yu's the Stars main form disappeared causing him to be greatly surprised what why has the Stars main vanished cows had entered a Battle Stance and declared your power has been expelled kneel and submit to me as caos took out the primordial sacred treasure Yu's the Stars main form instantly dissipated Yu thought to himself another primordial sacred treasure what does returning everything to its origin mean system explain it to me the system replied even you will be restricted by it this system is of course not affected by such a small tool please don't misplace blame host currently due to the effects of the Divine weapon the host is in a special State unable to receive any effects unable to transform form forms and this state cannot be dispelled the system continued the currently locked account is the chilian Emperor and it cannot temporarily switch accounts this means that yiu can only use the account the Chen Emperor for now Yu then asked that's a bit of a hassle wait a minute you said mostly subz using experience points to level up get restricted the system was checking after a while it replied check completed leveling up is completely unaffected ye immediately ordered then use all experience points to level up the system announced received converting experience points conversion completed linked level raised to 50 equivalent to regular level 500 linked level reaching 50 unlocks the special job system yiu was quite surprised a special job H the system explained a special job is a new ability unlocked at level 500 unlike ordinary individuals you can only have one special job each account of the host has a corresponding special job completing job missions can yield new powers and special equipment significantly enhancing account strength for details please explore on your own the special job of the chai Emperor has been unlocked the final flame Emperor the current job level is level one with a maximum of level 10 current effects a dark flame form evolves into a more powerful chaotic blue flame form which allows for more more flexible control over attack fire the damage of the fire is unaffected by defense and is not restrained by attributes High the attack can stack the debuff inflammation each level reduces 1% of the enemy's maximum health stacking up to a maximum of 10 layers at maximum level it can stack up to a maximum of 99 layers ba all fire and Chaos attribute skills will increase damage by an additional 30% Bon receive a new skill flame Emperor charge a quick attack on the target dealing great damage to the Target and enemies in the path characteristic definitely cannot be interrupted can actively stop cool down time is 1 minute y Wu thought to himself this is not the maximum form of the Chen Emperor limited edition that I once had in the realm of Blazing Flames but here it is only at level one could it be that the maximum level chaien Emperor could continue to evolve just like the Shadow King evolved into the Stars M does the Chen Emperor also have the opportunity for a new transformation but it seems that I currently do not have the spare time to slowly explore taking advantage of y's in attention he launched an attack and happily said although I have heard that you occasionally experience a sudden surge in power I didn't expect you to crazily level up right in front of me this truly exceeds my imagination I never thought that in this era there would be someone who could reach a state similar to mine y Wu immediately activated the intermediate class profession flame Monarch level one then said 150 years ago you were the strongest human but now that's not necessarily the case suai standing behind exclaimed in surprise wwu you have a new form again so cool yiu laughed and replied ha leave it to me next kaaos then used his primordial sacred treasure saying the primordial creation has no effect it seems this faint flame is your potential very interesting I am becoming increasingly intrigued by you but do you have the qualification to call yourself the strongest after saying that he summoned the life form the heterochromatic python creating three snakes rushing towards ywu Yu stomped hard on the ground and said let me test my new skills in an instant the three snakes were cut into hundreds of pieces by Flame Emperor charge these weak creatures were not enough to make Yu expend any effort next was cows y Wu immediately swung a sword towards him and shouted put away that arrogant attitude cows the times have changed chaos thought to himself can this flame reduce my maximum health with an abnormal State flame scar reduces 1% of maximum health unable to fight head-on he continued to use the summon life form wind elf skill transforming into Wings significantly increasing his speed and evasion ability you did not hesitate continuing to used flame and pararge attacking directly towards his position and shouted don't even think about escaping no matter how cows tried to dodge this move could not be avoided he immediately summoned a life form stone giant to absorb Yu's attack then continued to change attributes summoning a life form Frost Giant in an attempt to counter Yu's Flames however at this level ice and snow had no effect against Yu's fire in an instant the frost giant had turned into esteem Yu then said summoning beasts no these are artificial beings created by Alchemy right I never expected he could use consecutive summons to neutralize my attack and Counterattack indeed the legendary hero truly has talent but that makes me even more Curious history records that you were the founder of the east region why did you become a mad scientist researching ancient gods CS replied death is the end of all things no matter how glorious the achievements before death may be after death they mean nothing especially after the Earth is polluted human life is cheaper than paper many people haven't even left a mark and in this world they have already become a handful of golden Earth chaos continued it's truly unfortunate but the immortal ancient God has shown me hope that Humanity can transcend death if my research succeeds Humanity will Ascend to a new historical phase and Achieve greater capabilities ye will replied that sounds nice but have you asked the common people who were forced to be subjects in your experiments or black chiquan whether they want to participate in your tests for Humanity I see it as more for your personal gain cows replied I am the one overseeing the experiments and I am the strongest among Humanity without me could you succeed moreover for the advancement of all Humanity those sacrifices are inevitable I thought you would somewhat understand my perspective but it turns out you are just as ordinary as olai it seems I overestimated you hearing this ywu was quite surprised and asked Olay chaos then recounted the story he was once my most capable assistant but in his quest for power he poisoned me the scene shifted back to when CS was poisoned Ally coldly said you are old now so old that even I can easily kill you the east region no longer needs those decaying Legends farewell stay in that world and watch me lead Humanity to True immortality chaos continued to cover up the traces of the murder Ola set fire to a large area but he didn't know that I had long prepared a spare body through clumb experiments to regenerate thus hiding in the shadows and continuing to carry out unfinished experiments Not only was he unable to achieve complete Immortal power but he was also distracted by administrative work completely unaware of when a new researcher suddenly appeared in the research institute indeed he is truly a complete fool suai was extremely astonished to learn this truth so the fire was caused by Olay if it weren't for that fire I might never have the chance to gain my freedom chaos said not only you even my daughter took the opportunity to escape amidst the chaos of the fire This truly exceeded my expectations but the Clone body was too weak making it take me a long time to restore my Peak form otherwise how could I let such a precious test subject as you go hearing this Yu was incredibly angry gritting his teeth and shouted wait you just said she is your daughter how can you dare to use your own daughter for experiments are you even human he replied what are you talking about this is for the great plan for all Humanity a little sacrifice like this is insignificant moreover her life was given by me so what's the problem y Wu immediately charged forward throwing a punch at kaz's face then shouted angrily I do not want to hear your excuses any longer you speak eloquently but your actions are utterly inhumane cows you are dying cows was not one to easily give up quickly summoning a black dragon of level 490 to fight ewo you want to kill me dream on tremble before absolute power summing the Supreme Being black dragon thos as soon as it appeared it used the black flame of Destruction unleashing deadly black fire towards y wo but if if it came to playing the fire nothing could surpass the chaien emperor yiu swung his sword fiercely and said come on fighting the fire is my strength I have never lost the chaos flame Emperor sword was immediately unleashed the fire from The Sword exploding fiercely terrifyingly effortlessly shattering the black flame of Destruction and taking away 60% of the black dragon th's Health the black dragon thos let out a painful Roar then charged in with Reckless attacks losing control however bees attacks posed no difficulty for yiu at all yiu then said unruly attacks this is just Fury are you powerless Upon finishing his words Yi Wu immediately used the mixed flame Shadow sword technique to attack the black dragon thos sending it back to its ancestors resting in peace in the nine Springs yiu showed some regret and said the gigantic Dragon close to level 500 what a Pity if I could transfer accounts I would definitely tame you at that moment chaos suddenly appeared behind y Wu and said just a little carelessness at your feet can lead to disaster he had used King's Rook castling disregarding the distance to swap places with his summoned creature after that he used ancient god restraint to bind ywu he smiled wickedly and continued this is not like the trash in olay's hands don't even think about escaping die chaos thrusted to spear through Yu's body but very quickly suai had used her power to open a portal to the dungeon right at the location where he was stabbed Yu was taken AB what this is suai is it really you suai shouted I Won't Let You harm ewo as long as I have this power calps was Furious thinking to himself damn it that little brat dared to ruin my great plans but I must continuously Channel magic power into the restraint to vent y wo from escaping I can't spare my hands to deal with her thinking about it he immediately took out the fragment of the soul and said it seems it's time for you to show up instinctively the black Army was summoned sui exclaimed in panic the dead monsters are coming back to life she also took out a fragment of the soul and said not only the living can summon the life protecting artifact that ye who gave me can also summon the black Army sui's black Army also appeared and and they all shouted in unison protect the cooperating person thus the battle between the two black armies erupted chaos said you have a lot of tricks up your sleeve but how long can you maintain them when your magic runs out that will be the time for you and Yu to die at this moment yiu was indeed facing some difficulties he looked around and said damn it if I could control Machinery this thing would be destroyed in no time even using the full power of the final flame emperor I could break this restraint but it would only be a temporary Escape is there any way to smash it all at once just then he suddenly thought of something and a wave surged into Yu's head oh it seems something is flooding into my mind it was indeed the memories of the black Army connecting their spirits to yiu through the fragment of the Soul inside Alisa's memory her mother calls her my little Alisa don't be afraid I'm here with you you will surely get better quickly she whines Mom it hurts so much I don't have the strength to stand up anymore kis picks the little girl up and says there's no way to save her anymore but I have a way for her to live on Alisa's mother bursts into tears no how can you use your own child as an experiment sometime later the little girl says Dad I can really stand up now kaaos Pats her head and says Alisa from this day on you will be the leader of the black Army your new name is black the girl cries out in pain ah kill me just kill me I can't bear it anymore cels just stands there watching and says your body has been granted the ability of immortality even I cannot easily kill you accept reality and carry out your duties well for the black Army black runs after cows what are you going to do to my sister where is Mom where did she go I command you to put her down after watching the memory yigu thinks to himself this is the the past of black Anna and cows her body stopped developing since childhood due to the experiments and she had to endure Relentless pain the perfect specimen turned out to be her sister ye W thought Anna's heart is filled with anger and dissatisfaction I can sense that she is always trying to break free from C's control the black Army said she is now connected to a larger group so we can use the shards of the death soul to create a coercive effect on the black Army helping her Escape her predicament right one person from the black Army replied your idea is not wrong chaos is currently focusing most of his power on you and his control over her has decreased significantly however unlike us she is a special case belonging to none of the shards coercively ordering her would render the shards of the de Soul ineffective at least for a while they would not be able to summon us again if we fail you and that girl will fall into the underworld that voice came up again cooperator have you thought this through Yu thought to himself if we fail then we'll just take the risk giving our all and dying will be better than living I trust you wake up and fight against that scummy father immediately Alisa awakened instantly appearing behind cows and striking a blow leaving him utterly astonished what is this how could you no this is not good the limits of the primordial sacred treasure have been lifted at the very moment the primordial sacred treasure lost its Effectiveness yiu shifted to the Stars main account using Starlight bursts to break free from the Restraint of the energy force the explosive power sent the black Army and cows flying in all directions this was the power of the universe K screamed uhh how can this be how can I lose to you Yu stepped on his back and said it's over chaos you have lost just as Yi Wu was stepping on cow's head he suddenly threw out a black vial immediately after he used King's Rook castling swapping positions with a snake's tail catching y woo off guard Yi wo scoffed text this trick again even a corpse can use it after the position change chaos thought to himself his strength compared to before has increased so much could he be a monster I need to get back the primordial sacred treasure otherwise I can't face him head on at all the the opportunity has come he saw ex singai sitting alone and immediately rushed over to take her hostage however Yu would not easily let him execute his plan he immediately created a miniature artificial sun pulling cows back and shouted who allowed you to run around did you ask for my permission first the exclusive profession of the Stars M Planet manager has been activated the current profession level is level one unlocking passive skills Planet power can directly utilize energy from the planets in the current star system the final scale depends on the host level the existing abilities include miniature artificial sun and moonlight great sword Yi Wu thought to himself the skills of the Stars main are mainly supportive but that's understandable after all this account is already strong enough and just looking at the description shows endless potential with this artificial sun n's spaceship charging problem will be solved seeing cow struggling Yu said stop thrashing around the gravitation force of the sun is 330,000 times that of Earth you can't escape chaos shouted so what this level basically can't kill me yugu replied oh really then first I will torture you a little is that okay chaos screamed in pain stop stop right now what good does this do you can we talk Alias spoke up vwoo let him down I have something to discuss with him Yi Wu replied all right I will adjust the gravity so that he can only stand firm you can rest assured Alisa replied and then stepped in front of him thank you he hesitated and said Alisa immediately she gave him a strong slap and yelled this is the name my mother gave me you are not worthy to call me that this punch is for my sister this punch is for Uncle mecho sister Wendy and all the people you have harmed the last punch is for myself die scum as she spoke Alis continued to punch cows hitting him until she was exhausted Yu stepped forward and asked are you done venting your anger she panted and said Huff Huff it's enough for now but the level difference is too great I can't kill him outright chaos then said pure emotional outbursts what does that achieve I have truly lost but don't think you can get anything from me what has happened cannot be undone even if you die they cannot return to life you should understand this clearly Alisa was Furious to the point of Madness but there was nothing she could do yuu walked up to him and said to be honest I am really disappointed after learning the legend of the heroes from years past about the principle I have always respected you the ones who created this safe Zone but you have fallen to this state afraid of death playing with lives it's truly hard to believe chaos gritted his teeth and shouted you have only lived for a few decades how can you understand my feeling a few decades life is so short are you not afraid of death if there were a chance to become immortal would you easily give it up y Wu calmly replied of course I don't want to die if there is an opportunity I must seize it hearing this kaaos became overjoyed and said really y w interjected but I will use my own way to achieve it absolutely not like you contemptuous of human lives so what if life is short in this limited time let us burn brightly striving to conquer the unreachable Peak knowing it cannot be done yet still do it even if we fail we do not regret that is the greatness of Being Human you have also stood at that high point but have you forgotten this simple principle hearing youu say this chaos suddenly recalled the joyful time spent with his loved ones hesitating unable to say a word chaos held his head I ASA then kicked him in the face and said even if you want to repent now it is too late but you have said that everything is irrevocable right now the only thing you can do is quickly release sha high and then accept the Judgment that awaits you he glanced at his second daughter but suddenly she woke up and stood up surprising everyone ye M and Alisa exclaimed in unison what Alisa's younger sister suddenly awakened exuding a powerful force and shouted loudly Alisa immediately asked what happened is this also you're doing Kaos replied it's not me I did not activate the ritual of at all but this Aura is undoubtedly that of the immoral ancient god could it be that it has taken advantage of the old world's King's order but this state does not seem to be of full descent either before he could finish speaking The Immortal Force suddenly invaded his body pulling him closer to Alisa's sister even Alisa was not spared being drawn in an instant leaving Yu unable to react in time Yu said so it finally appeared I have been waiting for you a long time Immortal ancient god come here feeling the power that even the God of destruction feared the ancient god merely glanced at yiu and then directly fled into the wall leaving Yu utterly astonished ha it's running away after the immortal ancient god left Alisa returned to her normal State and said the immortal ancient god ran away without looking back why did I dream about this suai exclaimed joyfully it must be the power of Yu that scared him Alisa was quite surprised to hear that is that true or not Yu then asked is that the sealed space of the immortal ancient god inside Alisa replied mom that is the strange space connecting chiai and the immortal ancient god known as the dead sleep dream Sula used her abilities to scan inside and turn to say I have scanned through it the space behind this wall was probably originally an artificial dungeon but after being transformed and invaded by the ancient god it has now become completely unrecognizable in terms of the situation inside YW thought to himself Su Li is becoming more proficient in using her abilities he then said the dream dungeon it reminds me of some bad memories in the past I hope no strange things will appear again suddenly Alisa hesitated and blushed saying um just now you saw my past right Yu replied yes it activated automatically I don't don't have a habit of snooping into others memories but I didn't expect you to be Black's sister no wonder you want to save her so much Alisa shil said it's okay thanks to you I was able to escape allow me to introduce myself my name is Alisa I am the daughter of cow and also the first person to be called black as for my younger sister black is not her real name but now that no longer matters as long as we can defeat cows and the immortal ancient God we can free her from this nightmare can you all continue to help me the two immediately agreed without hesitation of course let's move forward after all this was also Yu's goal but having Su follow would be too dangerous he turned to her and said no suai you stay here sui immediately protested why not inside there is the dungeon space I'm sure I can help Yu placed his hand on her shoulder advising what lies ahead is a direct confrontation with the ancient God it is still too dangerous for you if something happens to you how am I supposed to explain it to whole you ye sister don't worry I've defeated many ancient gods before I will definitely return safely this time I'm still looking forward to your new Alum Yu's words were so persuasive that they immediately made SI lie feel overwhelmed with joy vwu um I will wait for you after that the two of them prepared to enter inside Alisa said are you ready this could be a trap after all U replied it's fine when troops arrive generals will block them when water comes the land will stop it I'm just afraid you will continue playing hide and seek with me Alisa said you are really calm well I can't help but feel tense yiu said let's go and the two of them stepped inside suai outside continuously cheered come on you must come back safely as they just entered the dungeon the system immediately announced the dungeon Quest dead sleep dream has been activated please assist the dream master in defeating the immortal ancient god you asked does dream master refer to your sister Alisa replied dead sleep dream can materialize the scenery in a person's mind that could be it just then suddenly a hole appeared in the sky Alisa said look the sky seems to be cracking you who found this scene quite familiar and said I have an impression of this scene could it be that the ancient god has arrived at that moment the immortal ancient god fat Li duck appeared in the sky and Below him a group of people was performing a ritual to summon the ancient god they all shouted in unison oh great Immortal God you have finally descended please bring Salvation to this meaningless world the ancient god immediately used the dead orb and said little humans you have worked hard to summon me if you desire the power of immortality I shall fulfill your wish without hesitation he directed The Dead orb towards a group of people taking the lives of all within that area ywu immediately used a shield to defend against his attack be careful the people that the ancient god just exterminated have turned into zombies they will surround us you w thought to himself zombies the inspiration for the black Army I understand now the two of them immediately attacked the horde of zombies Alisa shouted loudly let me handle these little fish you go and deal with the ancient god Yu replied not so fast the mission mentioned a dream master but he hasn't appeared yet suddenly two beams of light approached the ancient god Yu was startled as he thought huh what is that Golden Light from afar the first one is muu my disciple level 500 this is not good we are a step too late the immortal ancient God has already been summoned the one accompanying him is cows then we must elim ated here team charge forth he immediately summoned his monster to attack surprising both y wo and the others could this move be from CA how is that possible could it be that this is not Shia High's dream but rather ka's dream muu used his Divine pen to create a beam gun array and shouted cows Don't Rush In Too Deep wait for me to support you ywu observed and thought to himself looking at that writing brush there's no doubt that person must be muu the attack seem ineffective as if transformed by some kind of power the ancient god angrily shouted these pesty insects you are not worthy to become my subordinates vanish into nothingness with that the ancient god used the black hole of nothingness to suck cows in at that moment yiu appeared and blocked the attack for the two then flew over and said to Vos I am here to lend you a hand muu asked in wonder are you ywo we'll talk later first let's defeat the Ancient God the ancient god looked at Yu's appearance and showed concern exclaiming the power of the Stars it can't be the shadow of the Stars it's descended upon this world again moreover why do you carry the aura of a different kin who exactly are you ye W thought to himself indeed this ancient god is merely a projection in C's memory impossible to subdue in that case whether to kill or not is irrelevant just follow the dungeon procedure and lend them a helping hand immediately afterwards he Unleashed his Moonlight sword Shadow to attack the immortal ancient god Cales seeing this exclaimed joyfully so strong so strong truly capable of immediately suppressing The Immortal ancient god it's not entirely one-sided let's not just stand there letun go help muu looked at Yi Wu and thought I don't know why he gives me such a familiar your feeling yet his appearance is completely different after that both of them surge forward to assist Yu causing the ancient god to scream in agony why am I so unlucky after such difficulty to reach this world I absolutely cannot be devoured by him saying that the ancient god opened a rift in space to escape but was locked down by muu with chains he shouted don't even think about escaping Divine chains seizing the opportunity while the ancient god was bound cows rushed in and struck him a Blow To The Head Immortal ancient God die already however after all this was a god killing hint was not an easy task chaos immediately took out a primordial sacred treasure to seal the power of the ancient god using the multi-layered ceiling technique after landing on the ground chaos continued to use the Soul Stone to confine the ancient god inside and said so this is the end Yu thought to himself this is a sealing techniques specifically designed for ancient gods it seems they have put in a lot of effort to deal with the ancient god muu seeing cows do this angrily shouted cows what do you mean why didn't you kill it just now y Wu observed thinking chaos ultimately has the action of retracting the blade is that the weapon to kill the ancient god but if so why has he never used it before is there some restriction or did he not want to kill the ancient god from the beginning seeing cows had the chance to kill the The Immortal ancient god but chose not to muu was Furious chaos then said I simply do not want to kill him because keeping him alive has great benefits muu shouted great benefits didn't we make it clear long ago do you want to resurrect your deceased loved ones it's been so long and you still haven't let go Kos shook his head and said it's not like that what has happened cannot be reversed I have long understood this principle but precisely because of that I want to study the immortal ancient god using his power to carve out a brighter future for Humanity muu suddenly shouted that is an ancient god not something an ordinary person can easily control do you not realize that this is playing with fire chaos loudly replied mu youu you are too self-conscious if even we are considered Ordinary People then who in this world can bear the responsibility of saving it Stand By and Watch two men argue you w thought to himself cow's words to me before have not changed at all he truly believes this could provide an Avenue for Humanity I just don't know when his initial passion has distorted into a mad scientist who belittles life on the contrary muu has become a passionate and righteous young man suddenly everything came to a halt leaving yiu extremely surprised this is a time that has been frozen at this moment the system appeared presenting Yu with two choices please choose the individual you wish to assist a muu b cows seeing this y Wu said is it necessary to be so cruel in the happiness of choosing one of the two after thinking for a moment he continued in my personal opinion I would definitely help mu you but according to the course of history kaaos is the one who ultimately Smiles for safety I should helped CA thinking about it y wo immediately chose to help Cows as soon as he clicked the timeline resumed its operation muu turned to ywu and shouted even you want to help him although I may not be a match for you I absolutely cannot sit idly by while the power of the ancient god is abused if you want to help him you must defeat me first yiu was taken back thinking to himself I haven't even had a chance to say anything why has the plot accelerated already immediately a fierce battle broke out between y Wu and mu Yu the speed of the fighting was quite fast in just a few seconds mu was lying in a heap his subordinates remained nothing more than mere subordinates new youu a he struggled to get up and exclaimed the Gap in strength is indeed so great Yu replied you are the one who suddenly wanted to fight me suddenly muu fell silent saying it seems I was mistaken you are certainly not him if it were Yi Wu he would never act like this y broke into a sweat thinking I am also quite helpless muu sprang up and said since I have lost and am the defeated one I will obediently leave however Cals if you truly abuse the power of the ancient god I will definitely not stand by idly then he left Yu side thinking to himself if that is really the case where have you actually gone at this moment kaaos walked up and said to yiu thank you for helping me in fact I do not want to fight with friends yigu then asked what are your plans next CS replied I plan to rebuild a city here turning it into a base slowly researching the abilities of the immortal ancient god one day I will transform this place into the final Paradise of humanity he raised his hand showing his determination Alisa stood by observing then spoke up even though ye W has helped you I do not trust you the ancient god can Devour the human mind what if one day you fall into depravity suddenly chaos took out aord from his bace and said muu once saw the primordial sacred treasure skeleton of time but even that weapon could not completely kill the ancient god therefore I have traveled across the continent collecting Legends materials and blueprints related to immortality and then used Alchemy to fuse them with a replica of the skeleton of time in the end I created a Divine sword specifically for the immortal ancient god Excalibur no death seeing the sword in caza's hand Alisa exclaimed in surprise this sword could it be that kaaos gave it to Yu kaaos continued it is not only extremely sharp but can also render the powers of the immortal ancient god ineffective I no longer need to use it if one day I truly fall I hope you will use it to put an end to everything yiu observed The Sword and thought to himself in reality I do not possess this sword but since cowos is not using it where on Earth has it gone suddenly the space around Yu began to crack sending him into a panic the space is collapsing could it be that I made the wrong choice seeing Alisa standing in a Daz Yu shouted what's wrong with you snap out of it Alisa jolted and asked what exactly is happening y Wu frantically yelled were you just zoning out quickly grab hold of me we're about to fall the two of them fell straight down into another space Alisa suddenly asked is this the laboratory of CA have we exited the dungeon Yu replied no I fear we still have not before he could do anything chaos had already commanded the black Army to attack ywu and shouted loudly I can't believe it's been over a hundred years you've actually came but since things have come to this point I will absolutely not stop my experiment kill them the black Army charged forward annihilating The Intruders these monsters were basically like ants yeu didn't care at all in instantly darting straight towards caos and thinking so this dungeon actually involves time travel what do they want me to do this time YW grabbed his neck and pinned him against the wall the system then presented a choice should you kill cows a yes be no y Wu frowned in annoyance thinking not this difficult Choice again without hesitation y wo immediately crushed him to death and shouted loudly although your starting point was good your s sins are unforgivable Alisa appeared regretful Yi Wu then said don't worry this is just an illusion in the dungeon once we get out I will hand him over to you to deal with Alisa then slashed open the nutrient chamber containing her sister rescued her Dred a coat over her and shouted now it's over right after that a gate appeared Alisa asked is this the way out you replied yeah let's go back but as soon as they stepped outside a horrifying scene unfolded before Yu's eyes Alisa was holding her sister in a pool of blood and even XA Chan was lying motionless under the rubble all around was nothing but smoke and fire ywo shouted in panic what on Earth happened why is everyone dead shuai and yinan have also been murdered this made Yu extremely Furious he glanced at the ancient god and shouted Immortal ancient god immediately y wo Unleashed a powerful slash splitting the immortal ancient god in half the system of Yu suddenly announced detected that the host is at risk of being trapped in the dungon activating time reversal mechanism you can go back to any previous Choice branch do you want reverse now hearing this Yi Wu was very surprised what so I'm still in the dungeon Yi Wu angrily yelled system go back to the First Choice Branch the system responded received proceeding he continued good that Immortal ancient god almost tricked me it seems that the previous weakness was all an act just to lure me in and swallow me in this dungeon I can't let you be smug I will find your true form and put an end to all of this after ye woo made the wrong choice the result was that everyone perished this left him extremely frustrated and he immediately activated the system to start over when he returned to the moment before the two men were still arguing at this time the system presented ywu with a choice which person do you want to help yiu didn't need to choose he immediately took cows back to reunite with his grandparents then handed the Soul Stone to muu take this muu was utterly bewildered unable to comprehend what was happening okay okay what the hell is going on yiu smiled confidently thinking that the outcome would certainly change but it didn't the outcome was even worse than before Yi Wu exclaimed in astonishment why did it go straight to the bad end do I still have to help cows the system announced this dungeon has multiple branches please utilize your rewind ability to explore the true ending yiu then said all right let me try each one immediately after yiu continued his process of navigating through the dungeon yiu chose to help cows deciding not to kill him however he then combined forces with the immortal ancient god and if he chose a different option Alisa would be controlled and faced a bad ending in this way nothing seemed right Yu thought for a moment and then decided to help no one but to directly eliminate both that would be fair wouldn't it but no matter how he tried the result always led to an unfavorable situation Yu started to lose his composure feeling anger inside as he thought this ridiculous mechanism apart from someone with the ability to turn back like me who the hell can break through this garbage dungeon are they joking with me ye W return to the time with the two of them were arguing but not making any choices holding his head in thought Alisa saw this and asked what's wrong Yu you seem a bit strange yiu replied it's okay to tell you actually it is after yiu recounted the whole story to her she analyzed it seems this dungeon is completely under the control of the immortal ancient god he deliberately set many traps like this clearly wanting to trap us here until we die but from your description at least helping cows is not wrong after all this is his dream it has to follow his wishes at that moment ye we suddenly exclaimed no if this is really his dream that should not happen because kaaos has always wanted to use the power of the ancient god never thinking about freeing the ancient god he began to think in another direction if it is not cows then the true owner of the dream can only be her thinking for a moment yiu chose to help cows and walk to his laboratory in instead of killing him yiu tied him up and Drew his sword he immediately asked what are you planning to do Yu pointed the sword at Alisa's younger sister and told him NPCs without autonomy should shut up and watch seeing Yu having an interest in his sister Alisa exclaimed in shock wait y woo what do you intend to do without hesitation y wo immediately swung his sword and said the original Mission hinted at everything find the master of the dream defeat the immortal ancient god after many reversals I began to understand that chaos is not the master of this dream this is indeed little Black's dream Alisa shouted but there's no need to kill her she hasn't turned into the ancient god yet yeu explained black in reality has been possessed by the ancient god and here it's no exception moreover you previously told me that black has a strong desire to die isn't that her wish furthermore don't you see that the immortal ancient gods had seemed too weak before because his true form is right in front of us Upon finishing her words y Wu immediately unleashed the sword Aura towards Black's nutrient chamber she instantly opened her eyes and tried to resist Yu's attack but she simply lacked the strength to counter it in an instant she was pierced through by yiu sword Aura after killing little black the space continued to collapse but this time it opened up a new space unlike the previous occasions Yi Wu unexpectedly said is it another space change it seems we are getting closer to the core of the dream Alisa recognized The Familiar scenery and said this place resembles Black's Consciousness world after a while they were taken to a cemetery the Tom Stones bore the names of Lil black but in English YW asked in amazement a cemetery Alisa replied this is the deep landscap within her mind as they approached a coffin they suddenly heard a noise coming from it Alisa said said is she perhaps inside there yugu said is there any need to ask the arrangement is too clear it's time to wake up black how much longer do you want to sleep as she spoke Yi wo opened the coffin lid and little black appeared astonished and said you really made it here Alisa immediately rushed to embrace little black and emotionally exclaimed little black sister I finally get to see you little black immediately said sister this is still a dream Alisa replied I know that it's just that I'm really worried about you little black touched hubbed Alisa and said yes I made you worry she then turned to ye wo and said thanks to you seriously wounding The Immortal ancient god I was able to temporarily regain control of my Consciousness but I can only maintain it for a very short time she fell silent for a moment then said so please kill me that way the immortal ancient God will lose its support returning to the seal Alisa was startled and shouted don't it took so long to meet again why can't we choose a better future little black said it's possible but my soul has long been severely damaged over these past 10 years I have understood that there is no salvation left for me so it's better to end everything here she turned to ywu and said the immortal ancient god can seize my Consciousness at any time there's no time left you wo please you suddenly crossed his arms and with a solemn expression said although I sympathize with your situation I refuse she exclaimed in astonishment why Yu smiled and said I have never been someone who gives up easily moreover your life has just begun it cannot end here because I will completely defeat the immortal ancient god making him submit to me little black looked at Yu without blinking thinking to herself his soul radiates strong confidence in desire not a hint of hesitation or fear he is not pretending to be strong or joking he is truly serious thinking this she said it's time then everything depends on you after Yu finished speaking she gradually began to fade away Alisa exclaimed little black immediately a portal appeared behind them yugu said it seems that behind this door is the end pointing of everything let's go let's save her okay the system announced that the immortal ancient God had been defeated in the dream mission accomplished rewards received buff determination to die significantly reduces damage and abnormal status from curses the soul will not be harmed and damage against the immoral ancient God will be greatly increased duration is unlimited limited only to the seal area substitute puppet legendary item taking one's own destruction as the price to avoid one instance of fatal damage upon entering the gate they officially encountered The Immortal ancient god in a sealed state failer level 500 Yu said we meet again Immortal ancient god you have exerted a lot of effort to try to restrain me before but it was all in vain now changing to another form what good does that do youd better submit soon The Immortal ancient God showed disdain and said just a mere mortal borrowing the power of the Stars daring to boast in front of the Divine you will pay for your your arrogance I will use the cruelest method to kill you release your kind trapped within you and then destroy this entire world all before the power of the ancient god Alisa Was Not Afraid instead she confidently shouted stop talking we will definitely finish you off completely the system announced the opening of the dungeon supplement ceiling area updated Mission defeat the true form of the immoral ancient god in the ceiling area he had just exchanged a few words when he actively Unleashed the death curse disappear mortal as soon as the curse touched the determination to die automatically activated generating an effect that reduced the curses Effectiveness by 99% Alisa exclaimed an astonishment the curse has been split apart Yu was quite surprised by this effect no wonder there's a buff targeting the automatic producing such effective pleasure but we can't let the ancient god play alone Yi Wu immediately created a mini sun and shouted loudly if you were the darkness symbolizing death then let the light dispel It Burn It Away Min Sun seeing a blazing son rushing towards him he was terrified and screamed impossible how can a mere mortal possess such power after the Collision the ancient god seemed to have vanished Alisa said so impressive in an instant you dealt with the ancient god leaving no chance for me intervene yigu frowned and said seriously no it's not over yet indeed he hasn't died he is gradually regenerating his body truly The Immortal ancient god he expressed pride and said you can manipulate star power so freely it seems I underestimated you but even star obsession can't kill the God of destruction what can a half measure like you do tentacles began to emerge under their feet wrapping tightly around Alisa exclaimed in panic the curse has transformed into a motionless entity YW shouted is it a technique at this level I can before she could finish speaking the ancient god used a second move and shouted I will not give you a chance to Counterattack take my strongest blow Eternal reincarnation The Immortal ancient god shot a beam of attack the two of them but this beam did not directly attack instead it took them inside a strange passage you would asked in astonishment what the hell is this place where's the immortal ancient god Alisa said it's over this is The Reincarnation artifacts power of the immortal ancient god Eternal reincarnation as soon as she finished speaking a legion of Reaper emissaries wielding s is began advancing straight towards the two of them the living should not exist in this world death is the true immortality as they approached yiu swung her sword decapitating each one but Alisa showed no reaction and let them strike her y wo seeing this exclaimed in horror Alisa immediately mediately embraced her while chopping down the Reapers and shouted what's wrong with you why are you fighting back Alisa desperately said it's useless there's no way out of here no hope the only outcome of Life fear is death going into reincarnation everything is annihilated Yu asked how do you know these things Alisa said I don't remember it must be something that was implanted in my head during kasa's experiments right perhaps little black is correct we fundamentally can't kill the ancient God we can only sacrifice her as Yu was talking someone dared to disturb them and was immediately hit with a palm strike and said it's not the time to give up yet no matter how powerful it is it's merely a defeated subordinate of the shadow of the Stars a reincarnation tunnel I'll break it for you to see Yi Wu while using a Counterattack skill said even if all beings perish the star remains shining eternally I will not enter reinar Nation immediately y Wu opened a hole to escape Alisa joyfully said you've surpassed the concept of life and death forcefully breaking the rules of reincarnation incredible suddenly Yu reached out her hand towards her and said once you make up your mind don't easily give up trust me I will definitely create a satisfying ending everyone will be happy Alisa suddenly remembered a fragment of a lost memory father what if we fail I'm scared be good Don't Be Afraid father will definitely create a beautiful world where everyone can be happy Alisa then said so that's how it is finally I remember now Yu asked in Surprise what is it she said at that time Kos had not yet fully grasped the power of the immortal ancient god the Hasty experiment naturally ended in Failure to salvage the results of the experiment or perhaps because he still held some Humanity within he used his last Trump cards y woo you must defeat the immortal ancient god capture caos and fight him tell them that I do not appreciate him at all not even the words he once spoke count what kind of hero are you you are not worthy to be a father as Alisa spoke she gradually began to fade away in the space and soon transformed into a Divine sword severing immortality became a Divine weapon able to slay the immortal ancient god feler which could eliminate the immortality of the ancient god and simultaneously alleviate the spiritual corrosion of the ancient god y Wu exclaimed in Surprise is this the Divine sword of cows so it turns out C seit within Alisa's body so that she could live on but this also caused him to lose his mental stability gradually leading to Alisa's fall I will definitely fulfill her wish it is time to end this y Wu immediately wielded the Divine sword and broke free from the cycle of reincarnation leaving the ancient god in great astonishment how is this possible could could he truly break my eternal reincarnation it can't be absolutely impossible as heu charged out he swam The Sword and shouted loudly the word impossible does not exist in my dictionary prepare yourself to welcome true death The Immortal ancient god Fator upon seeing the sword was horrified and exclaimed that is the sword without giving the ancient god any time to react the Divine sword severing immortality was brought down by ywu with an overwhelm ing Force this is the will of the pupil the ancient god lost his immortality and instantly disintegrated into dust it can't be I can't be killed Impossible The Immortal ancient god felet was slain the core of the immortal ancient god felet even though he was an immortal ancient God would still face his own death within the magic Crystal seals his last remaining will activated the stone allowing the power of the immortal ancient god to be utilized the aura of the Supreme and the invisible Golden Aura contained within still held some kind of mysterious power an essential material for the Divine level Resurrection potion this is exactly what Yu needs to save M he secretly thought that's great this time the resurrection materials are enough moai can be saved although the battle has ended there is still an ancient god in the east region the ancient god that makes oay feel fear what is it Yi Wu quickly picked up little black it seems that this place won't hold out much longer we have to leave quickly suddenly the Gateway opened vwoo I've opened the exit you all hurry out hearing the happy voice it was sui she has helped me with something big Yu walked out cooly never expecting to be the final winner but he sensed something and turned back after a moment are you still here after the immortal ancient god disappeared has the soul been freed C stood there and replied but it won't be long until it disappears he pondered and continued clearly sacrificing so much the outcome whether Reviving the dead or opening up the future for Humanity has failed if I had met you in the Dream from the beginning would the outcome have been different Yu responded very difficult although it's an illusion it perfectly restores each person's personality as long as the obsession in your heart doesn't change in the end it will turn into a mad scientist committing a series of unforgivable crimes chaos also agreed that's right in the end I still haven't accomplished anything that can be protected Yu laughed well not necessarily aren't we safely here the last remnants of your personality thanks to her I was able to defeat the immortal ancient god by the way she asked me to convey this to you she doesn't appreciate you at all because you don't keep your word this father hasn't succeeded cows hearing his daughter's reproach felt sad Alisa yeu Ste through through the teleportation gate their lives will Mark today as a dividing line moving forward while you shall stop here farewell once a hero cows he smiled contentedly well take care hero Upon finishing his words the space around him began to collapse in the southwest region at the main Treatment Center of hanmo group mod zun long was anxious is there still no news from y wo liai looked at his watch after entering the east region the signal has been cut off and there has been no news until now is it possible that something unexpected happened to them shut up can this fat stinky guy say anything better why are you still here like this Mo zun long spoke up since we learned that we are about to face the east region many of our colleagues have fled you however have chosen to stay why is that he replied immediately either way if y wo fails the entire southwest region is doomed rather than becoming a Sur to the east region it's better to take a big gamble just like when we turned over Guang Jen back then Mo Zen L pondered that's true we are already tied to Yu's fate regardless of whether he succeeds or not I and the hanmo group will stand firmly with him however just waiting like this makes me anxious I long to fly to the east region right away K misses her son too much and if it means bringing her back to Consciousness I'm Willi to pay with my life at that moment a voice rang out so what if you do if ke wakes up and sees that her father is no longer here how do you expect me to explain that hearing this voice everyone turned in unison this voice belongs to ywu who walked in along with moan Long's son sorry to keep everyone waiting he quickly took out a gift Mo zun long was stunned is this the Divine Revival potion yes hurry and give it to her better let you do it I'm too nervous to handle it TR truly there's no help from me y Wu approach to give ke her medicine from within her Consciousness moai saw an Angel flying towards her is this the special effect of the Divine level potion the angel lifted her up how Divine this image was at that moment she gradually opened her eyes and sought the person she loved right in front of her more specifically yiu was holding her in his arms Yu said so you're awake now Kai instantly she wrapped her arms tightly around y woo joyfully burying her head into his sturdy body with tears in her eyes Kai said Thank You y woo I'm back now Yu smiled brightly welcome back everyone present witnessed this miracle they were all overjoyed and speechless great Kai welcome back Yu said all right all right KY has just resurrected and is still very weak let her rest first Mo zun long complied okay immediately take ke back to her room arrange for 10 people to take turns caring for her M draped an arm around yo little brother-in-law this time it's truly thanks to you who else but you could do this ywu shy laughed haha I'm still young I'm not thinking about marriage just yet Mo zun long bowed his head if we said that before the hand Mo group and you were in a Cooperative relationship now we truly cannot part with you any longer after after the two major regions unite we will have to rely on your leadership even more he spoke harshly and I was only doing what I should besides the east region hasn't been entirely taken yet Mo zun long wondered is there really still a resistance after Yi Wu captured the immortal ancient god most of the forces in the east region surrendered and the few strong factions were persuaded by kuu Yi therefore in reality the east region is now under our control but there is still a hidden danger which is the last ancient god of the east region mun long question is that ancient god very difficult to deal with is it more powerful than the immortal ancient god yiu explained it is not difficult to deal with but it is very peculiar he did not understand what he meant by peculiar the sea shifted to the east region in a certain tunnel where yiu and hu yui were present is this the ancient god why is it so small who you ye explained compared to other ancient gods this is indeed a mini type I also reviewed the documents left by oai and Monger to learn about its existence this ancient God has always been in a deep sleep the research Society on Mystic techniques has spent a lot of time without being able to grasp its appearance so the fear stems from the unknown no one dares to awaken it recklessly Yu asked further when was this ancient god discovered she opened the screen according to the displayed documents the search team was formed after the east region was established and discovered it however the records indicate that it first appeared several hundred years before the Earth underwent all transformation hearing this yiwu was stunned what who are you ye continued to provide more information this ancient God has been sleeping beneath the Earth for hundreds of years until it was discovered it showed no signs of waking up scientists in the east region tried to study it but within a day everyone who had with the ancient god died mysteriously she lowered her voice as if to emphasize the strange details and the ways they died were bizarre some were shot to death like a bee's nest others had thousands of arrows piercing their hearts and some were burned to ashes no two deaths were alike since then this ancient God has been completely sealed and has become the deepest taboo of the east region no one dares to mention it anymore that is all the information I have yugu pondered for a moment moment and said that sounds really frightening the events before the O transformation of Earth surpass my understanding but you must know more since you are a guest from another planet before the O transformation of Earth with that Yu called Nana asking her to come for more information as soon as she arrived Nana showed her displeasure Master why did you call me in such a hurry is there something wrong y Wu replied do you want to see the condition of this ancient god you don't look very happy Nana turned around soaking as she said it's because someone didn't keep their promise you promised me you promised to help me reclaim the home planet but it hasn't been done yet of course I'm angry hemp yigu sighed thinking to himself oh this child is soaking again he then tried to appease her how could I forget it's just that I've been too busy lately but I always remembered in my heart as soon as I finish my work here I'll go with you right away okay at this moment nah finally calmed down all right then I temporarily forgive you after that Yu led her to the place of the ancient god he pointed at the object in front of them take a look at this Nana curiously asked this large coffin let me see what's inside saying that she shot a laser beam towards the chamber containing the ancient god upon seeing it she gasped and shouted how can this bastard be here yiwu was astonished and asked Nana do you know this ancient god moreover why does it look like you Nana answered seriously there is a reason for that it is the monster that invaded my home planet which I sealed and expelled myself in the past I absorbed its power to become the mechanical Empress but how did it end up on Earth Yu was taken aback and asked again what what is going on Nana began to recount it must start from before I became the mechanical Empress at that time my Planet had not experienced War for many years although I yearned to become the strongest Warrior every day I could only do tedious transport work she paused for a moment and continued until one day while I was transporting goods a sudden explosion hurled me away at that moment I was still dazed not understanding what was happening when I looked back I finally saw the one who had just attacked me she spoke in a solemn tone it was the ancient god Yu was curious so what happened next nanak continued her voice cold he said something I could never forget those without a body like you have only two choices surrender this planet or be crushed by War yiu listened intently feeling tense Nana emphasized although it was a threat I Was Not Afraid at all on the contrary I felt incredibly excited I immediately charged at him and shouted I cannot let you achieve your goal Nana laughed lightly as she recalled at that time instead of fear I felt more exhilarated I was fed up with logistical work compared to peace I craved battle more he shook his head upon hearing this they can give himself so it turns out Nana has always liked the feeling of fighting so much Nana continued her eyes shining with pride even though the enemy was very strong our planet's Army mobilized all its forces to participate the battle was long and extremely fierce in the end I faced the ancient god directly in that battle I absorbed his power which allowed me to achieve a spectacular Victory she smiled gently thanks to that outstanding performance in battle I have stood out and gradually become the empress Nana continued her voice dropping but this ancient god can only be defeated not completely killed in the end we had to separate its body in Consciousness then push its body into space we never expected it to drift to Earth who are you ye upon hearing this couldn't help but think I did didn't expect Nana's home planet to have such a connection with this ancient god a being that could plunge an entire high-tech Planet into war is truly formidable he pondered for a moment and then made a decision it seems that to completely subdue it I must take a trip to planet m79 after saying this Yu turn to Nana Nana bring this containment chamber onto the ship we will go to your planet together hearing this Nana couldn't hide her Joy really that's amazing at that moment hu y stepped forward staring intently at the containment chamber and spoke Le woo although you have much experience dealing with ancient gods you still need to be cautious this time if just the body of this ancient God has such strange effects I can't even imagine how terrifying its complete state will be y Wu nodded in response yes I understand I will be careful no matter what tricks it has it can't stop me from achieving my goal who all you ye shook her head gently don't just think about the goal sometimes preserving your life is the most important thing the next morning at the safety zone number two airport Moi appeared to see Yi Wu off to the plane she spoke with a tone full of regret vwoo are you really leaving so quickly it was so difficult for me to be reborn I haven't even had the chance to thank you or talk to you more her father and brother stood behind her continuously cheering her on y Wu gently held Ken's hand his gaze soft as he said when I return I will definitely spend more time with you okay KY nodded replying in a gentle voice filled with anticipation yes I'll wait for you sister who are you standing nearby saw this scene and smiled exclaiming what a beautiful youth meanwhile Sha Chan could not hide his concern asking ywu but do you really want to fly to the Sun to absorb energy it sounds sounds too dangerous yiu laughed replying calmly the version has been updated now I don't need to face the sun directly anymore after saying this Yu switch to the star host account a dazzling burst of light appeared as he created a mini sun in the palm of his hand Yu shouted the sun is in my hand witnessing this scene Nana could not contain her excitement exclaiming wow Master is so cool immediately y Wu use the mini sun to charge the energy for Nana's spaceship the bright light spread everywhere making the atmosphere hot Nana complained lightly creating a sun is indeed amazing but it's too hot suu standing nearby instantly used ice magic to cool the space down while y Wu reminded everyone everyone should step back a bit shortly after the system announced energy recharge complete the teleportation gate is now open Yu turn to n and said let's go Nana Nana nodded vigorously yes the two jumped onto the spaceship the spaceship Shone brightly heading straight towards Nana's home planet beginning a New Journey behind them Kai watched the spaceship Fade Away Whispering safe travels y wo the spaceship of Yi Wu and Nana continued to fly at high speed inside the space tunnel heading straight toward Nana's Planet Master everything is still normal we made maintain our current speed and continue to move forward after a while Nana shouted joyfully I see the exit we're coming out after emerging from the tunnel their spaceship finally reached its destination Yu looked around astonished is this the home planet of Nana the m79 planet Nana felt incredibly emotional her eyes glistening with tears I'm finally back suddenly an announcement rang out from the spaceship warning warning the enemy's surveillance satellite has locked onto the target y Wu exclaimed in shock what immediately the m79 air defense system targeted them without any hesitation in an instant laser beans were fired toward their spaceship quick Dodge Nana shouted her eyes wide open have we been detected so quickly Yu hurriedly activated the stealth mode the spaceship immediately became invisible but before they could move far the infrared system had already scanned them the announcement rang out again stealth mode has been disabled Nana shouted in Anger damn it after hundreds of years the technology of the home planet has surpassed this fighter jet by so much at that moment Yu switched to the fighter pilot account and said let me handle him Master Yi Wu confidently stated that the shortcomings of the spaceship would be compensated by the Pilot's skills immediately yiu took the driver's seat and began to Showcase their ability ities just ahead countless laser beams surged toward the spaceship however with exceptional skills y Wu easily dodg them all NaNa witnessing this happily exclaimed Master is so impressive dodged them all Yu shouted charge right in as they burst inside they spotted a gigantic Cannon Planet level preparing to fire damn it this is bad that's the planet destroying main Cannon y Wu exclaimed master quickly get out of the way before they could react the cannon fired unleashing an incredibly terrifying attack that heavily damaged Yu spaceship one of its wings was Bown to pieces and caught fire then plunged straight down to the surface of Planet m79 relying on their skills Yu managed to land safely fortunately both of them emerged unscathed from the wreckage Yu looked around and said regardless we have landed safely but the combat damage is quite sever n said the prison of the ancient god is very secure there's no problem but the crucial transfer device is broken to repair it we need special components I'm afraid they can only be found in the Royal City hearing that yiu was quite curious and asked Royal City is that where you lived before yes Nana exclaimed determinedly this time I must reclaim my throne and personally crush the betrayers so they know the consequences of betraying the mechanical empress yiu gently patted her head and said of course we shouldn't show Mercy to the betrayers but remember not to get too excited don't forget we still need to find the spirit of the ancient god Nana playfully replied Oh Nana knows that y Wu switch to the ambassadorial account of the engineering expert mosai and asked his assistant what level is the power of those here can we crush them the assistant replied the technological level of this planet is much higher than Earth's but compared to the mad mosai it's just Child's Play completely inadequate for comparison hearing this yiu joyfully said then it's easy we'll strike straight at their Lair and finish early to return early just then suddenly a mechanical Army appeared surrounding them and a voice rang out daring to say we are Child's Play what an arrogant tone a person named Ida appeared belonging to the mechanical tribe level 270 she approached and said stranger who are you why have you intruded upon my territory if you do not wish to die then reveal your names Nana immediately responded ridiculous this is the territory of my Empress your invading gang prepare to be completely exterminated today upon hearing that Ida exclaimed in panic you you must be Queen Alina right finally you have returned the surrounding followers shouted in unison it is Majesty the queen Nana put on a silly face and asked who are you you talk as if you know me well they all knelt down to pay their respects and Ida continued it is I your most loyal servant Ida Nana questioned in astonishment is it really you Ida y woo asked curiously an old acquaintance Nana replied Ida is a friend who grew up with me since childhood after I ascended the throne as empress she also became my close mate but she didn't look like this before she pointed to the image above and explained this is Ida's former face this is already the eighth body that I have transformed to survive we must adapt our bodies to be more suited for combat Nana worded said who are you fighting against what on Earth happened while I was gone haa then recounted of course it's the new Empress who else could it be since the moment you were falsely accused and exiled she began to implement her so-called new policies at first it was manageable although it was nowhere near urine but at least it had some semblance of humanity but I don't know why one day she suddenly seemed to go mad starting to impose tyranny producing a mass of killing machines slaughtering the people who opposed her those who survived were forced into hard labor living a life worse than death I along with a group of like-minded individuals established a resistance Army to overthrow the tyranny of the new Empress but the gap between us is just too vast in a direct confrontation we're completely outmatched many comrades have sacrificed their lives and those who remain can only scatter to engage in Guerilla tactics but even so I have never thought of giving up I believe that one day you will surely return to save us after a long wait it was finally not in vain I have found you again Nana was deeply moved exclaiming Ida you have truly endured so much over the years now let me take care of everything Ida was moved to tears and said Majesty nanao was extremely angry Ang r at this moment grinding her teeth and shouting I will definitely kill that [ __ ] with my own hands making her pay a 100 a th000 times for what she has done after hearing Ida recount the whole story Nana turned around and said let's go we will charge into Royal City and Crush that woman Ida exclaimed joyfully great brothers let's move forward with the queen everyone shouted loudly in unison suddenly Yi Wu intervened wait you are about to face the entire planet charging in without any plan aren't you afraid of falling into a trap Nana looked confused and replied uh it seems so seeing that Yu was obstructing them AA stepped forward and said wait a minute I have been very curious who are you to speak to the queen like that it's too disrespectful other subordinates also Express their indignation shouting capture him kill him on the spot y woo then asked Nana so may I ask asked how should I speak to someone like that your highness the noble Queen Nana was quite flustered then tried to explain to everyone wait everyone don't be Hasty Yu is my master as she was speaking n suddenly realized that something was off and she stopped thinking to herself if I call that person my master in front of everyone my Noble image will definitely be completely shattered what should I do what should I do she wondered seeing the perplexed Expressions on everyone's face Nana immediately pulled yiu aside and whispered Master this is my planet after all please give me some face yigu smiled and replied all right just refer to me as your ally remember to listen and not act recklessly yes after Consulting with ywo nas solemnly introduced I forgot to introduce you all this is y wo my Ally whom I met on another planet thanks to him I was able to return here whether in battle or strategy you can trust him Ida hurriedly stepped forward and bowed to Yu so that's the case please forgive my previous rudess yiu said it's all right we just arrived here and are completely unaware of the current situation on this planet do you have any information AA replied of course our self-rescue forces have been fighting for hundreds of years and have gathered most of the information about the enemy she said first is the Royal weapon Factory which operates 24 hours a day continually producing many of the Queen's Royal Guards the weakest among them has a power level above 200 they have no thoughts of their own only obey the Queen's orders they are the most loyal beings and even if we eliminate one batch the next will immediately arrive their numbers never dwindle and even if we break through the guard's defenses next we must face four individuals under the Queen's command each of them possesses immense strength and skill wielding different special abilities although they do not often appear outside the Royal City once we encounter them it will surely be a violent battle and ultimately we must confront the current mechanized Queen to be honest I have only seen her once during the coronation ceremony but just one glance left me feeling utterly terrified my body nearly paralyzed Majesty may not know but in fact during the coronation there was an assassination attempt many soldiers loyal to her launched a suicide attack on the queen Nana was extremely astonished and asked is that true what was the outcome AA continued to recount they managed to break through multiple layers of defenses and rushed to the Queen's side swords and bullets piercing through her body although they were ultimately killed by the Queen's guards they completed their mission and had no regrets it was supposed to be like that but the next day the queen appeared intact she had truly resurrected Nana exclaimed in astonishment what is it a substitute Ida replied we are certain it is the Queen the reason we discovered after countless investigations and sacrifices was that the key lies in the Queen's core a core that contains a replica of her Consciousness as long as the core remains alive the queen will be immortal no matter how many times she is killed she can use the core to change her body Resurrection occurs instantly Nana filled with anger said that woman truly devised such a scheme how Troublesome yiwu stroked his chin thoughtfully and said the mechanical Clan is indeed convenient to say Resurrection is resurrection but normally this wouldn't be very common otherwise if Resurrection were endless what would be the point of fighting AA continued as you mentioned the queen has three cores hidden and Secret locations on the planet one is deep within the weapon Factory mentioned earlier requiring traversal through complex mazike passages to reach along the way there are guards and various traps getting there is not an easy task she said the second one is hidden in the main control room of the annihilation Cannon this place is not only guarded by many soldiers but the external surveillance is as harsh as hell the steel Fortress Is indestructible and the door is made of super hard Alloy on the Fortress there are 20 cannons that can fire continuously without stopping for an hour without the Queen's orders just approaching it would engulf you in Endless reign of gunfire the final core is hidden on the lowest level of the Soul life Library YW asked in Surprise where is this Soul Library AA replied it is the place that preserves and Records the consciousness of every living being on this planet it is both a library storing our information and the largest graveyard on this planet the end point of all life is there but I have only heard of it never been there to reach that place means you have stepped into death hearing this yiu was extremely astonished thinking to himself so does the robot also have a soul I thought only the higher beings did it seems that this place Harbors Secrets I am yet unaware of meanwhile nanao was overwhelmed by the massive amount of information the weapon Factory the control room the library oh what should we do AA then asked Majesty what should we do next na immediately passed it to yiu well let's listen to the Alley's plan y Wu felt helpless with this girl inwardly sighing what kind of Queen are you all right yiu began to lay out his original plan I suggest we go to the control room of the anti-ship cannon first it was the one that shot down our ship getting the core and taking Revenge at the same time can be considered killing two birds with one stone Nana exclaimed excitedly great idea let's set off right away however Ida still tried to remind Yu but as I mentioned earlier The Fortress where the control room of the anti-ship Cannon is located has extremely strong defenses it is the most securely guarded place on this planet Yi Wu remained confident speaking as he walked it's fine if you're scared you can stay here Nana and I can go by ourselves Nana immediately ran after y Wu I trust my Lord's judgment I mean my Ally you all should come along as well Ida had no choice but to follow Nana's words if the queen has said so seeing the back of the two people walking away Ida quietly thought the queen venerates him like that what makes this low-level carbon creature from another planet so special is Majesty being deceived by him for Majesty's sake I must be wary of him a few hours later they finally encountered the main gate of the Fortress the gunfire was extraordinarily dense continuous and Relentless AA troops had no chance to retaliate only able to hide behind a large Rock and inform Mana no the Firepower is too strong we can't get out in the control room of the Fortress the commander appeared frustrated saying has it been dozens hundreds of years these rebellious troops still don't know how to give up how dare these primitive beings oppose the great Queen Suddenly at this moment the screen displayed an image of Y woo walking through a rain of bullets this left the commander astonished exclaiming huh there's still someone unafraid of death coming to sacrifice themselves Yu seem to be taking a leisurely stroll in the park completely unfazed just then I Vis appeared and said the highest level equipment has been provided for you attacks under level 200 are just like an itch by the way I want to introduce you to mosi's specialized profession yiu said let's save the introductions for later it's time to give these aliens a little shock from Earth as he spoke yiu placed his hand on the main door immediately the door was disintegrated into tiny pieces at a speed that was hard to leave and in less than a second he could walk in as if entering his own home Ida and her subordinates were horrified exclaiming what Nana's eyes lit up filled with admiration secretly thinking as expected of the master seeing y wo effortlessly destroy the main door they immediately panicked and shouted reinforce the Firepower don't worry about the losses turn him into ashes for me understood just like that countless Firepower was Unleashed aimed directly at ywu exploding chaotically the destructive force seemed capable of obliterating everything the commander was overjoyed upon seeing this laughing loudly haha let you be proud let you be arrogant low-level carbon based creature vanish beneath my unbeatable Firepower on this side one of yiwu's troops expressed disappointment saying this is the end result of underestimating the opponent Yu is finished Majesty we we should Retreat now Nana however wore an extremely Wicked and confident expression saying you don't understand how could such a Firepower kill Yu she thought indeed ordinary bullets with a level over 200 cannot possibly hurt Yu y Wu had transformed into the Pandora heart form the Steelman he then said this level of Firepower is merely a tickle it's completely insufficient for me the system received enhancements from the planetary environment the Pandora heart began to automatically absorb the surrounding resources to evolve this left y wo quite astonished exclaiming is there really such a good thing the system responded the battle armor has evolved to its ultimate form unlocking many powerful weapons doubling the equipment attributes granting unlimited duration and everlasting durability at this moment yiu was in the Pandora heart state with such a complete Divine weapon this place was akin to Yi Wu's home this thrilled y wo immensely no wonder this planet can unlock the title cane of Realms it can also bring about such a qualitative transformation for my battle armor I can't wait to explore every inch of this planet I Vis then said Master is so cool let's quickly fuse and evolve upon hearing this yiu was taken back quickly dodging and saying fuse what don't cause chaos quickly introduce the professional attributes of the most say crazy account I am immediately said all right okay MOSI was frantic with a specialized profession a supremely ultimate Creator limited by breakthroughs unlocking a new crafting level providing planets Planet level items and Equipment had values and attributes exceeding the Master Level but the necessary materials were extremely demanding only obtainable from the cosmic gifts of the passive Creator which could Grant the mechanical race teammates a substantial boost in attack and defense attributes these items could only be actively used by mechanical units regardless of the material requirements to forcibly upgrade the target to the highest level and forcibly increase their Affinity to a friendly level Planet transformation seen through the essence of planets changing the operational laws of all things and carrying out mechanical transformation from the ground up were part of this skill note that this skill required a large amount of money and materials once activated it would automatically consume resources be cautious when using it this left ywu in great astonishment his mind filled with thoughts the level was even higher than that of the Master Level who would have thought it was only just unlocked now indeed deep in the universe there was technology that far exceeded Earth's civilization regarding the planet transformation we already had a preliminary plan immediately yiu shouted Warriors of the resistance Army follow me to attack as Yu's words ended the passive skill the gift of the creator was immediately activated enhancing the strength of the entire Army oh the power within my body is surging relentlessly it's unbelievable that such low-level carbon creatures could achieve this Nana patted Ida on the shoulder and said I told you so trust him y Wu has never let me down Ida bowed his head looking remorseful Majesty forgive me for doubting your vision immediately Nana led her Army forward and shouted Queen declares you innocent now unleash all your power and anger understood the resistance troops surg forward screaming destroying and annihilating the enemy the morale and fighting Spirit of Nana's Army surged strongly causing the enemy to crumble and fall apart Nana's Army Advanced closely to the center in the command room a soldier rushed in panic to report Commander the resistance is about to attack the commander horrified yelled you useless law a bunch of incompetent fools the layers of barriers have been erected concentrate all remaining forces to protect the Central Command room if we fall that person will surely kill me and you will die with me we absolutely cannot fail although he was a robot he was still sweating profusely scared to the point of almost wetting himself Commander we've detected a high energy response approaching rapidly could it be enemy reinforcements the trembling Soldier said no this identification code is from outside the three of them have reached the data center y asked is the control room for the planet destroying Cannon right ahead idam responded it's almost here thanks to the queen who has restrained most of the Firepower Nana hearing this got excited and laughed keep adoring me more if they go a bit further they'll be stopped by an army Ida was startled looked ahead and said too many people Yu calmly said it's just waiting to die charge through but before they could act a giant robot appeared its name was Mike level 400 upon seeing y woo of the others it showed disdain and said even now you all look like racks in a sewer hiding and making it so I have no place to kill today I can finally Massacre the Realms haha seeing this terrifying robot Nana's Army began to panic exclaiming how can this be how did this ruthless one suddenly appear here we can't win we absolutely can't not defeat him Yu then asked who is this guy Ida stepped forward her eyes filled with Fury emphasizing each word he is one of the Queen's four Guardians ranked second in strength Mike is an exceedingly ruthless bloodthirsty man loyal to the queen only to lawfully kill countless resistant soldiers have died at his hands even my beloved sacrificed himself to protect the regiment's retreat I couldn't even collect his body at this point idida was so Furious that she trembled all over her hands clenched tight wanting nothing more than to tear this man into a thousand pieces Mike appeared to enjoy himself speaking in a mocking tone SOI was yours he was one of the longest serving resistance Fighters and it took a lot of effort to kill him of course I chose the most stimulating way to dismember and crush him seeing the look of Despair on his face was truly a pleasure haha hearing Mike consult her beloved Ida could no longer restrain herself she screamed with rage damn it die for me and launched herself at him she punched Mike repeatedly but her power was far too weak compared to his each punch felt like merely scratching an itch for him with no effect whatsoever Mike grabbed Ida with one hand lifting her high and said coldly you were stronger than your man but before me you were no different from a mechanical ant easily crushed at this rate I will crush you I enjoy it most when you die with coolant and oil gushing out as soon as he finished speaking Mike tightened his grip on Ida to the point where she screamed in agony due to the pain but at that moment a powerful punch like a hammer flew in distorting Mike's face and breaking a tooth Yi Wu quickly helped Ida up anxiously asking are you okay AA struggled to rise rubbing her chest and replied I'm fine thank you for saving me but this is my grudge with him there's no need for an alien like you to intervene ye whooo Shrugged and responded I'm not interested in your grudges I just thought if you die nana will be very sad at that moment Mike was struggling to get back on his feet his face Twisted in pain he smirked maliciously and said very good aside from the senior and the queen you are the first person to make me feel pain to reward you I will grant you the most brutal death among 999 kinds of torture are you ready to die Yu smirked coldly replying sounds interesting but I'm not the one who wants to kill you immediately ywu activated his active skill the Creator's gift enhancing Ida's power he said let me give you a hand Ida exclaimed in Surprise what are you planning to do as Yu's skill was activated all the surrounding matter began to shift and harmonize into Ida's body in an instant she had become a powerful level 450 Warrior even she was incredibly shocked by her trans transformation looking back at herself she exclaimed is this really me after being upgraded to a new form by y wo yay was astonished and hurriedly asked Yu what what have you done to me yiu replied nothing I've just fully unlocked your body's potential now you could be called the ultimate form Mike showed contempt sneering it's just a change in shape what's there to brag about in front of me soon I'll send you to meet your dead man being toyed with repeatedly about the person she loved made Ida extremely angry she instantly Unleashed her power leaping up to punch him causing his mouth to shatter an oil to spray out he yelled out loudly do you want to die then he launched an attack towards Ida but she easily dodged too slow Ida said then delivered a powerful kick to Mike the force was so strong that he was sent flying away she continued to fire a barage of shots at him creating a horrifying explosion this blow seriously injured him but it still wasn't enough to take him down Mike strouble to rise his eyes filled with Fury saying am I really hurt by a little bug like you he said no way I am the second master under the queen how could I lose to a weak machine like you strength I need much more strength he was unwilling to accept this and immediately transformed into a new form one that was more massive larger and more powerful at this moment Aida looked like an ant in front of him which made him extremely excited come here this time I will crush you completely with that he launched an attack at Ida but still could not harm her after dodging the blow Ida immediately counterattacked and shouted this is your ability the power of absorption countless Warriors of the resistance have been ruthlessly killed by you absorbed and even their bones no longer remain today we will take revenge for them Mike still showed disdain and asked is it just you right after that the fists of both faced each other the tremendous force made the surrounding space seem about to shatter Ida's arm endured the powerful backlash causing mechanical parts to fly off but Mike also suffered considerable damage his arm was completely incapacitated making him Panic how how is it possible without giving him a chance to catch his breath Isa continued to launch her attack go to hell Mike this strike of hers was truly devastating the immense power enough to make his body gradually disintegrate at this moment he could only let out a wretched scream have I really lost no way no way just like that one of the Queen's four guards was eliminated Nana exclaimed with joy well done Ida Ida also expressed her happiness if it weren't for majesty and your allies I definitely couldn't have done it alone the subordinates cheered you did it you succeeded finally you've Avenged the boss that's great really great but within those mechanical corpses there was something that caught Yu's attention he approached one of the corpses then smiled a frightening smile causing Mike even on the brink of death to break out in a cold sweat yiu stared at him and thought to himself in front of the crazy mosai this kind of mind transfer can completely hide itself at this moment Nana ran over and asked vwo what are you doing Ida said she wanted to thank you very much I Ida continued this gratitude cannot be expressed in words if you need anything just say it I will definitely do my best to help Yi Wu gently squeezed the neck of the mechanical fake corpse then turned back to Ida and said not so fast you should destroy this thing first upon hearing that she immediately fired a laser to destroy the body but kept the head intact for it to roll around it turned out that he was indeed the mic from earlier while no one was paying attention he had transferred the data to another mechanical body he thought to himself damn it I have to quickly move to a farther Place what's happening why can't I move yiu responded surprised that you can't transfer because I have blocked your transfer ability he shouted loudly how could this happen do you think opposing the queen will end well for you all of you must die so noisy y Wu delivered a crushing kick eliminating him Mike received 3 million experience points the mosta account frantically learned the data transferability the data transfer Consciousness sounds a lot like the core backup consciousness of the queen did the queen Grant Mike this ability then do the other guards have this ability as well Nana urged guwu quickly take the core to avoid reinforcements y Wu said don't worry there won't be any reinforcements upon hearing this Nana was quite surprised Yu explained as soon as I came in here I set up an energy barrier outside completely cutting off signals between this Fortress and the outside world Nana couldn't help but exclaim no wonder you were the master really trustworthy AA then asked Master what do you mean Nana hurriedly explained it's an abbreviation for the main leader on Earth they often call it like that at this moment all the remaining soldiers inside had knelt down and surrender we surrender please spare Our Lives heidis said you know how to recognize the situation saving us quite a bit of effort the captain replied even Mike has been defeated I would be foolish to resist you after that they began to venture deeper inside to find the core Ida operated the computer opened a door to the basement and said according to the information the hidden entrance should be here it's opened Nan exclaimed in astonishment could this be the energy framework of the planet destroying Cannon as they stepped down they saw an incredibly powerful energy source working continuously Nana said I didn't expect that woman had a backup Consciousness here just a little carelessness could turn us to dust y w thought to himself so the planet destroying Cannon utilizes the energy of the planet to replenish its energy no wonder it is so powerful suddenly the system rang out again announcing that one of the necessary conditions for terraforming the planet had been completed the exploration of the planet's core energy now the energy of this planet could be used for terraforming energy yiu was extremely excited feeling joyful within he thought to himself another achievement in Exploration must it be so sudden so unexpected after discovering that he could use the planet's energy for terraforming y Wu immediately ask his assistant a vis if I want the plan for large scale energy core what tools do I need I Vis replied I think this Ultra compressed energy storage device will definitely suit you you can use it to automatically collect all the energy before ywu were six energy compression machines enough to hold the energy of an entire planet I Vis curiously asked Master what do you plan to do with so much energy Yu answered for now it's a secret you'll know very soon Ida then asked Yu what to do with the planet destruction Cannon should we destroy it yiu immediately used his mechanical management skills and said it would be a waste to destroy it I'd rather keep it for my own use seeing the scene before them Nana and her companions were utterly astonished the planet destruction Cannon program is being reinitialized y woo what has he done he has gained control y Wu immediately said I have gained control of the planet destroying Cannon and have discovered something else huh what is that Discovery nay asked you'll find out soon enough Yu replied with that they continued their journey to find the Queen's backup core while moving Nana said this place is so vast it's really easy to get lost if we're not careful Yi Wu responded the structure of the entire planet destroying weapon is under my control so there's no need to worry about going the wrong way he then pointed in a direction said that's it the core the Queen's backup Consciousness upon hearing this Nana joyfully exclaimed the core the backup Consciousness is indeed an unexpected Harvest it's so cunning to be hidden in such a secretive place but how could it escaped the eyes of its Master Ida then ordered the soldiers to shoot it fire after a series of shots the core was still unharmed they were all astonished exclaiming it hasn't been damaged at all why also Express surprise in this world there exists a metal so tough that even I have never encountered it ye wo thoughtfully said to be precise it's not that it's tough but its self-repairing speed is disturbingly fast y Wu thought to himself if it cannot be destroyed immediately it will likely recover to its original state in an instant indeed it is a magnificent item perfectly suitable for use in designing the defensive perimeter of my safe Zone to create the most solid line of defense suddenly yiu was startled thinking this residual Consciousness carries the aura of the ancient god Soul m Master this can be purified and used to enhance Nana's strength I speculate that if we gather all three parts of the residual core Consciousness Nana May regain her Peak power enough to confront the mechanical Queen now IIs explained hearing this Yu appeared satisfied thinking good idea after all this trip is to avenge Nana ultimately it should be her who finishes it I will only support her then Yu said so let's put it away in the pouch for now now I have obtained one of the three residual cores of the queen I leave the purification work to you I will continue the purification work from behind it might take some time please be patient what we spent decades achieving y woo you accomplished upon your arrival you must be sent by the mechanical God to help us as long as we have y wo we are not afraid of anything next they proceeded to deal with the soldier Factory the morale of the group was incredibly High however Yu still chose a safe strategy he slowly analyzed the number of enemies in the soldier Factory is too large it will definitely be a difficult battle if we want to avoid many losses it is best to be fully prepared therefore Yu decided to go to the soul Library first according to descriptions it is a very mysterious place and he felt that there was something that made him think after a while their group arrived at the soul Library a metallic Cube floating in the air so this this is the soul Library it's so quiet too silent it's really strange why is there no entrance and there are no guards at all Majesty do you know anything the structure here is completely different from before Nana wondered Yu discovered a robot lying still there so he approached and said hey stop pretending to be dead get up I have a few questions to ask you the robot remains silent but how could it fool the engineering Ambassador like MOSI still want to pretend fine just when I'm in need of a mechanical pet I will take you as material for modification don't move or else if I accidentally damage an important part I won't be responsible immediately the robot came to life stepped back and shouted in panic stop stop stop your actions violate article 213 of the mechanical convention I won protest he replied the protest is ineffective the convention of your kind cannot govern human like me I say it can be governed then it can be governed a tiny human dares to contradict me I see you we tired of living so come and experience the Superhuman might of the super alloy cator of Landa immediately the sounds of slapped slap rang out fiercely this is too much dozens of you young people attacking a mere robot like me is indeed excessive YW then asked did you not want us to witness your superhuman power it replied mainly I have not not encountered a living person for many years so I am a bit too excited he please follow me over here it s and opened the door to the soul Library beginning to introduce you were the 3,467 guests of the Soul Library please come inside as they stepped inside they immediately saw an incredibly vast space the beautiful scenery resembled the universe and in the center stood a gigantic tree Ida pointed at the tree and exclaimed in panic you all come and look over there the Colossal tree radiated an extremely dazzling golden light beneath its roots lay countless corpses of the mechanical Clan seemingly transformed into nutrients to nourish the tree upon seeing the Towering tree emanating Majestic Brilliance along with the countless corpses of the mechanical Clan they were all extremely astonished exclaiming what on Earth is this it feels like the apocalypse yet it carries a Divine sensation Landa the head librarian began to roduce welcome to the Temple of knowledge where the origins and transformations of our Celestial body are recorded Ida full of curiosity asked are you saying this is the origin of our Celestial body Landa laughed and replied haha let me tell you our Celestial body was initially just a floating core of energy in the universe until the Creator being appeared granting it life hearing this yiu was quite astonished and asked the Creator being who is that have you ever encountered them the head librarian responded no one knows the true appearance of the Creator being even I have only ever heard their voice in The Realm Of Consciousness countless years later the metallic surface of celic core developed self-awareness and from there life was born and flourished the Creator being has long since departed we do not know when our Celestial body began the process of self-evolution from primordial to civilization from peace to war every advancement has accompanied the sacrifice of countless lives the future of our Celestial body is shrouded in chaotic Mist but the Creator being has not abandoned us the golden tree of life has risen from the ground its Divine Radiance bringing New Hope to the world its name is m79 ye Wu immediately asked m79 isn't that the name of this planet the chief librarian replied that's right the tree of life is the last Legacy Left To Us by the Creator and the name of this planet also originates from that the Tree of Life guides the evolution of species and civilizations containing powerful and unknown codes within whenever a civilization evolves to a certain level it receiv receives Enlightenment codes from the Tree of Life to advance to the next version of civilization and the corpses before you were the witnesses to the evolution from version 1.0 to the present of all beings hearing this information yay was extremely confused and turned to Nana to asked is what he said true Nana replied Majesty I have never heard of these things before even a queen has things she does not know but it does sound plausible ye W asked so what version are we currently in the chief librarian responded when the planet evolved to version 99990 the ancient god suddenly appeared completely disrupting the original developmental Rhythm causing everything to become chaotic and disordered although it came at the cost of painful sacrifices under the leadership of the first queen and the Warriors the ancient god was eventually sealed within the planet and from then on we stepped into peace Nana hearing this immediately showed a smug expression and laughed cley the librarian then said it shouldn't have been like that but the energy of the ancient God has caused irreversible pollution to the planet causing the evolution to start drifting away from the guidance of the tree of life therefore even I do not know what this version currently is however based on the observed data it can be seen that it is definitely evolving in a chaotic disorderly version filled with endless Wars y w then asked so is this the reason why Wars are ceaseless nowadays but you were the manager here why are you not evolving your body is still primitive and outdated like this the librarian laughed happily and said haha I am the Glorious Soul Library manager created by the host and entrusted with a noble mission how could I follow such a misguided path therefore I have actively refused to evolve and have maintained the status of version 1.0 until now but after all I am a relic so malfunctions are common to reduce the damage I am pretended to be a scrap out there occasionally waking up to perform a little system maintenance y wo then fist bumped him and said I thought you were just a clown but unexpectedly you've have such loyalty and romance in your heart the head librarian cheerfully said haha you can admire it all you want it's just a legend you would asked again so you are not loyal to the current mechanical Queen the head librarian replied I had anticipated that you would ask this question the only being I have been loyal to from the beginning to the end is the creator if you w't overthrow that mad woman I would be more than willing to help ye will continue to ask then do you know where the Consciousness replica of the queen is it's right there the head librarian indeed answer but the Consciousness replica has been completely digitized merged into the countless data of the tree of life even I cannot summ it what can you do ywu stepped closer to the ancient tree and calmly said just stand there and watch he observed the tree for a moment and thought in himself just as Landa said even M's account cannot distinguish where the Consciousness replica of the queen is just by the naked eye so there is only one way at that moment the body of the mechanical was beginning to revive slowly advancing towards Yu they charged in to attack and Shabad protect the queen Intruder die but before they could even touch y wo they were knocked Away by Ida and Nana they said to harm y wo you have to get past us first the soldiers guarding yiu stood firm in front clearly determined to protect him yiu leave this place to me another Soldier spoke up y Wu approached the base of the tree and said now I will send my Consciousness into the Tree of Life to find the true Consciousness replica my body will be in an unprotected state so while I'm away everything is in your hands the two girls Yu asked for help were incredibly excited just leave it to us Yu placed his hand on the trunk of the ancient tree a blinding flash of light erupted from within sending his Consciousness into it as soon as he opened his eyes he found himself in an incredibly vast space is this perhaps the original form of Planet m79 ye wo wondered I Vis appeared and said Master is correct this place is likely a projection of the data within the tree of life it seems that this place has not evolved into any living beings not even a person to ask for directions so how can we find anything suddenly Yi Wu exclaimed how strange what's wrong master I VI asked did you discover something Yi Wu felt A peculiar sensation clearly this is my first time here yet I have an oddly familiar feeling as if I had been to this place in a dream long ago but the reason is unclear suddenly a voice broke the silence it is only natural for your soul has long sensed this place Yu was startled turned around and asked who is it why do I feel an overwhelming sense of familiarity The Voice belonged to the deranged most high upon appearing he greeted long time no see as for you this is our first meeting but it is already destined that you will be my successor Yu looked at MOSI a character who had appeared quite early but he was only now meeting him face to face it turned out that this planet was created by Him Mosa's sudden appearance left both individuals astonished gasping aren't you supposed to have died a long time ago how can you appear here MOSI Lord is it really you mosa calmly replied the form of life is not only limited to what can see my digital Consciousness has transcended the constraints of the physical body you can encounter the remnants of my Consciousness in any corner of the universe once you fully grasp my power you will be able to do the same Yu smiled and said fully grasp you say although I have obtained your power I still know too little about you could you tell me about yourself MOSI opened the screen and replied of course let me take you back to my past perhaps you will find some answers at first first I was just an ordinary scientist filled with curiosity and a desire to explore the mysteries of the universe one day my Consciousness suddenly resonated with a mysterious power in the universe knowledge flooded into my mind making me feel that my body was filled with infinite energy from that moment on I became both a Creator and a destroyer my ambitions were like a black hole devouring my rationale resulting in the creation of monstrous beings and terrifying warships with technology far beyond Humanity I easily conquered my home planet so effortlessly that I lost interest driven instead by growing ambition and desire I personally buried my homeland and embarked on a journey to conquer the Stars I have created countless planets and I also destroyed countless civilizations this planet is the 79th Planet I created using the nuclear energy from the planet therefore it is named m79 I leave fragments of Consciousness on each planet I create little did I expect to meet you here ywu curiously asked you said I am the hair you chose what does that mean why did you choose me he replied After experiencing countless cycles of creation and destruction I have stood at top the Stars yet I am lost my soul is enveloped by a vast emptiness therefore I have decided to transform my Consciousness into an invisible signal and send it deep into the universe seeking new possibilities in the endless flow of time but first I must completely Bid Farewell to this body at that moment his only friend bandora aimed the gun at his head and asked are you sure you want to do this Moss responded go ahead this is something only you can do I have a feeling that this is not our final farewell we will meet again in another way bandora then said very well we shall reunite when Destiny allows immediately after The Gunshot rang out Moss officially transformed into a being of Consciousness and drifted into the distant Universe when the screen turned off Moss spoke again I am neither a god nor can I predict what will happen after millions of years initially I only hope to find an hair in the form of Digital Life unbeknownst to me I encountered a special existence like you you have not only inherited my power completely but you also possess many other immense Powers however what is astonishing is that you have not fallen into the abyss of power your soul is not the least bit confused not in doubt you are far stronger than I hearing this Yi Wu felt a bit shy and scratched his head saying all of this is thanks to your help many times it was because of you that I was able to overcome dangers Moss activated the system his voice calm Yet full of meaning I am honored to hear you say that now let the remains of my Consciousness help you one last time the queen of this planet has hidden the core of her identity within the endless flow of information of the tree of life if you search with external power even someone as strong as you would spend hundreds of years but what astonished Yu was the sight before him he secretly thought the stars are rotating in a marvelous way could this be the acceleration of time from what seemed to be a mission that would take hundreds of years Moss only took a few minutes to retrieve the core of identity he handed it to ywu and said as the Creator this trivial matter is not worth worrying about Wu accepted it his eyes filled with wonder exclaiming is this truly the backup core of the queen at that moment Moss began to fade away leaving behind only a final message go now I hope you can lead life on planet m79 to prosperity and peace tell them that the creator has never abandoned them although Moss's presence brings both destruction and rebirth Yu understands that all hope now rests in his hands y Wu happily Bid Farewell to him not forgetting to express his gratitude thank you Moss we will do that the system also said me too goodbye Moss I will definitely assist Master y Wu outside Nana and Ido were struggling to confront the core security robots damn it why won't this end they fought while placing their trust in yu Nana said trust Yu he will definitely bring about a transformation just then all the robots suddenly fell down in a strange manner one person exclaimed both surprised and joyful is is it over it must be ywo he has succeeded at the same time the tree of life also began to disappear seeing this scene Landa was moved to tears and exclaimed you you this feeling is it you the great Creator indeed you have always been by my side from the Tree of Life Yu stepped out his voice decisively ringing out everyone I have returned the system at this moment also issued a notification due to contact with the memory fragments of the powerful woss the account has been supplemented with information and unlocked a new title Planet Creator the title is described as Planet Creator is a Transcendent existence among the endless universe not only is he a sculptor of stars but also the enlightener of civilization using infinite intellect and creativity to weave the most brilliant chapters of life in the universe this ability is not about renovation or enhancement but about creating an entirely new planet therefore there is no need for any designs just ensure you have enough materials and you can begin the creation the specific outcome entirely depends on the amount of materials and the creativity of the Creator the necessary materials include the planet's nuclear energy combined with any other substances Weiss excitedly said Master this ability is indeed not to be underestimated at present youve approached the essence of the frenzied Moss infinitely yiu exclaimed in astonishment the power to create a planet is truly extraordinary just as Moss mentioned looking at the Tree of Life slowly fading away y Wu thought to himself unlucky go encountered a fragment of Moss's Consciousness otherwise as he said it would take hundreds of years to Discover It reflecting on it is indeed chilling Yu silently expressed his gratitude thank you Moss I hope we have the chance to reunite in the mechanical Royal Court the mechanical Queen syia Sera at level 499 still did not realize she had lost two important items when a subordinate hurriedly rushed into to report she coldly said another group of rebels which punts are causing trouble this time the subordinate immediately replied your majesty it's still the same Rebel Army from before they are causing unrest in the outer ruins selia Sera immediately asked so it's them a bunch of cockroaches what's there to report the subordinate trembling with fear stammered because they have attacked the main control room of the star destroying Cannon and the Soul Library moreover both facilities have been breached upon hearing this she instantly flew into a rage grabbing her subordinate's head and shouting useless fool why didn't you report earlier the subordinate quickly explained his voice shaking they blocked the signal we only received new news when the attack began even Mike has been defeated please spare my life your majesty without any hesitation she crushed his head without a hint of remorse after that she shouted they attacked both places simultaneously this can't be a coincidence could it be they know my secret furthermore even Mike has been defeated is there someone secretly helping the Rebels the image of Nana Nana suddenly flashed in her mind she broke out in a sweat thinking it be her no she should have died a long time ago it absolutely cannot be her but if it's not her then who after a moment of contemplation she ordered her subordinates you two immediately set out and eliminate the rebels it's best to capture two of them alive for interrogation report to me immediately in case of any situation the subordinates obeyed and quickly departed as you command at this moment in the weapons Factory where the core of identity of the queen was hidden alarm Bells rang loudly signaling the detection of multiple unidentified entities approaching hurry up hurry up everyone assemble a commander shouted loudly the entire Army here has gathered completely do these useless Rebels dare to come here to die with our equipment and numbers it only takes one kick from each person to trample them it seems they have reached a dead end and lost their minds clawing wildly later when the door opens everyone should exert their strength to wipe them out completely the soldiers responded in unison understood as soon as the door opened a legion of ywo zombie mechs unexpectedly charged in first shocking everyone what the hell is this since when did the rebels possess such a force despite the surprise they remained calm and shouted but no matter how many they are they're just a pile of useless junk in terms of Firepower we still hold the advantage attack fiercely at that moment YW stealth aircraft also appeared flying around the battlefield from inside the aircraft Ida exclaimed excitedly finally we have entered the weapons Factory the operation we have always dreamed of is finally being carried out easily Nano was extremely indignant the soldiers and the weapons produced in bulk here compared to what she once knew had been updated through many generations however they had no aesthetic appeal whatsoever she thought to herself these wasteful criminals are truly detestable as soon as they flew into position the cloaking mode was disabled revealing a gigantic spaceship its sudden appearance startled the soldiers who shouted in panic what enemies where did they come from the three y woo immediately doed down quickly handling the entire group of soldiers and advancing deeper inside the factory Ida exclaimed in amazement this is the innermost part of the weapons Factory the Queen's Consciousness backup Corp is located here yugu stood behind observing and commenting this place looks like the main control room of the annihilation Canon it also uses planetary energy to provide enormous resources for the factory it seemed that we might be able to gather something else here but the Queen's Consciousness is hidden in a coffin does she have a special preference for that upon hearing this Nana turned around smiling smugly I thought this weapons Factory would be the toughest bone to chew I didn't expect it to be as easy as pie y reminded her with a serious tone don't be overly complacent I still feel that something is off boom indeed just as ye wo finished speaking an unexpected situation occurred the Queen's subordinates appeared one in blue armor named Android Jiminy mcka and the other in red armor named Android jimin fi both at level 390 upon their arrival they mocked what a sharp creature to think you managed to detect us it's a pity we were so close to sending the former Queen a bit further on her journey y Wu calmly corrected you misunderstand I spoke incorrectly but I wasn't implying you at that moment Nana suddenly reacted fiercely she shouted in anger so it's you too two traitors daring to appear before me ye Wu curiously asked are they acquaintances of yours Nana gritted her teeth her eyes filled with Fury these two were originally my closest AIDS personally chosen by me from the finest soldiers they fought alongside me against the ancient god but unexpectedly they betrayed me while I was fighting against that vile Woman They stabbed me in the back causing my humiliating defeat Micha sneered disdainfully coldly replying former Queen your ideals are too outdated you are unworthy to lead this planet only Queen Celia Sera can truly bring hope to this place fuy echoed his tone full of sarcasm you have already died once why bother returning to shame yourself again Ida furiously shouted you ungrateful bastards you're even worse than animals what do you think you were to come at me Nana quickly stopped her coldly saying Ida step back this is something I want to handle myself these two traitors before Nana could finish her sentence they rushed forward to attack one of them laughed mockingly haha the former Queen is still as Nave and adorable as ever don't blame us for overwhelming you with numbers without hesitation NAA launched an attack but they easily dodged it one of them sneered contemptuously too slow too slow with that outdated mechanical body you dare challenge the queen before long Nana was being suppressed by them iida anxiously exclaimed Nana is no match for them y woo help quickly if we attack together they won't stand a chance however Yu only smile smiled confidently replying but nana told us not to interfere this is her personal matter seeing Ida still unconvinced yugu teased this girl Nan and doesn't learn good lessons but is imitating me with the pretend pig to eat the tiger trick to show off huh Ida was surprised and Confused asking what do you mean what are you talking about not wanting Ida to wander for too long Nana quickly transformed and said no wonder you are the master in terms of boasting Nana is still far behind you just let me imitate a little clumsily it's fine the Queen's core Consciousness is released at full power immediately Nana created two gigantic gloves with Incredible speed she rushed towards the two traitors in an instant Nana grabbed their heads so fast that they couldn't react and without hesitation smashed their heads down onto the ground ruthlessly although weak a lean camel is better than a fat horse it was clear that these traitors were no match for her after being slammed hard against the ground the red-haired girl shouted angrily bastards daring to steal the core of the queen Nana with strength at level 460 coldly responded kneel down and beg for mercy perhaps I will let you stay whole traitors however the two girls were not afraid at all they continued to charge forward to attack shouting loudly you despicable one how dare you be so arrogant do you think you were still a queen die die die but their speed was far too slow compared to Nana she easily dodged their attacks and quickly jumped behind them Nana coldly said stubborn and obstinate I have already given you a chance as soon as the words were finished Nana Nana immediately threw a punch at each of them catching them off guard both were sent flying straight into the wall opposite their faces shattered no longer resembling anything Dan Dan it how can I be defeated by you immediately both merged together forming a grotesque shape Mecha love the mafu at level 470 was determined to eliminate all obstacles in the way of the Majesty you must die Ida extremely worried shouted how can this be this power exceeds ours nearly matching the strength of the queen your majesty nana be careful yiwu quickly stopped her saying fall back first don't take risks the two-headed monster immediately lunged forward delivering deadly punches towards Nana the overwhelming attack forced Nana to temporarily defend not daring to Counterattack seeing this the monster became even more excited shouting run run fast weren't you just running around like a fly a moment ago Nana thought to herself this guy has a range of attack that's too large each of his blows seems to carry the weight of millions of tons as soon as the th crossed her mind the monster used the skill millions of rays to attack Nana ha turned to Ash Nana quickly created a defensive energy Shield before the oncoming attack afterwards she coldly said tet don't get too smug this kind of attack I can easily send right back at you the mechanical Queen activated her enhancement mode Nana's two arms transformed into two sharp blades continuously slashing at the two-headed monster this infuriated it as it delivered a strong punched to Nana's stomach and shouted are you crazy this Reckless fighting style is no different from a wild dog Nana immediately counterattacked her eyes shining brightly and replied do you think my fighting style needs your concern with extreme speed Nana slashed at the monster and then jumped behind it Landing in a cool pose this action made the two-headed monster burst into laughter you fool we've already told you and yet you still don't understand what can you do before it could finish its sentence the monster's arm was severed and fell to the ground Nana turned back looked at the monster and smiled saying serves you right look at your foolish appearance the monster angrily retorted so what you're also as injured as I am Nana replied I don't care as long as I can kill you that traitor being a little wounded means nothing significant in her heart Nana thought after all the master Will Repair me anyway Ida anxiously shouted if this continues even if his majesty wins he will be seriously injured and won't be able to endure it I must go help her but Yi Wu stopped her don't rush nana will be fine AA was surprised vwu why are you stopping me Yu replied firmly nana will be all right then he shouted to Nana Nana fight with all your might I will handle everything Nana thought to herself my master must have guessed my thoughts right indeed the weak can defeat the strong did not Escape his eyes then I will hold nothing back and fight with all my strength at that moment Nana truly took the battle seriously and defeated the two-headed monster soon the situation was decided the two-headed monster knelt down on the ground Nana out of breath from exhaustion said Huff Huff I finally won however she also collapsed from fatigue fortunately yiu rushed out to catch her smiling as he said you'd get great Nana replied with a smile of course I am the mechanical Queen how could I lose to this garbage While y wo was repairing Nana Ida ran over joyfully saying his majesty is truly remarkable clearly we are not at the same level as the opponent but still won this time when facing the mechanical Queen we also have hope for victory Nana opened her eyes smiled coldly and said no it is not enough to defeat that guy I must be become even stronger Yi Wu gently patted Nana's head and replied after all this body was created on earth and the durability of the materials surely cannot compare to your planet rest assured I will definitely create a more perfect body for you upon hearing this Nana was delighted her eyes sparkling and she hesitantly asked again really y Wu confidently answered of course she then pretended to be proud curling her lips and saying ah am there's 's no need for that then I'll leave it to you at that moment the two-headed monster only had one head left it stubbornly insisted with a determined voice don't think you have won then it abruptly slammed its head into the wall beside it and then grabbed the coffin shouting you won't get the core here even if I have to use all my strength I will stop you here Nana saw this and B of herself she is charging energy for the coffin y wo startled in his heart realized that they Target was the coffin containing the core in the past even he couldn't see through what exactly was inside hurrying in yiwu shouted loudly don't get cocky but it was too late the coffin suddenly activated unleashing a powerful force that threw IID to outside meanwhile the two-headed monster which had run out of energy was about to shut down completely before it faded entirely it managed to shout one last sentence ha we will wait for you and the world Beyond immed immediately afterward thick clouds of smoke Rose from inside the coffin and behind the smoke the silhouette of a person gradually appeared it seemed that both of them realized something how is this possible as soon as Ida saw the familiar figure she rushed towards him Nana screamed but it was too late Ida don't go but Ida did not listen she happily embraced him and said is it really you I always thought you were dead I never expected but she didn't have time to be happy for long the man immediately grabbed her by the neck and lifted her off the ground this left Ida completely bewildered why have you forgotten me I'm Ida your wife yeu was astonished and asked is that man 's husband if I remember correctly he was killed by Mike Nana replied that's right he was once the strongest General under my command I never expected to meet him here iten level 48 was currently in an enhanced State thanks to the core perhaps this battle would be a confrontation between two married people after being choked tightly by her husband Ida was extremely panicked and shouted iven wake up have you forgotten our promise he remained Silent not saying a word his face did not change at all only gradually tightening his grip making it hard for Ida to breathe on this side Nana hurried over shouting let her go but Ida stopped her not allowing her to come any closer Nana shouted loudly he is no longer iten he is just a puppet being controlled tears fell and Nana continued her voice choked with emotion of course I know my visual chips and sensory systems are all warning me but just seeing him makes me unbelievably happy eduin he was my teacher and my Lifesaver he saved me from the Queen's Army Pursuit taught me how to fight and together we gathered like-minded comrades to establish the resistance throughout that process we gradually became attached and got married looking back that was perhaps the happiest time of my life since the day I lost him my time has felt like it has stopped besides seeking Revenge I have nothing left Ida cried while continuing however the disparity and strength renders me completely powerless I can only cause trouble for the lone soldiers of the Queen's Army thanks to your majesty and Yu I was finally able to see you again if we were to die together like this it wouldn't be so bad hearing this Nana was incredibly horrified and immediately shouted die Ida what are you planning to do AA calmly replied I will activate the self-destruct device in my body once activated the entire weapons Factory will be destroyed everyone quickly leave Nano was deeply moved stunned for a moment before saying damn it Ida why are you being so foolish but if you've made your decision let's go Master don't let her sacrifice be in vain just as Nana was about to take Yu's hand and run she suddenly found he was gone huh where did Master go over here iven was trying to push Ida away but she held on tightly Aida resolutely said I will absolutely not let go of you let's go to that world together at that moment yiu appeared like a de calmly saying your courage is commendable but I have a better solution than death would you like to know Ida was utterly astonished when she realized she could no longer self-destruct the self-destruct device was broken vwu what have you done yiu snapped his fingers and calmly replied Ed the more effective approach to solve the problem just then something attacked him causing him to release Ida seeing her husband electrocuted and pushed back Ida was extremely anxious iuen noticing the situation immediately redirected his attack towards y he charged forward quickly locking onto his Target and preparing a high threat strike with the determination to eliminate yo in an instant iven landed a powerful punch on yiu creating a horrifying explosion that sent both girls into a panic however who was Yi Wu to Mechanical life forms he was practically Invincible with a gentle grip on aten's hand yiu smiled and said the judgment is quite accurate but it seems your calculation of power distance is still insufficient he then turned to AA and said leave him to me if you're lucky I will return a normal man to you but first I will let him suffer a little as soon as he finished speaking yiwu embraced iuen and soared high into the air to deal with him the two sides immediately began a fierce battle against each other after dodging several of iten's attacks y Wu transformed into an aircraft and launched missiles at him then he transformed into a car and charged straight at him leaving iten with no strength to resist Ida observing from a distance couldn't help but exclaim I can't believe it Yu was so powerful that he completely suppressed a tuen Nana with confidence said the master is still holding back otherwise iven would have been defeated a long time ago it seems Yu is analyzing something indeed yiu was trying to figure out how to save iuen in his heart he count calculated that the Queen's Consciousness still existed within aten's body and was closely linked to his core if he wanted to extract the Queen's Consciousness without killing him it would be extremely difficult suddenly a strong light emitted from within ID's body then stopped he no longer pursued ywu Yu saw this and felt quite surprised unexpectedly he changed his Target turned around and began to run away very quickly Ida seeing this scene from Below hurriedly said wait at tuen don't go y Wu observed the situation and thought to himself is he really planning to leave no I just detected a weak electrical signal could it be that he's going to transform into a human and jump to the ground Nana immediately asked should we chase after them Yu replied there's no need even if we pursue them now it would lead to no results from my observations the Queen's core Consciousness is within his body but to extract it we must completely destroy him upon hearing this both girls were astonished especially Ida she felt distressed hearing Yu's words isn't this too cruel after such a long time apart do we really have to say goodbye through death Nana stepped forward to comfort her saying we will find another way don't be too pessimistic just then a voice echoed sister your majesty and Mr yiu the guards of the Armory have been completely defeated please give us the next orders why don't we take this opportunity to directly storm the palace and deliver a decisive blow or just eliminate them all everyone chimed in haha I am looking forward to you sister we will follow you Nana said Ida you have an amazing team Ida unable to find words for her emotions smiled everyone realized that even though she no longer had her partner at least she still had teammates friends who would continue with her on the path ahead the two reached out to hold her hands and said Ida let's strive together believe that there will be a way now let's go meet the final boss Nana eagerly said so let's set off right away Iden was also in a hurry wanting to pull that impostor down from the throne Yu spoke up I know you all are very eager but hold on a moment with the current formation going to fight the final boss would mostly end in giving away our lives upon hearing that both girls broke out in a sweat what doesn't that mean even you don't have confidence in defeating her y wo helplessly explained I'm referring to you to specifically do you really think defeating a few Elite monsters is enough to take down the final boss AA scratched her head embarrassed and said he got a bit carried away and forgot the situation Nana pouted tears welling up and asked so what should we do yo pointed with pride think about it where are we right now Nana seemed a bit confused where aren't we in the soldier Factory suddenly Nana realized his meaning and said I understand now you want to take advantage of the war resources here to fight back against the enemy Army right ye W continue with satisfaction not just that don't forget we also have the information materials from the soul Library combining these two we can not only produce a large number of elite soldiers in a short time but also help you enhance your strength to f face your enemies Nana Nana's eyes lit up with pride for yiwu no wonder he is the master always so thoughtful yiu also didn't know how to deal with this girl perhaps it was due to her small brain thinking too little he snapped his fingers and thought that this large Soldier Factory must certainly have a warehouse dedicated to storing high-grade materials y Wu commanded whites find it for me Weiss began to pull up the map received a signal and started scanning suddenly it exclaimed here it is ywo you asked right away what have you discovered ywu immediately followed the little robot and where they arrived was all a gleaming gold wow this place has so many high-grade equipment and materials all rare very hard to find out there yiu began to examine closely searching for anything interesting one material caught his attention the Mind Control helmet it was once a relic of ancient psychic Sorcerers in Legend this helmet possesses mysterious Powers capable of manipulating the will of all things distorting reality and breaking the limits of the Mind the wearer becomes an invisible commander on the battlefield the effect of this helmet is that it can exert powerful mind control over one or multiple targets turning them into loyal slaves for 5 minutes unconditionally carrying out any orders from the wearer the success rate will be influenced by the spirit of the caster and the countermeasure time will be shortened when dealing with multiple targets simultaneously the warhold generation device is a technological Marvel of surpassing generations developed from the deepest explorations of the universe it has the ability to tear through the fabric of space connecting to distant latitudes and enabling faster than light travel this is the Ultimate Weapon and strategies of relocation and surprise assault after selecting the Target location in an instant the user and teammates within a certain range will be transported to the designated position bypass ing all limitations of terrain and distance the anti-gravity belt is a pinnacle work that combines science and Magic it grants the wear the ability to control gravity once considered an essential equipment for high-ranking explorers and astronauts upon activation the wearer escapes the constraints of gravity within a certain range can adjust the local gravitational field causing opponents to be delayed or creating a levitation effect additionally it can utilize anti-gravity techniques to generate a layer of energy shield made of antimatter derived from cosmic explosion debride this is one of the most powerful energy sources known and its existence poses a challenge to the material world any ordinary matter that comes into contact with it will be annihilated turning into nothingness in a magnificent explosion when integrating antimatter fibers into weapons or equipment it is possible to create energy attacks of a destructive nature even capable of releasing energy strong enough to lead to the rupture of latitudes in a short period yiu felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart as he instructed someone to carry the pile of items all of it consisted of materials he had never encountered on earth and the level of civilization here was at least twice that of Earth no wonder it was a planet created by Moss bringing these things back to improve the safe Zone would surely ensure that they would no longer be disturbed from the outside Yu suddenly remembered and asked Wise by the way what did you see earlier your serious expression has made be curious Weiss also responded earnestly master I need a little more time to think and analyze thoroughly please go strengthen Nana first Yu thought to himself Weiss has never shown such emotions before it seems that what it saw is certainly not ordinary thinking this he called out to Nana Nana come here I will take the materials on the spot and quickly complete the enhancement for you Nana surprised exclaimed right now all right I'm coming right away Yi Wu immediately Unleashed his power manipulating machinery and raw energy Nana's entire body was instantly enveloped by this power causing her to lay out a moan from the sensation this is my master directly analyzing the rare Metals converting them into energy and directly channeling them into my body my body is getting too hot I'm about to be fully replenished by my master land quickly activated Nana system interface to check the image and Pinnacle data of his majesty n had been completed and was ready for final enhancement at any moment Yu did not hesitate and began to execute the final enhancement helping Nana display her strongest stance all the essence of Yu's power surged into Nana she absorbed all these resources feeling each stream of power Rising within her body a new suit of armor gradually formed around Nana now she had taken on a new form the mechanized empress a perfect form Nana reached level 500 filled with Pride Nana declared At Last I have returned to my Peak reclaiming the true power that belongs to me I am now Invincible Ida and the group of soldiers cheered your majesty that's great just wonderful this time this planet will definitely be saved another person shouted this is the true body Our Queen our Majesty has truly returned at this moment Nana radiated the aura of a true Queen prepare for battle your loyal is commendable stand at ease and let us flatten the Palace of those traitorous wretches let us restore the glory of our home planet everyone responded in unison yes she rolled around beside gu woo mumbling master master do you see how beautiful I am now am I powerful y could only shake his head speechless powerful powerful my Nana is undoubtedly the best in the world the soldiers standing around were astonished one person whispered to to another is she really Our Queen did she just call them Master does it really mean Master Ida at this moment became Furious and shouted shut up if anyone dares to speak nonsense I will hang them up on a cannon to be obliterated suddenly a rift appeared in the sky causing everyone to feel anxious y wo confused asked is this a spatial transmission gate Weiss what have you done Weiss then explained this is a data fracture earlier I sensed data fluctuations in the space here a large amount of powerful data information was spilling out from the fracture so I analyze this information and simultaneously reverse engineered the spatial transmission gate I can't probe into what is inside the rift but the intensity of the data sensing is very high indicating that there must be Advanced and Powerful technology inside Yu kly asked is there any danger Weiss reported risk assessment is rated E so there shouldn't be any major danger upon hearing this Yu wed through the door and said then let's go take a look Ida immediately stopped him wait what if it's a trap Nana agreed that's right Master should we investigate a bit more carefully before they could finish speaking ye W interrupted you two were already among the top powerhouses what is there to fear besides isn't there still me both girls regained their confidence that's true true I've regained my strength what trap should we be afraid of Haida echoed if her majesty the queen isn't afraid then of course I will give it my all Yu looked at Landa and said I'll leave the matter of producing soldiers to you Landa accepted the responsibility nodding you can rest assured by the time you return perhaps I will have built an Elite Squad the three of them advaned towards the door together let's go and see what surprises this little refrain might bring up as they stepped out of the door all three were taken aback around them seemed to be some kind of cosmic space Yu stood calmly analyzing the situation it seems this is some planet in the universe AA couldn't understand how they had ended up in this place but ywu quickly checked the system and explained this is not a transmission this space seems to be a scene reenacted by projection as for what the content is it seems we are about to find out suddenly a cube appeared from that Planet Ida yelled look over there Nana was also panicked not knowing what it was the notification system indicated a new visitor had arrived and began projecting experiment images the cube started to separate unfolding and began the hunt for the planet in an instant it formed a layer of membrane around the planet points on the membrane continuously shot beams of light down to the planet the whole group watched in Surprise as the entire planet was gradually Metalized not only that it was is also transforming the planet into a preset form after the hunt and transformation were completed it switched to an absorption model predictions indicated that this process could last for 100 years Ida was frightened in just a moment the entire planet has been conquered it's too extravagant nanana became serious at this moment realizing that the energy from this process was expanding invading lower civilization levels indeed that wretched person only knew how to use such lowlevel tricks if it were when I still held absolute power I would certainly not let this happen yiu was still intently observing the shape and effects of this process he had only seen its theoretical form in documents prior to Earth's old transformation it was originally a purely imaginary product unexpectedly realized in reality the system continued to report end of projection thank you for watching please exit the space in an orderly manner VIP guests Yu was dumbfounded is that it Yu looked around feeling that these setups if not used would indeed be a waste just lying here Ida angrily said even in war people still leave survivors and resources but he hasn't given anyone a chance to live it's truly evil destroy this thing quickly y Wu stroked his chin responding leisurely evil is due to the user of the tool not because it is guilty itself I believe this thing can definitely be used moreover the import important thing is that I sense the power of the ancient god on it Nan asked in surprise huh what could it be made from the remnants of an ancient god ywu flew closer affirming it's quite possible and that's why I must obtain it he reached out to touch the queue in an era where Earth had been polluted and shrouded in many chaples of rules like the wild areas Misty lands or sacred tombs this thing could directly proceed to terraform the planet you w thought if combined with Moss's ability could it be used to reshape Earth could it break through the limitations and rules just as he touched the queue a powerful force pushed him away the screen displayed the message user does not have permission please do not operate against regulations yuu began stroking his chin thinking further even Moss's abilities cannot control it could it be that the power of the ancient god is repelling me he continued to calculate in his mind thinking I must defeat or tame it to gain control and command over it or I have to obtain the title king of machines to master it an quietly thought although I can't control it I shouldn't have any issues absorbing it right the system responded of course Master can put it into the system space and take it out whenever so yiu stored the cube in his pocket and then everyone went outside together the subordinate said big sister you finally returned Iden seeing the tense Expressions on everyone felt puzzled what's wrong you all look so nervous hearing the strange sound I was filled with Dread could this sound be from the queen yiu was confused the queen sound Nana also spoke up yes this is the Queen's unique ability she uses a special device and her voice to awaken the Loyalty of the Primal race towards her the essence of it is to disrupt the data in the body of each host a control skill that is almost almost impossible to break I've only heard about it in Intel reports before it's the first time I see her use it Ida was puzzled but why are we not affected Yu explained you have been modified by me no longer belonging to the Primal race so of course you won't be influenced but conversely we now have to oppose everyone on this planet are you all prepared Ida was filled with determination we have fought for so many years for this moment Nana was also ready ha to oppose the entire world this fits the mighty Aura of the queen returning y Wu also dawned his battle armor shouting then come let the final showdown begin the scene shifts to Mechanical Royal City where Celia Serita is still dressed in a seductive outfit producing melodic singing the citizens Below have been Enchanted for the queen to purge the traitors for the queen to purge the traitors at this moment Yu's Army filled with fighting Spirit charges is towards mechanical Royal City a large enemy Force has appeared ahead everyone prepare for battle they are all controlled puppets there is no need to hold back the great Creator please bless this old skeleton of mine upon arrival ywu pointed and commanded the advance both armies began to prepare to clash resulting in dramatic battle scene the battle erupted the sounds of metal clashing continuously echoed losses began to appear on both sides ywu soared into the Sky unleashing fire on several enemy flying insects Nana and Ida followed suit Master no matter how we kill these flying beasts they don't seem to end hiu said our goal is to break directly into mechanical Royal City there's no need to engage with these ants let's shake them off heida signaled Warriors clear the way for his majesty on the other side upon seeing three flying objects approaching the enemy directed all their cannons concentrate fire Yu summoned his fighter aircraft saying quickly get inside the true testing Time Has Come Nano walked in and saw y Wu charging straight into the path of the bullets panicking as she called out Master what are you planning to do do you want to fight headon but there's no time to dodge anymore y Wu piloted The Fighter Jet straight into the enemy's artillery Zone Syria stood within the Fortress smugly saying courage is commendable isn't it knowing you can't Dodge you choose to charge margin but no matter how strong your defense is you absolutely cannot Pierce through my absolute Firepower Network the only outcome for you is death hearing the self-satisfied words of the opponent y Wu w chuckled in response is that so then let's see this after saying that he activated the jump Wormhole move the fighter jet hurtling straight into the spatial gate and immediately piercing through entering inside the Fortress Syria witnessing this scene could only AP in shock exclaiming what the hell is that the transformative equipment was still on cool down and couldn't be used for 8 hours Syria did not expect Yu to be able to break through her defenses Yu's group landed right before the new Queen yiu looked at Siria coldly saying you truly have your tricks causing me quite a bit of trouble but you still underestimate me Seria shouted in Anger a mere insignificant life formed like you dares to speak arrogantly in front of me no what's important is that the person beside you is Nana Nana stepped forward confidently smiling as she said didn't expect it right I'm back again today I will reclaim what belongs to me from your hands
